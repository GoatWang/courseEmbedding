deficit of  we currently have  cash on hand our monthly expenses have historically been approximately  and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those expenses in the past the added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately  in recent months  thus even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public we have raised approximately  in small loans since september  there is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future we expect that we will not be able to continue operations beyond  months with our current available capital resources which presently consist of  in cash and our monthly revenues without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues we will need at a minimum  in capital to fund operations in the next  months   we plan to ramp up operations to generate additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses business development marketing costs and support materials we hope to raise  in this offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months   we do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations  there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us failure to raise additional financing will cause us to go out of business if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment   if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all   we have a limited operating history and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues or profitability  at this stage of our business even with our good faith efforts potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment   we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by a small emerging growth company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate since we have a limited operating history we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to fully meet our expenses and totally support our anticipated activities any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development marketing and sales of our mobile marketing systems and future products accordingly we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and any investor may lose their entire investment   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   at june   we have a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  since inception to june   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to generate future revenues will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include general economic conditions market acceptance of our mobile marketing systems proposed products and competitive efforts due to these factors we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods as such our independent registered public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment our company is suitable    table of contents   risks related to our business   we operate in an immature industry and have a relatively new business model which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects   we derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of marketing services which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changing user and client demands our business model is also evolving and is distinct from many other companies in our industry and it may not be successful as a result of these factors the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in an immature industry with an evolving business model such as ours some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to     ● maintain and expand client relationships   ● sustain and increase the number of customers on behalf of our clients marketing plans   ● manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational financial and management controls   ● raise capital at attractive costs or at all   ● successfully expand our footprint with existing clients and enter new client arrangments   ● respond effectively to competition and potential negative effects of competition on profit margins   ● attract and retain qualified management employees and independent service providers   ● successfully introduce new processes and technologies and upgrade our existing technologies and services and   ● respond to government regulations relating to the internet marketing in our client verticals personal data protection email software technologies and other aspects of our business   if we are unable to address these risks our business results of operations and prospects could suffer   our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain   our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following     ● current global economic and financial conditions as well as their impact on ecommerce financial services and the communications and internet industries   ● our success in direct marketing and promotional campaigns   ● any changes to the scope and success of marketing efforts by thirdparties   ● market acceptance of our services by our new customers   ● customer renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services   ● continued development of our distribution channels for our products and services   ● the impact of price changes in our products and services or our competitors products and services   ● the impact of decisions by distributors to offer competing or replacement products or modify or cease their marketing practices   ● the availability of alternatives to our products   ● seasonal fluctuations in business activity   ● changes in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services   ● potential attacks including hacktivism by nefarious actors which could threaten the perceived reliability of our products and services   ● changes in policies regarding internet administration imposed by governments or governmental authorities outside the us   ● potential disruptions in regional registration behaviors due to catastrophic natural events or armed conflict and   ● changes in the level of spending for information technologyrelated products and services by our customers     table of contents   our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred from our inception through june   we experienced a net loss of  from our business operations   due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline   the online and mobile marketing industry is highly competitive with many diverse competitors   many of our competitors are better funded than we are  the technology we rely on to generate revenue is changing rapidly and we may not be able to keep up with the technological developments  we do not hold patents or have any protectable intellectual property at this time that will prevent other competitors from developing our identical products and services and thereby controlling the market share of our industry   if we do not effectively manage our growth our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients   we hope to experience and to a certain extent have experienced rapid growth in our operations and we expect to experience further growth in our business both through acquisitions and internally this growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure in particular continued rapid growth and acquisitions may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following     ● successfully scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions   ● maintain our standing with key vendors including internet search companies and thirdparty website publishers   ● maintain our client service standards and   ● develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures in addition our personnel systems procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations the improvements required to manage our growth will require us to make significant expenditures expand train and manage our employee base and allocate valuable management resources if we fail to effectively manage our growth our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients key vendors and key personnel   we cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful which may result in a negative impact on our growth financial condition results of operations and cash flow   one of our strategies is to expand our client base through marketing and client acquisition programs we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base to a level that is needed to sustain ourselves and become profitable our inability to implement this growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth future financial condition results of operations or cash flows   poor perception of our business or industry as a result of the actions of third parties could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our clients’ websites and providing leads and clicks to our clients which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our clients there are companies within our industry that regularly engage in activities that our clients’ customers may view as unlawful or inappropriate these activities such as spyware or deceptive promotions by third parties may be seen by clients as characteristic of participants in our industry and therefore may have an adverse effect on the reputation of all participants in our industry including us any damage to our reputation including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry governmental proceedings consumer class action litigation or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations    table of contents   if we fail to compete effectively against other online and mobile marketing companies and other competitors we could lose clients and our revenue may decline   the market for online and mobile marketing is intensely competitive we expect this competition to continue to increase in the future we perceive only limited barriers to entry to the online marketing industry we plan to compete both for clients and for limited high quality advertising inventory we also plan to compete for clients on the basis of a number of factors including return on marketing expenditures price and client service   we plan to compete with internet and traditional media companies for a share of clients’ overall marketing budgets including     ● online or mobile marketing or media services providers   ● offline and online advertising agencies   ● major internet portals and search engine companies with advertising networks such as google yahoo msn and aol   ● other online marketing service providers including online affiliate advertising networks and industryspecific portals or lead generation companies   ● website publishers with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients   ● inhouse marketing groups at current or potential clients   ● offline direct marketing agencies and   ● television radio and print companies as a result we may not be able to compete successfully competition from other marketing service providers’ on and offline offerings could affect both volume and price and thus revenue if we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that other online marketing service providers achieve we could lose clients and our revenue may decline   if the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop our future growth may be limited and our revenue may decrease   the online and mobile marketing services market is relatively new and rapidly evolving and it uses different measurements than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness some of our current or potential clients have little or no experience using the internet for advertising and marketing purposes and have allocated only limited portions of their advertising and marketing budgets to the internet the adoption of internet and mobile advertising particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business exchanging information and evaluating new advertising and marketing technologies and services in particular we are dependent on our clients’ adoption of new metrics to measure the success of online marketing campaigns we may also experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies who may be advising our clients we cannot assure you that the market for online marketing services will continue to grow if the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate our ability to grow our business may be limited and our revenue may decrease   unauthorized access to or accidental disclosure of consumer personallyidentifiable information that we collect may cause us to incur significant expenses and may negatively affect our credibility and business   there is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet consumer identity theft and user privacy despite our implementation of security measures our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer breakins viruses and other disruptions and security breaches any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personallyidentifiable information regarding website visitors whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party employee theft misuse or error or otherwise could harm our reputation impair our ability to attract website visitors and attract and retain our clients or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers and thereby harm our business and operating results in addition we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information    table of contents   if we fail to keep pace with rapidlychanging technologies and industry standards we could lose clients or advertising inventory and our results of operations may suffer   the business lines in which we currently compete are characterized by rapidly changing internet and mobile marketing standards changing technologies frequent new product and service introductions and changing user and client demands the introduction of new technologies and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to these rapidlychanging internet and mobile media formats and other technologies we will need to enhance our existing technologies and services and develop and introduce new technologies and services to address our clients’ changing demands if we fail to adapt successfully to such developments or timely introduce new technologies and services we could lose clients our expenses could increase and we could lose advertising inventory   limitations on our ability to collect and use data derived from user activities could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenue   when a user visits our clients’ websites we use technologies including “cookies” to collect information such as the user’s internet protocol or ip address offerings delivered by us that have been previously viewed by the user and responses by the user to those offerings in order to determine the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and to determine how to modify the campaign we need to access and analyze this information the use of cookies has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation and users are able to block or delete cookies from their browser periodically certain of our clients and publishers seek to prohibit or limit our collection or use of this data interruptions failures or defects in our data collection systems as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection of user data could also limit our ability to analyze data from our clients’ marketing campaigns this risk is heightened when we deliver marketing services to clients in the financial and medical services client verticals if our access to data is limited in the future we may be unable to provide effective technologies and services to clients and we may lose clients and revenue   we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers which could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results   most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of net  days if any of our customers becomes insolvent or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our services our results of operations could be harmed   we are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   under the jumpstart our business startups act “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”    table of contents   risks related to our management and control persons   because wais asefi currently owns  of our outstanding common stock investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by mr asefi are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders    mr asefi currently owns  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly mr asefi will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control while we have no current plans with regard to any merger consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets the interests of mr asefi may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders   our sole officer and director may leave us if we are unable to repay the  note that he guaranteed with his personal shares   in order to obtain a loan of  our sole officer and director had to pledge  of his personal shares to the lender  if we default on the loan the lender could foreclose on those shares and there would be a considerable change in control of our company  we may lose the services of mr asefi if that happens which will adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan and survive   because we have a substantial financial commitment to our chief executive officer through an employment agreement funds may be diverted away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position   we entered into an employment agreement with mr asefi our officer and director the agreement continues until may   and provides annual compensation of  this is a lot of money for us to pay we have limited funds available and any money we are able to raise combined with our existing cash balances will be needed to fulfill this substantial financial commitment we may not be able to raise enough money to fund the contract in addition money that could be spent elsewhere will be needed to fund the contract and will divert funds away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position   the loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our ability to continue operations   we are entirely dependent on the efforts of our ceo president and chief financial officer because of the time and effort that he devotes to us he is in charge of overseeing all development strategies supervising anyall future personnel including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our business model and the establishment of our future sales team their loss or other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on our officers directors or key employees our success will depend on the performance of mr asefi and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel   the lack of public company experience of our sole officer and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   our sole officer and director mr asefi has no experience managing a public company which could adversely impact our ability to comply with legal regulatory and reporting requirements of us securities laws  our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner to adequately respond to such legal regulatory and reporting requirements including the establishment and maintenance of internal controls over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  which are necessary to maintain public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to operate as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company our ability to operate successfully may depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with appropriate experience in the management of a public company  our ability to find and retain qualified personnel on our terms and budget may be very limited    table of contents   risks related to ownership of our shares   as there is no minimum for our primary offering if only a few persons purchase units they may lose their investment as we may be unable to make a significant attempt to implement our business plan   since there is no minimum amount of units that must be sold directly under this primary offering if a limited number of units are sold we may not have enough capital to fully implement our plan of operations as such we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus or eliminate the “going concern” modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses any significant lack of funds will curtail the growth of our business and may cause our business to fail  if our business fails investors will lose their entire investment   we are selling this primary offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any units   this primary offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the units  we intend to sell our units through our president chief executive officer and chief financial officer who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made hereunder they will offer the units to friends family members and business associates however there is no guarantee that they will be able to sell any of the units unless they are successful in selling all of the units and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this primary offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations    table of contents   we may have difficulty selling shares under our primary offering because the selling shareholders are concurrently offering their shares under the secondary offering   we may have difficulty selling shares under our primary offering because we may be competing with the selling security holders who are concurrently offering their shares under the secondary offering in the event that our common shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb the selling security holders will not be required to sell their shares at a fixed price of  per share  accordingly the selling security holders may reduce the price of their shares which may hinder our ability to sell any shares under the primary offering   if we do not keep this registration statement updated for the term of the warrants the stockholders will not be able to exercise the warrants under the registration statement   warrant holders may seek to exercise their warrants to obtain common stock that they could sell in the public market however an effective registration statement and current prospectus must exist for the warrant holders to exercise their warrants in the event a current prospectus is not available when a warrant holder wishes to exercise the warrant holder will be unable to exercise their warrants at such time that the warrant holder wishes or when it would be economically advisable for the warrant holder upon exercise the underlying common stock can be sold pursuant to this prospectus which we intend to update for the earlier of september   the date the warrants expire or until all the warrants have been exercised there is no assurance that we will be able to keep such prospectus effective for that long  in the event that the prospectus is not effective at a time that the shareholder wishes to sell common stock underlying the warrants the shareholder may find it difficult to sell such common stock   we will likely conduct further offerings of our equity securities in the future in which case your proportionate interest may become diluted   since our inception we have relied on sales of our common shares to fund our operations  we will likely be required to conduct additional equity offerings in the future to finance our current projects or to finance subsequent projects that we decide to undertake if common shares are issued in return for additional funds the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current shareholders we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to fund our business operations if we issue additional shares your percentage interest in us could become diluted   because we do not plan to register our common stock under section g of the exchange act until december   we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements only under section d which requirements are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under section  of the exchange act and thus there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time   as we will not register our common stock under section g of the exchange act until december of  we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements under section d which are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under section  of the exchange act until such date for example as a section d reporting company we are not subject to the proxy rules section  shortswing profits prohibitions and reporting requirements under sections d and g of the exchange act that we would be if we did register our common stock under section g of the exchange act prior to december of  and thus there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time    table of contents   if we do not file a registration statement under form a to become subject to the reporting requirements under section  of the exchange act prior to december   our periodic reporting obligations under section d will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders is less than  which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb   if we do not file a registration statement under form a to become subject to the reporting requirements under section  of the exchange act prior to december   the end of our first full fiscal year during which time we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under section d of the exchange act including an annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   our periodic reporting obligations under section d will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders is less than  which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with sec and your access to our business information will be restricted  in addition if we do not become a reporting issuer we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act   if a market for our common shares does not develop shareholders may be unable to sell their shares   our common stock is quoted on the otcpinks operated by otc markets group inc under the symbol “txhd” on august   the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the otcpinks was  per share  there is not an active trading market for our stock we intend to apply for quotation of our common shares on the otc bulletin board or otcqb  however we can provide no assurance that our shares will be approved for quotation on the otc bulletin board or if traded that a public market will materialize  if our common shares are not quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb or if a public market for our common shares does not develop shareholders may not be able to resell the common shares that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment   because our directors are not independent they can make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other common shareholders   we intend to apply to have our common shares quoted on the otc bulletin board interdealer quotation system or otcqb neither of which have director independence requirements  using the definition of “independent” in nasdaq rule a we have determined that none of our directors are independent our directors have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  they also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon among other things the results of our operations cash flows and financial condition operating and capital requirements and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant there is no assurance that future dividends will be paid and if dividends are paid there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend    table of contents   our securities are considered a penny stock   because our securities are considered a penny stock shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their shares brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on nasdaq the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares   cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements  the actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements  our actual results are most likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this

years the number of mobile marketing options and companies have grown rapidly the markets for the products and services that we offer are very competitive are rapidly evolving and have relatively low barriers to entry we compete with all general advertising and marketing companies who eventually will want to include mobile marketing in their suite of product offerings and who may develop their own similar products and compete with us for market share these potential competitors may have more mature lines of distribution than us be better financed than us or may create a product offering that is superior to ours any of these factors can cause a competitor to take market share away from us or otherwise substantially hurt our business we believe that competition in our market is based predominantly on     ● price   ● brand recognition   ● product and service components and deliverables   ● track record of creating and keeping satisfied clients   ● success of underlying marketing programs and   ● order delivery performance and customer service    table of contents   government regulation   we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business in the mobile messaging market many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business  existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover online marketing email marketing telemarketing taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business   we expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation in addition the application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection marketing advertising consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled   in addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally the us federal communications commission or fcc has examined or is currently examining how and when consumers enroll in mobile services what types of disclosures consumers receive what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers’ personal information consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained used and shared with other companies consumer groups have asked the ftc to identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare examine optin procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used investigate marketing tactics that target children and create policies to halt abusive practices the ftc has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data such as locationbased information   the principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform include     ● deceptive trade practice law in the us  the ftc and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices these laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising the general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be “clearly and conspicuously” disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision the balancing of the desire to capture a potential customers attention while providing adequate disclosure can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures     ● behavioral advertising  behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individuals webbrowsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made to select which advertisements to display to that individual this data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geotags through mobile devices many businesses adhere to industry selfgoverning principles including an optout regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected the ftc is considering regulations in this area which may include implementation of a more rigorous optin regime an optin policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented among other things the implementation of an optin regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services a few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state these bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing statespecific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer there have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising     ● behavioral advertisingprivacy regulation  our business is affected by us federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users in recent years regulation has focused on the collection use disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual such as an internet protocol address or a name although the mobile and internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely selfregulated in the us the ftc has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate including regulation of nonpersonally identifiable information which could with other information be used to identify an individual     ● marketingprivacy regulation  in addition there are us federal and state laws that govern sms and telecommunicationsbased marketing generally requiring senders to transmit messages including those sent to mobile devices only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages us federal laws also govern email marketing generally imposing an optout requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship     ● sms and locationbased marketing best practices and guidelines  we are a member of the mobile marketing association or mma a global association of  agencies advertisers mobile device manufacturers wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel the mma has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities the guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service we voluntarily comply with the mma code of conduct in addition the cellular telephone industry association or ctia has developed best practices and guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding locationbased services we also voluntarily comply with those guidelines which generally require notice and user consent for delivery of locationbased services     ● the united states telephone consumer protection act   the tcpa prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephonedialing system atds unless the recipient has given prior consent the statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national donotcall list and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent violations of the tcpa can result in statutory damages of  per violation ie for each individual text message us state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls we believe that our platform does not employ an atds within the meaning of the tcpa based on case law construing that term    table of contents      ● canspam  the us controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act or can spam act prohibits all commercial email messages as defined in the law to mobile phones unless the device owner has given express prior authorization recipients of such messages must also be allowed to optout of receiving future messages the same way they optedin senders have ten business days to honor optout requests the fcc has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial email messages senders have  days from the date the domain name is posted on the fcc site to stop sending unauthorized commercial email to addresses containing the domain name violators are subject to fines of up to  million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities carriers the ftc the fcc and state attorneys general may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the act     ● communications privacy acts  foreign and us federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage     ● security breach notification requirements  in the us various states have enacted data breach notification laws which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information this new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions including by the us at the federal level as well     ● children  the childrens online privacy protection act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of  without verifiable parental consent and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information in addition it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose   intellectual property   although we believe that our business methodology is proprietary in terms of how we deliver our service to our client and how we use mobile marketing we currently hold no patents copyrights or trademarks it is our plan to trademark our key products as we develop them subject to applicable

of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and ii our obtaining a sufficient number of stockholders to enable our common shares to become quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb  however we can provide no assurance that our shares will be quoted on the bulletin board or if quoted that a public market will materialize   the securities exchange commission has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system  the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the commission that a contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading b contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws c contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask  priced contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actionse defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks andf contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the commission shall require by rule or regulation   the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock the customer with a bid and offer quotations for the penny stockb the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transactionc the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and d a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement   these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules therefore because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities   dividend rights   we have never declared nor paid any dividend since our incorporation and does not foresee paying any dividend in the near future since all available funds will be used to conduct exploration activities  any future payment of dividends will depend on our financing requirements and financial condition and other factors which the board of directors in its sole discretion may consider appropriate   there are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends  the nevada revised statutes however do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend      we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or      our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution   we have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements december   and    note  – summary of significant

as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations while the company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty   risks and uncertainties   the company is subject to substantial risks from among other things intense competition associated with the industry in general other risks associated with financing liquidity requirements rapidly changing customer requirements limited operating history and the volatility of public markets   fair value measurements   accounting standards codification “asc”  fair value measurements defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under asc  as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the note principal or the most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value which are the following     ● level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     ● level   inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities     ● level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities   the fair value of the accounts receivable accounts payable notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements december   and    note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   convertible instruments   the company accounts for convertible debt with beneficial conversion features in accordance with asc  which requires the company to recognize separately at issuance the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt the recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount the intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date   warrants   the company accounts for warrants issued in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method under this method the value of warrants issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the blackscholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional paidin capital   the company recognized the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the blackscholes pricing model the company recorded the relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paidin capital and discount against the related debt the discount attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   the company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts    accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect the company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable historical collection information and existing economic conditions as of december   and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and bad debt expense

revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured   thus we recognize subscription revenue on a monthly basis as services are provided customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis at the customer’s option   income taxes   income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future federal and state income taxes any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense any penalties are recorded in operating expenses   net income loss per common share   basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive     since the company reflected a net loss for the year ended december   and  the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been antidilutive and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented   recent accounting pronouncements   no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements   note  – accounts receivable and factoring agreement   in the ordinary course of business the company utilizes accounts receivablecredit card factoring agreements with thirdparty financing company in order to accelerate its cash collections from product sales in addition these agreements provide the company with the ability to limit credit exposure to potential bad debts to better manage costs related to collections as well as to enable customers to extend their credit terms these agreements involve the ownership transfer of eligible trade accounts

whollyowned subsidiary textmunication inc collectively referred to as the company all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited   note  – summary of significant

states of america   going concern   these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business as of june   the company has an accumulated deficit of  the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations while the company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty   risks and uncertainties   the company is subject to substantial risks from among other things intense competition associated with the industry in general other risks associated with financing liquidity requirements rapidly changing customer requirements limited operating history and the volatility of public markets   fair value measurements   accounting standards codification “asc”  fair value measurements defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under asc  as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the note principal or the most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value which are the following   ● level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   ● level   inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   ● level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities   the fair value of the accounts receivable accounts payable notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited   note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   convertible instruments   the company accounts for convertible debt with beneficial conversion features in accordance with asc  which requires the company to recognize separately at issuance the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt the recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount the intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date   warrants   the company accounts for warrants issued in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method under this method the value of warrants issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the blackscholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional paidin capital   the company recognized the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the blackscholes pricing model the company recorded the relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paidin capital and discount against the related debt the discount attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   the company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts    accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect the company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable historical collection information and existing economic conditions as of june   and december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and bad debt expense was  for the three and six months ended june   and    advertising   advertising expenses consist primarily of costs of promotion for corporate image and product the

to consolidated financial statements unaudited   note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification or “asc”  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured   thus we recognize subscription revenue on a monthly basis as services are provided customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis at the customer’s option   income taxes   income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future federal and state income taxes any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense any penalties are recorded in operating expenses   net income loss per common share   basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive     since the company reflected a net loss for the three and six months ended june   the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been antidilutive and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented the company did not have any common stock equivalents during the three and six months ended june     recent accounting pronouncements   no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements   reclassifications

order to compensate him and all of the above managerial and administrative support we will require  in the next twelve months   marketing plan and personnel   the goal is to build engaging content for potential clients to make it clear what we do and that we excel at it the target audience for potential and existing clients is primarily small to medium businesses   our objectives to meet this goal

restaurant style     retail  automotive clothing apparel car washes   as we continue to grow sales teams will be added in each targeted customer group according to geographic region   from our past experience one team should be able to reach out to  contacts and yield  demos per month  with this forecast which is really just an estimate one team could generate  in new sales per month we hope to hire  teams for a total of  in the next twelve months     table of contents    we will have one sales director over teams and more may be added as our company grows and our geographical customer base expands  the sales director is responsible for leading and developing the sales team organizing and assigning industry specifics and regions and working hand in hand with current and new partners for sustained growth   we have one sales director already and do not plan on using the proceeds of this offering to hire anymore   professional fees   we expect to spend roughly  in professional fees for legal and accounting support in the next twelve months   our budget   we have broken down all of the above expenses in the section of this prospectus titled “use of proceeds”  our optimum level of growth for success will be achieved if we are able to raise  in the next twelve months  with our primary offering we hope to accomplish this goal  however funds are difficult to raise in today’s economic environment thus we have allocated funds in the use of proceeds if we are unable to raise  according to percentages of net proceeds received  if we are unable to raise  our ability to implement our business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished we do not have a minimum amount of funds to raise in the primary offering thus if we are unable to enough money to pay our expenses and meet our goals you could lose your entire investment tin our business   we have generated revenue but we have experienced a history of losses at june   we had cash on hand of  and accumulated a deficit of  we currently have  cash on hand our monthly expenses have historically been approximately  and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those expenses in the past the added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately  in recent months  thus even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public we have raised approximately  in small loans since september  there is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future we expect that we will not be able to continue operations beyond  months with our current available capital resources which presently consist of  in cash and our monthly revenues without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues we will need at a minimum  in capital to fund operations in the next  months   we plan to ramp up operations to generate additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses business

companies turning to mobile marketing as a way to communicate and engage with their memberscustomers   we expect that our integration with customer relation management crm systems to collect a unified view of customer behavior with analytics and mobile usage behavior data as well as data from other sources such as accounting or order processing systems will become easier to integrate in  as most merchant software will have an open api to work with our client’s data base this will allow our customers to compile customer data in a way that is more easily measurable and actionable we believe

carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common shares if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common shares if we publicly trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our financial condition   if we do not obtain additional financing our business expansion plans will be delayed and we may not achieve profitable operations   we may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development or to provide adequate cash flow for planned business activities at june   we had cash on hand of  and accumulated a deficit of  we currently have  cash on hand our monthly expenses have historically been approximately  and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those expenses in the past the added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately  in recent months thus even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public we have raised approximately  in small loans since september  there is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future we expect that we will not be able to continue operations beyond  months with our current available capital resources which presently consist of  in cash and our monthly revenues without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues we will need at a minimum  in capital to fund operations in the next  months   we plan to ramp up operations to generate additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses business development marketing costs and support materials we hope to raise  in this offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months   we do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us failure to raise additional financing will cause us to go out of business if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment   if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all   we have a limited operating history and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues or profitability at this stage of our business even with our good faith efforts potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment   we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by a small emerging growth company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate since we have a limited operating history we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to fully meet our expenses and totally support our anticipated activities any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development marketing and sales of our mobile marketing systems and future products accordingly we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and any investor may lose their entire investment   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   at june   we have a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  since inception to june   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to generate future revenues will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include general economic conditions market acceptance of our mobile marketing systems proposed products and competitive efforts due to these factors we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods as such our independent registered public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment our company is suitable    table of contents   risks related to our business   we operate in an immature industry and have a relatively new business model which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects   we derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of marketing services which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changing user and client demands our business model is also evolving and is distinct from many other companies in our industry and it may not be successful as a result of these factors the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in an immature industry with an evolving business model such as ours some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to      ● maintain and expand client relationships    ● sustain and increase the number of customers on behalf of our clients marketing plans    ● manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational financial and management controls    ● raise capital at attractive costs or at all    ● successfully expand our footprint with existing clients and enter new client arrangments    ● respond effectively to competition and potential negative effects of competition on profit margins    ● attract and retain qualified management employees and independent service providers    ● successfully introduce new processes and technologies and upgrade our existing technologies and services and    ● respond to government regulations relating to the internet marketing in our client verticals personal data protection email software technologies and other aspects of our business   if we are unable to address these risks our business results of operations and prospects could suffer   our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain   our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following      ● current global economic and financial conditions as well as their impact on ecommerce financial services and the communications and internet industries    ● our success in direct marketing and promotional campaigns    ● any changes to the scope and success of marketing efforts by thirdparties    ● market acceptance of our services by our new customers    ● customer renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services    ● continued development of our distribution channels for our products and services    ● the impact of price changes in our products and services or our competitors products and services    ● the impact of decisions by distributors to offer competing or replacement products or modify or cease their marketing practices    ● the availability of alternatives to our products    ● seasonal fluctuations in business activity    ● changes in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services    ● potential attacks including hacktivism by nefarious actors which could threaten the perceived reliability of our products and services    ● changes in policies regarding internet administration imposed by governments or governmental authorities outside the us    ● potential disruptions in regional registration behaviors due to catastrophic natural events or armed conflict and    ● changes in the level of spending for information technologyrelated products and services by our customers    table of contents   our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred from our inception through june   we experienced a net loss of  from our business operations   due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline   the online and mobile marketing industry is highly competitive with many diverse competitors   many of our competitors are better funded than we are the technology we rely on to generate revenue is changing rapidly and we may not be able to keep up with the technological developments we do not hold patents or have any protectable intellectual property at this time that will prevent other competitors from developing our identical products and services and thereby controlling the market share of our industry   if we do not effectively manage our growth our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients   we hope to experience and to a certain extent have experienced rapid growth in our operations and we expect to experience further growth in our business both through acquisitions and internally this growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure in particular continued rapid growth and acquisitions may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following      ● successfully scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions    ● maintain our standing with key vendors including internet search companies and thirdparty website publishers    ● maintain our client service standards and    ● develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures   in addition our personnel systems procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations the improvements required to manage our growth will require us to make significant expenditures expand train and manage our employee base and allocate valuable management resources if we fail to effectively manage our growth our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients key vendors and key personnel   we cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful which may result in a negative impact on our growth financial condition results of operations and cash flow   one of our strategies is to expand our client base through marketing and client acquisition programs we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base to a level that is needed to sustain ourselves and become profitable our inability to implement this growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth future financial condition results of operations or cash flows   poor perception of our business or industry as a result of the actions of third parties could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our clients’ websites and providing leads and clicks to our clients which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our clients there are companies within our industry that regularly engage in activities that our clients’ customers may view as unlawful or inappropriate these activities such as spyware or deceptive promotions by third parties may be seen by clients as characteristic of participants in our industry and therefore may have an adverse effect on the reputation of all participants in our industry including us any damage to our reputation including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry governmental proceedings consumer class action litigation or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations    table of contents   if we fail to compete effectively against other online and mobile marketing companies and other competitors we could lose clients and our revenue may decline   the market for online and mobile marketing is intensely competitive we expect this competition to continue to increase in the future we perceive only limited barriers to entry to the online marketing industry we plan to compete both for clients and for limited high quality advertising inventory we also plan to compete for clients on the basis of a number of factors including return on marketing expenditures price and client service   we plan to compete with internet and traditional media companies for a share of clients’ overall marketing budgets including      ● online or mobile marketing or media services providers    ● offline and online advertising agencies    ● major internet portals and search engine companies with advertising networks such as google yahoo msn and aol    ● other online marketing service providers including online affiliate advertising networks and industryspecific portals or lead generation companies    ● website publishers with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients    ● inhouse marketing groups at current or potential clients    ● offline direct marketing agencies and    ● television radio and print companies   as a result we may not be able to compete successfully competition from other marketing service providers’ on and offline offerings could affect both volume and price and thus revenue if we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that other online marketing service providers achieve we could lose clients and our revenue may decline   if the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop our future growth may be limited and our revenue may decrease   the online and mobile marketing services market is relatively new and rapidly evolving and it uses different measurements than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness some of our current or potential clients have little or no experience using the internet for advertising and marketing purposes and have allocated only limited portions of their advertising and marketing budgets to the internet the adoption of internet and mobile advertising particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business exchanging information and evaluating new advertising and marketing technologies and services in particular we are dependent on our clients’ adoption of new metrics to measure the success of online marketing campaigns we may also experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies who may be advising our clients we cannot assure you that the market for online marketing services will continue to grow if the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate our ability to grow our business may be limited and our revenue may decrease   unauthorized access to or accidental disclosure of consumer personallyidentifiable information that we collect may cause us to incur significant expenses and may negatively affect our credibility and business   there is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet consumer identity theft and user privacy despite our implementation of security measures our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer breakins viruses and other disruptions and security breaches any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personallyidentifiable information regarding website visitors whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party employee theft misuse or error or otherwise could harm our reputation impair our ability to attract website visitors and attract and retain our clients or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers and thereby harm our business and operating results in addition we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information    table of contents   if we fail to keep pace with rapidlychanging technologies and industry standards we could lose clients or advertising inventory and our results of operations may suffer   the business lines in which we currently compete are characterized by rapidly changing internet and mobile marketing standards changing technologies frequent new product and service introductions and changing user and client demands the introduction of new technologies and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to these rapidlychanging internet and mobile media formats and other technologies we will need to enhance our existing technologies and services and develop and introduce new technologies and services to address our clients’ changing demands if we fail to adapt successfully to such developments or timely introduce new technologies and services we could lose clients our expenses could increase and we could lose advertising inventory   limitations on our ability to collect and use data derived from user activities could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenue   when a user visits our clients’ websites we use technologies including “cookies” to collect information such as the user’s internet protocol or ip address offerings delivered by us that have been previously viewed by the user and responses by the user to those offerings in order to determine the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and to determine how to modify the campaign we need to access and analyze this information the use of cookies has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation and users are able to block or delete cookies from their browser periodically certain of our clients and publishers seek to prohibit or limit our collection or use of this data interruptions failures or defects in our data collection systems as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection of user data could also limit our ability to analyze data from our clients’ marketing campaigns this risk is heightened when we deliver marketing services to clients in the financial and medical services client verticals if our access to data is limited in the future we may be unable to provide effective technologies and services to clients and we may lose clients and revenue   we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers which could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results   most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of net  days if any of our customers becomes insolvent or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our services our results of operations could be harmed   we are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   under the jumpstart our business startups act “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”    table of contents   risks related to our management and control persons   because wais asefi currently owns  of our outstanding common stock investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by mr asefi are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders    mr asefi currently owns  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly mr asefi will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control while we have no current plans with regard to any merger consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets the interests of mr asefi may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders   our sole officer and director may leave us if we are unable to repay the  note that he guaranteed with his personal shares   in order to obtain a loan of  our sole officer and director had to pledge  of his personal shares to the lender if we default on the loan the lender could foreclose on those shares and there would be a considerable change in control of our company we may lose the services of mr asefi if that happens which will adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan and survive   because we have a substantial financial commitment to our chief executive officer through an employment agreement funds may be diverted away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position   we entered into an employment agreement with mr asefi our officer and director the agreement continues until may   and provides annual compensation of  this is a lot of money for us to pay we have limited funds available and any money we are able to raise combined with our existing cash balances will be needed to fulfill this substantial financial commitment we may not be able to raise enough money to fund the contract in addition money that could be spent elsewhere will be needed to fund the contract and will divert funds away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position   the loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our ability to continue operations   we are entirely dependent on the efforts of our ceo president and chief financial officer because of the time and effort that he devotes to us he is in charge of overseeing all development strategies supervising anyall future personnel including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our business model and the establishment of our future sales team their loss or other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on our officers directors or key employees our success will depend on the performance of mr asefi and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel   the lack of public company experience of our sole officer and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   our sole officer and director mr asefi has no experience managing a public company which could adversely impact our ability to comply with legal regulatory and reporting requirements of us securities laws our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner to adequately respond to such legal regulatory and reporting requirements including the establishment and maintenance of internal controls over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  which are necessary to maintain public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to operate as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company our ability to operate successfully may depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with appropriate experience in the management of a public company our ability to find and retain qualified personnel on our terms and budget may be very limited    table of contents   risks related to ownership of our shares   as there is no minimum for our primary offering if only a few persons purchase units they may lose their investment as we may be unable to make a significant attempt to implement our business plan   since there is no minimum amount of units that must be sold directly under this primary offering if a limited number of units are sold we may not have enough capital to fully implement our plan of operations as such we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus or eliminate the “going concern” modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses any significant lack of funds will curtail the growth of our business and may cause our business to fail if our business fails investors will lose their entire investment   we are selling this primary offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any units   this primary offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the units we intend to sell our units through our president chief executive officer and chief financial officer who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made hereunder they will offer the units to friends family members and business associates however there is no guarantee that they will be able to sell any of the units unless they are successful in selling all of the units and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this primary offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations   we may have difficulty selling shares under our primary offering because the selling shareholders are concurrently offering their shares under the secondary offering   we may have difficulty selling shares under our primary offering because we may be competing with the selling security holders who are concurrently offering their shares under the secondary offering in the event that our common shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb the selling security holders will not be required to sell their shares at a fixed price of  per share accordingly the selling security holders may reduce the price of their shares which may hinder our ability to sell any shares under the primary offering   if we do not keep this registration statement updated for the term of the warrants the stockholders will not be able to exercise the warrants under the registration statement   warrant holders may seek to exercise their warrants to obtain common stock that they could sell in the public market however an effective registration statement and current prospectus must exist for the warrant holders to exercise their warrants in the event a current prospectus is not available when a warrant holder wishes to exercise the warrant holder will be unable to exercise their warrants at such time that the warrant holder wishes or when it would be economically advisable for the warrant holder upon exercise the underlying common stock can be sold pursuant to this prospectus which we intend to update for the earlier of september   the date the warrants expire or until all the warrants have been exercised there is no assurance that we will be able to keep such prospectus effective for that long in the event that the prospectus is not effective at a time that the shareholder wishes to sell common stock underlying the warrants the shareholder may find it difficult to sell such common stock   we will likely conduct further offerings of our equity securities in the future in which case your proportionate interest may become diluted   since our inception we have relied on sales of our common shares to fund our operations we will likely be required to conduct additional equity offerings in the future to finance our current projects or to finance subsequent projects that we decide to undertake if common shares are issued in return for additional funds the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current shareholders we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to fund our business operations if we issue additional shares your percentage interest in us could become diluted    table of contents   because we do not plan to register our common stock under section g of the exchange act until december   we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements only under section d which requirements are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under section  of the exchange act and thus there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time   as we will not register our common stock under section g of the exchange act until december of  we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements under section d which are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under section  of the exchange act until such date for example as a section d reporting company we are not subject to the proxy rules section  shortswing profits prohibitions and reporting requirements under sections d and g of the exchange act that we would be if we did register our common stock under section g of the exchange act prior to december of  and thus there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time   if we do not file a registration statement under form a to become subject to the reporting requirements under section  of the exchange act prior to december   our periodic reporting obligations under section d will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders is less than  which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb   if we do not file a registration statement under form a to become subject to the reporting requirements under section  of the exchange act prior to december   the end of our first full fiscal year during which time we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under section d of the exchange act including an annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   our periodic reporting obligations under section d will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders is less than  which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with sec and your access to our business information will be restricted in addition if we do not become a reporting issuer we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act   if a market for our common shares does not develop shareholders may be unable to sell their shares   our common stock is quoted on the otcpinks operated by otc markets group inc under the symbol “txhd” on august   the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the otcpinks was  per share there is not an active trading market for our stock we intend to apply for quotation of our common shares on the otc bulletin board or otcqb however we can provide no assurance that our shares will be approved for quotation on the otc bulletin board or if traded that a public market will materialize if our common shares are not quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb or if a public market for our common shares does not develop shareholders may not be able to resell the common shares that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment   because our directors are not independent they can make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other common shareholders   we intend to apply to have our common shares quoted on the otc bulletin board interdealer quotation system or otcqb neither of which have director independence requirements using the definition of “independent” in nasdaq rule a we have determined that none of our directors are independent our directors have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets they also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders    table of contents   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon among other things the results of our operations cash flows and financial condition operating and capital requirements and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant there is no assurance that future dividends will be paid and if dividends are paid there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend   our securities are considered a penny stock   because our securities are considered a penny stock shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their shares brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on nasdaq the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares

intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements the actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements our actual results are most likely to differ

services that we offer are very competitive are rapidly evolving and have relatively low barriers to entry we compete with all general advertising and marketing companies who eventually will want to include mobile marketing in their suite of product offerings and who may develop their own similar products and compete with us for market share these potential competitors may have more mature lines of distribution than us be better financed than us or may create a product offering that is superior to ours any of these factors can cause a competitor to take market share away from us or otherwise substantially hurt our business we believe that competition in our market is based predominantly on      ● price    ● brand recognition    ● product and service components and deliverables    ● track record of creating and keeping satisfied clients    ● success of underlying marketing programs and    ● order delivery performance and customer service    table of contents   government regulation   we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business in the mobile messaging market many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover online marketing email marketing telemarketing taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business   we expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation in addition the application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection marketing advertising consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled   in addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally the us federal communications commission or fcc has examined or is currently examining how and when consumers enroll in mobile services what types of disclosures consumers receive what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers’ personal information consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained used and shared with other companies consumer groups have asked the ftc to identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare examine optin procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used investigate marketing tactics that target children and create policies to halt abusive practices the ftc has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data such as locationbased information   the principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform include      ● deceptive trade practice law in the us  the ftc and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices these laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising the general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be “clearly and conspicuously” disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision the balancing of the desire to capture a potential customers attention while providing adequate disclosure can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures          ● behavioral advertising  behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individuals webbrowsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made to select which advertisements to display to that individual this data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geotags through mobile devices many businesses adhere to industry selfgoverning principles including an optout regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected the ftc is considering regulations in this area which may include implementation of a more rigorous optin regime an optin policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented among other things the implementation of an optin regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services a few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state these bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing statespecific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer there have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising          ● behavioral advertisingprivacy regulation  our business is affected by us federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users in recent years regulation has focused on the collection use disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual such as an internet protocol address or a name although the mobile and internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely selfregulated in the us the ftc has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate including regulation of nonpersonally identifiable information which could with other information be used to identify an individual    table of contents      ● marketingprivacy regulation  in addition there are us federal and state laws that govern sms and telecommunicationsbased marketing generally requiring senders to transmit messages including those sent to mobile devices only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages us federal laws also govern email marketing generally imposing an optout requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship          ● sms and locationbased marketing best practices and guidelines  we are a member of the mobile marketing association or mma a global association of  agencies advertisers mobile device manufacturers wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel the mma has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities the guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service we voluntarily comply with the mma code of conduct in addition the cellular telephone industry association or ctia has developed best practices and guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding locationbased services we also voluntarily comply with those guidelines which generally require notice and user consent for delivery of locationbased services          ● the united states telephone consumer protection act    the tcpa prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephonedialing system atds unless the recipient has given prior consent the statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national donotcall list and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent violations of the tcpa can result in statutory damages of  per violation ie for each individual text message us state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls we believe that our platform does not employ an atds within the meaning of the tcpa based on case law construing that term          ● canspam  the us controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act or can spam act prohibits all commercial email messages as defined in the law to mobile phones unless the device owner has given express prior authorization recipients of such messages must also be allowed to optout of receiving future messages the same way they optedin senders have ten business days to honor optout requests the fcc has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial email messages senders have  days from the date the domain name is posted on the fcc site to stop sending unauthorized commercial email to addresses containing the domain name violators are subject to fines of up to  million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities carriers the ftc the fcc and state attorneys general may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the act          ● communications privacy acts  foreign and us federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage          ● security breach notification requirements  in the us various states have enacted data breach notification laws which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information this new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions including by the us at the federal level as well          ● children  the childrens online privacy protection act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of  without verifiable parental consent and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information in addition it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose    table of contents   intellectual property   although we believe that our business methodology is proprietary in terms of how we deliver our service to our client and how we use mobile marketing we currently hold no patents copyrights or trademarks it is our plan to trademark our key products as we develop them subject to applicable laws and regulations however we have

of this prospectus there were  registered shareholders   no public market for common shares   our common stock is quoted on the otcpinks operated by otc markets group inc under the symbol “txhd” on august   the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the otcpinks was  per share there is no public information about our company as noted by otcpinks and there is not an active trading market for our stock   we anticipate making an application for quotation of our common shares on the otc bulletin board or otcqb upon i the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and ii our obtaining a sufficient number of stockholders to enable our common shares to become quoted on the otc bulletin board or otcqb however we can provide no assurance that our shares will be quoted on the bulletin board or if quoted that a public market will materialize   the securities exchange commission has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the commission that a contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading b contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws c contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask priced contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actionse defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks andf contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the commission shall require by rule or regulation    table of contents   the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock the customer with a bid and offer quotations for the penny stockb the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transactionc the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and d a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement   these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules therefore because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities   dividend rights   we have never declared nor paid any dividend since our incorporation and does not foresee paying any dividend in the near future since all available funds will be used to conduct exploration activities any future payment of dividends will depend on our financing requirements and financial condition and other factors which the board of directors in its sole discretion may consider appropriate   there are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends the nevada revised statutes however do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend       we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or           our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution   we have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to

concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business as of december   the company has an accumulated deficit of  the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations while the company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty   risks and uncertainties   the company is subject to substantial risks from among other things intense competition associated with the industry in general other risks associated with financing liquidity requirements rapidly changing customer requirements limited operating history and the volatility of public markets   fair value measurements   accounting standards codification “asc”  fair value measurements defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under asc  as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the note principal or the most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value which are the following     ● level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         ● level   inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities         ● level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities   the fair value of the accounts receivable accounts payable notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements december   and    note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   convertible instruments   the company accounts for convertible debt with beneficial conversion features in accordance with asc  which requires the company to recognize separately at issuance the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt the recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount the intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date   warrants   the company accounts for warrants issued in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method under this method the value of warrants issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the blackscholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional paidin capital   the company recognized the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the blackscholes pricing model the company recorded the relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paidin capital and discount against the related debt the discount attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   the company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts    accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect the company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables the company provides an allowance for

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured   thus we recognize subscription revenue on a monthly basis as services are provided customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis at the customer’s option   income taxes   income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax

recovered or settled deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future federal and state income taxes any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense any penalties are recorded in operating expenses   net income loss per common share   basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive     since the company reflected a net loss for the year ended december   and  the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been antidilutive and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented   recent accounting pronouncements   no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected

disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under asc  as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the note principal or the most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc  must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value which are the following     ● level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         ● level   inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities         ● level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities   the fair value of the accounts receivable accounts payable notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value   f  table of contents   textmunication holdings inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited   note  – summary of significant accounting policies

issuance the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt the recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount the intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date   warrants   the company accounts for warrants issued in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method under this method the value of warrants issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the blackscholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional paidin capital   the company recognized the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the blackscholes pricing model the company recorded the relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paidin capital and discount against the related debt the discount attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   the company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its

that are available to offset future federal and state income taxes any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense any penalties are recorded in operating expenses   net income loss per common share   basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive     since the company reflected a net loss for the three

systems engineering social media efforts and graphic design on an asneeded basis  we do not have employment agreements or written consulting agreements with any of our personnel except for our ceo

  marketing plan and personnel   the goal is to build engaging content for potential clients to make it clear what we do and that we excel at it the target audience for potential and existing clients is primarily small to medium businesses   our objectives to meet this goal include the following     ● revamping our website and setting up google analytics for tracking seo and keywords         ● setting up accounts for facebook and linkedin for paid advertisements         ● designing and participating in various social media sites         ● blogging preparing newsletters and engaging in email campaigns and         ● hosting web seminars with attendance driven by the foregoing   to accomplish these objectives we will need to hire bloggers programmers and graphic web and video developers  we

money for conventions and advertise for facebook linkedin and other social media we estimate these expenses at  for the next twelve months    table of contents   sales personnel   we intend to hire

centers massage hotels etc     entertainment  golf comedy bars  nightclubs casinos bowling etc     food  restaurant  qsr and restaurant style     retail  automotive clothing apparel car washes   as we continue to grow sales teams will be added in each targeted customer group according to geographic region   from our past experience one team should be able to reach out to  contacts and yield  demos per month  with this forecast which is really just an estimate one team could generate  in new sales per month we hope to hire  teams for a total of  in the next twelve months      we will have one sales director over teams and more may be added as our company grows and our geographical customer base expands  the sales director is responsible for leading and developing the sales team organizing and assigning industry specifics and regions and working hand in hand with current and new partners for sustained growth   we have one sales director already and do not plan on using the proceeds of this offering to hire anymore   professional fees   we expect to spend roughly  in professional fees for legal and accounting support in the next twelve months   our budget   we have broken down all of the above expenses in the section of this prospectus titled “use of proceeds”  our optimum level of growth for success will be achieved if we are able to raise  in the next twelve months  with our primary offering we hope to accomplish this goal  however funds are difficult to raise in today’s economic environment thus we have allocated funds in the use of proceeds if we are unable to raise  according to percentages of net proceeds received  if we are unable to raise  our ability to implement our business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished we do not have a minimum amount of funds to raise in the primary offering thus if we are unable to enough money to pay our expenses and meet our goals you could lose your entire investment tin our business   we have generated revenue but we have experienced a history of losses at june   we had cash on hand of  and accumulated a deficit of  we currently have  cash on hand our monthly expenses have historically been approximately  and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those expenses in the past the added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately  in recent months  thus even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public we have raised approximately  in small loans since september  there is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future we expect that we will not be able to continue operations beyond  months with our current available capital resources which presently consist of  in cash and our monthly revenues without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues we will need at a minimum  in capital to fund operations in the next  months   we plan to ramp up operations to generate additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses business development marketing costs and support materials we hope to raise  in this offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months    table of contents   results of operation for the years ended december   and    revenues   for the year ended december   we earned revenues in the amount of  as compared with revenues of  for the year ended december   our increase revenues from  to  has been due to clients upgrading their accounts from smaller packages to larger monthly subscriptions as a result of the success they have been experiencing with their mobile marketing programs  we have seen steady growth in sales from clients asking to increase their sms volume which in turn increases their monthly subscription costs  we expect this trend to continue in our ongoing operations   we believe our focus on select industries will provide better customer service and further increase sales in our ongoing operations  our future growth plans are in the following verticals health and fitness golf courses and quick service restaurants  our plan is to onboard  new health and fitness gyms to complement the  in our existing sales pipeline through our partner companies such as clubready abc financial money movers cfg retention group and other current partners in the health and fitness industry  based on our current targeted marketing vertical we are also expecting to bring on  golf courses and  united states air force bases   we believe there is a current trend to expand mobile marketing as an effective means of marketing to customers  we are seeing more and more companies turning to mobile marketing as a way to communicate and engage with their memberscustomers   we expect that our integration with customer relation management crm systems to collect a unified view of customer behavior with analytics and mobile usage behavior data as well as data from other sources such as accounting or order processing systems will become easier to integrate in  as most merchant software will have an open api to work with our client’s data base this will allow our customers to compile customer data in a way that is more easily measurable and actionable we believe this ease of use will stimulate increased sales in our ongoing operations   we further anticipate that our
