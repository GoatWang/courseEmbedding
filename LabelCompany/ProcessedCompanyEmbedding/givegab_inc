those parts i did not know how to use the staff helped me they were kind patient and timely with this software we were able to reach  of our fundraising goal the previous year we did not have access to this software we met  of that goal cons this software was linked to another system so we did not get full credit for our fundraising efforts on this platform we are excited that this feature will be added this year overall able to fundraise even though i have limited experience and resources to reach our intended audience i love the chat feature quick responses polite and helpful staff jul   michelle whitley codirector healing hooves inc health wellness and fitness  employees used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support

experience is over all positive jul   eveline smith executive director seedlings of change used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros what i liked most was that the give gab website is very much user friendly setting up our pages was a fairly smooth process for me as im not an it individual so it is truly user friendly also when i did need some help the customer service chat on line feature was very efficient cons i have nothing negative to report seedlings of change is signed up with both missoula gives and montana gives and so it would be helpful to have a way to reflect the totals collected in both combined rather than completely separate this feature would be helpful overall my experience is good sometimes i would like a little more information about a topic jun   judy bland volunteer marks project used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros the ease of signing up and logging hours also saving time sending out notices to members and the reports that can be generated

functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros the peertopeer fundraising feature is the best there is  seriously its easy attractive and as the administrator i appreciate that changes i make on the organizational page carry through to peer pages cons i have only  complaints first the email we and our fundraisers get at the end of a campaign that says girls inc of holyoke has ended it has second i have the worst time trying to get the header photos for a campaign to fit the page ive tried everything and no matter what i do it gets recropped stretched or otherwise looks weird great customer service so easy to use jun   douglas oroark executive director math circles of chicago used the software for  months  overall    ease

of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros ease of use features such as profile setup were nice easy to link a bank customer support emails were helpful cons customer response is misleading there is an instant message that pops up but its just a bot a little frustrating vendor response by givegab on june   scott thank you so much for your positive comments regarding how easy givegab is to use  we truly appreciate it regarding your comment about our chat feature being a bot the support tool we use has real live people responding sometimes our support tool tries to answer questions with prompt feedback through artificial intelligence so we can improve which may have been what you encountered as a bot the customer success team aims to respond within  hours to a chat  but sometimes the bot answers questions before we do in a small percentage of conversations this is usually before  am or after  pm est we still follow up after the fact to ensure your question was answered im sorry you were misled in who you were chatting with rest assured there is always a human on the other end and we are more than happy to help you with anything you might need  very easy to use and the customer service is great they are always there to help and happy to do so jun   lauren pristach program coordinator algonquin sports for kids inc nonprofit organization management  employees used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros how easy it is to use you can use it for any type of fundraiser and make each page look unique also the customer service they are always on hand to let help you and teach you how to fix the program in the future cons the would you like to cover the fees button isnt easy for all donors to see so it often gets overlooked in my opinion overall easy fundraising that has allowed us to raise money for a variety of events easy to use jun   chad reu chapter president pflag san antonio used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros i enjoy that i now have a list of donors  to assist with donor database to assist with future campaigns and events cons i like to feel supported however i do feel the amount of emails received was a bit excessive possibly weekly emails after the big give sa but daily was a bit much we used the free platform for a few campaigns  loved how easy and user friendly this program is jun   dawn bothkim secretary of board of directors wnypbn used the software for  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros very easy to set up our campaigns then donors get instant gratification seeing their donations and comments posted immediately on the site it looks so professional and sleek i cant wait to use it for our upcoming memorial walk event cons working as a volunteer for my not for profit organization i fear for every penny we endeavor to collect i feel that the paid platforms are a little pricey but understand that the developers need to make money too overall professional looking donation platform that is user friendly as well as making the set up easy i love the analytics when compiling data after a campaign platform was easy to use and response was quick when i had questions jun   donna kinsey volunteer fundraiser greater middletown interfaith council used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros easy to enter information in the fields for dollar amounts that we requested also easy to upload photos and video the directions were easy to understand for someone that was not very computer savvy cons there were not many negatives to the software i suppose it would have benefited our nonprofit to have more than  hours for the giving day smooth functioning stylish fun not totally customizable overall very easy to manage jun   nicole slevin communications manager cornell cooperative extension sullivan county used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros i like the options for fundraising levels the style designs and the simple format the friendly staff respond pretty quickly updates help me keep track and act as reminders love the fundraising summary for our finance manager cons i didnt like that i couldnt just edit a campaign i had to start a new one in order to generate a different link givegab allows me to reach people i would not otherwise come in contact with thanks a lot jun   annie butler volunteer coordinator contact helpline used the software for  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros all you have to do is follow the instructions i like its simplicity being able to sign on without a hassle knowing where you want to go and how to get there is really easy always easy to use and its features inspire donors to give jun   thelma uranga communications  development manager national museum of mexican art used the software for  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros i like that donors can see the status of a campaign and create teams visually i like the way that photosvideos integrate into a campaign cons i wish that the administrator could select whether donors cover the fee as opposed to donors having that option i have been really pleased with my user experience so far jun   cara baribeau vp marketing  communications community foundation of louisville used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros love the look and feel  creates a positive impression and user experience staff has been responsive patient kind and fun to work with cons wish we had a little more flexibility to export info from the participating nonprofits but so far weve found ways to work around or get what we need at the registration phase the real test will be having our giving day go off without a hitch small nonprofit very satisfied with givegab feb   brandon mustful executive director great river rescue nonprofit organization management  employees used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros it is easy to use and fun cons past volunteer

happy with our experience givegab provides some awesome services that are easy to use and we always get support when needed givegab has been an amazing tool and i recommend it to other nonprofits recommendations to other buyers you get out what you put in i love the everything about givegab feb   lynne conway volunteer and philanthropic programs manager spca of tompkins county nonprofit organization management  employees used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros ease of use cons we have a complicated event registration with fundraising goals and registration fees we needed the registration fees to not be counted towards the registrants goal it was hard to sort it all out but finally we did to some fashion overall we have used givegab for multiple online campaigns  they offer a superb product with extraordinarily helpful friendly and educated support staff creating a campaign is easy with their software they have fresh contemporary and uncluttered design options with a few different color schemes so your campaigns dont always look alike it is easy to present a cohesive campaignevent with their easytofill text boxes and variety of drop down menus you can use for event registration if needed the reports are generated with a click of a button and are emailed right to you at work i actually liked getting in the back end of the system to work what lay person ever says that previously we had been working with a competitor to givegab i was always stressed about their software not functioning well and their people being hours away and essentially strangers to our nonprofit when we left the competitor it took them more than one year to reach out to us to ask why i simply told them that the givegab product was superior the technical support staff a dream and the fact that they givegab is a national company with a hardworking local vibe sealed the deal you will not be disappointed if you choose givegab recommendations to other buyers like in anything there are glitches in life and art you just have to be creative to work through
