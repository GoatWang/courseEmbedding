past five years inflation growth rates in developed economies have barely budged hovering below  coming out of the global financial crisis global gross domestic product gdp growth was stuck below its long term average of  from  to  this extended period of low growth kept inflationary factors at depressed levels in particular tightened credit markets and low confidence in the broad economy had the most adverse effects on inflation these factors limited both businesses and consumers from spending more driving prices higher furthermore the end of a decadelong commodity cycle kept input costs at extremely low levels source the world bank recently however economic signs of life indicate that inflation is on the verge of returning to normal levels the price of oil has rebounded off of its lowest point since  the housing market is healthy purchases of consumer durable goods such as automobiles surged  over the past year and according to factset research systems wages have begun to rise as the labor force has regained traction after massive displacements caused by the global financial crisis these economic data points have led the us consumer price index cpi to rise  in the  months through december  the largest increase since june  additionally inflation accelerated for the fifth consecutive month source factset research systems additional factors have also raised inflation expectations in  and beyond fed chair janet yellen has longheld a position of allowing inflation to run past its  target in order to reverse the negative effects of the great recession proposed policies of president donald j trump are expected to further drive inflation rates higher president trump is expected to push for up to  trillion from congress to upgrade infrastructure introduce major tax cuts deregulate industry and implement a number of protectionist trade policies in the coming year these factors are all expected to drive inflation higher outside the us other signs are surfacing as well the eurozone recorded a  rise in consumer prices yoy in january despite a turbulent brexit vote and plummeting currencies factory prices in china are rising and wages in japan have risen to their highest levels since  why should investors care about inflation rising inflation positively impacts borrowers of existing debt if real interest rates are negative producers that

nothing is being done to address it at the money management institute mmi the national association for the investment advisory solutions industry we have cultivated a program that purposefully addresses this issue headon the gateway to leadership program was established in  and is designed to introduce qualified minority students to the investment advisory solutions business through the program we place candidates from historically black colleges and universities hbcus in paid summer internships with leading financial services firms and fellow mmi members brinker capital has been
