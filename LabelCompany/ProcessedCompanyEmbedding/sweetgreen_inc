by bigname investors like steve case danny meyer and daniel boulud hits all of the right notes in today’s food industry—healthy fresh organic and local the recipe has resonated with diners who keep lines long at sweetgreen’s  locations“we’re creating a brand that stands for something” says coceo nathaniel ru “we want to feed more people better food”but traditional chains could learn about more than just food from the company’s coceos the georgetown university classmates have been tech pioneers and  of sweetgreen transactions are made through its website or mobile app “technology has always been part of our dna” ru saysthe trio are also rethinking management strategies to stay close to customers sweetgreen almost completely shuts down the corporate office five times per year so that everyone can work in its restaurants the company which recently opened offices in los angeles operates without a main headquarters the coceos are bicoastal as they try to grow the company
