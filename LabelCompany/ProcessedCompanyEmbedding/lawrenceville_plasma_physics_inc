lppfusionempowering the worldcompeting technologiesyou are herehomefusion powercompeting technologiesnuclear power – fission reactors current nuclear reactors use uranium or plutonium fission to produce electricity in fission an atom will split apart into two smaller atoms and some high energy neutrons which produce more fission reactions there are many ways a radioactive atom can split apart into the two smaller atoms called reaction products but these reaction products all have one thing in common they are all radioactive there has been no viable solution as to what to do with this radioactive waste some of which will be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years or more another danger comes from the highenergy neutrons these neutrons slam into whatever is in their path this creates heat which in a nuclear power plant is used to boil water to run a steampowered generator however heat is not the only thing neutrons produce a neutron can enter the nucleus of a nonradioactive atom and make it radioactive so fission power plants have three problems with radioactivitythe fuel is radioactivethe reaction products are radioactivethe highenergy neutrons can take ordinary materials in the reactor building and make them radioactive of course the same technology that is used to make reactor fuel can also make the more purified fuel of atomic weapons finally nuclear reactors generate electricity by the same method that edison developed—steam turbines this means that fission reactors can never be extremely cheap since most of the cost is in the energy conversion system deuteriumtritium fusion with tokamaks nuclear fusion has the potential to generate power without the radioactive waste of nuclear fission but most fusion research today is focused on fusing deuterium and tritium using tokamaks which are large highlycomplex devices when deuterium and tritium are heated to sufficiently high temperatures about  million degrees they fuse producing helium and high energy neutrons these neutrons create heat and radioactive materials just as in a fission reactor deuterium and helium are not radioactive and occur in nature tritium however is radioactive and does not occur in nature it must be created in the reactor by using neutrons so deuteriumtritium fusion still has two of the disadvantages of nuclear fission the highenergy neutrons can take ordinary materials in the reactor building and make them radioactivesome of the fuel—tritium—is radioactivein addition tokamaks are by their nature very large expensive and complex devices using powerful magnets to keep the hot plasma in place it is not at all clear that they could ever produce net energy but if they did it would be more expensive than that produced in fission reactors since the steam conversion would be the same and the energy producing core would be more expensive comparison with focus fusion in contrast focus fusion reactors using the plasma focus device and hydrogenboron fuel would produce almost no neutrons at all and no radioactivity induced in the structure the energy comes out as a beam of charged particles helium nuclei or alpha particles which can be converted directly into electricity making the reactors compact and cheapmenujoin an eventcrowdfundget involveddiscussvolunteershop fusiondonatenews archives search news archives search select

extremely intense hard xray source using a dense plasma focus dpf device such a source transportable by truck will allow economical nondestructive inspection of the nation’s critical infrastructure leading to savings in repair costs of at least five billion dollars annually this technology is ready for mass production and we are currently looking to sell out to the highest bidder a source with the power photon energy and adjustability developed in this project will allow the use of compton scattering in which the xrays are scattered off the material being probed and return to a detector on the same side of the object as the source compton scattering requires far higher xray power than does direct xray scanning in which the detector is on the opposite side of the structure from the source but has the great advantage that scanning can be done from one side such oneside scanning will greatly reduce the cost and time of inspections making possible the timely preventive maintenance of infrastructure such as bridges roads and buildings the xray source technology is being developed as a “spinoff” of our mediumterm research into the use of the dpf device as a source for nuclear waste free nuclear fusion energy essentially the same technology can produce both useful clean energy and extremely intense xray pulses in february  lppf achieved a major milestone by measuring

within a few seconds lppfusionempowering the worldexecutive summaryyou are herehomeexecutive summarylawrenceville plasma physics inc dba lppfusion is researching an innovative approach to nuclear fusion our approach differs from others in the following ways small inexpensive machinery conventional fusion approaches use huge expensive machinery magnets or lasers to compress hot gas plasma enough to fuse the atomic nuclei and release energy we use nature to achieve this our device called a dense plasma focus dpf creates a magnetic bottle that compresses itself due to natural instabilities of plasma our dpf harnesses these instabilities instead of fighting them it fits in a small room and could be massproduced and sold for  – m no radioactive waste conventional approaches are fueled with deuterium and radioactive tritium their fusion produces highenergy neutrons which gradually destroy machinery and turn it radioactive our fusion fuel is abundant hydrogen and boron which produces no highenergy neutrons aneutronic fusion our dpf can never melt down never pollute the environment and requires no costly containment structure or radioactive waste disposal direct generation of electricity conventional approaches produce heat that drives steam turbines to generate electricity our approach avoids this costly process most energy is produced as a beam of nontoxic helium ions which directly generates electricity in a form of hightech stepdown transformer no steam turbines are required while innovative our approach is based on proven laws of classical and quantum physics unlike “cold fusion” claims our research is published in peerreviewed scientific journals in march  the leading journal of its field physics of plasmas published our paper describing proof that we achieved two of the three conditions required to fuse hydrogenboron and produce net energy more released than put in the first condition is plasma temperature of  billion degrees c we achieved  billion which is the hottest ever reported for a fusion fuel and hotter than the core of the sun the other conditions are sufficient confinement time which we also achieved and sufficient plasma density which we expect to achieve soon we expect this because our mathematical model of the dpf is derived from physical laws not mere trialanderror the model led us to design improvements that we patented in the us  and other nations some pending the model has been confirmed by years of experiments and it predicts that design improvements we are now implementing will produce the breakthrough or net fusion energy sought around the world for  years in november  our approach was evaluated by an independent committee of senior fusion scientists chaired by a former director of us fusion research their conclusion “…the lpp dpf approach to fusion power has considerable merit and that a much higher level of investment is warranted based on their considerable progress to date” we seek m from accredited or otherwise qualified investors in addition to m already raised for our current research phase with this funding we expect to demonstrate net fusion energy from hydrogenboron fuel in  months then we plan a  year engineering phase leading to the nonexclusive licensing of our technology to large manufacturers our megawatt fusion generators are projected to cut the cost of electricity by over  due to their small size low capital and fuel costs clean operation and direct generation of electricity each generator will power approximately  homes or mobile applications such as ships trains or electric planes we project this could cut global co emissions by up to  gigatons per year by  soon enough to prevent the worst effects of climate changemenujoin an

feasibility of focus fusion on january   lpp published preliminary results in march  the company published a paper saying that it had achieved temperatures of  billion degrees beating the old record of  billion that had survived since  one independent expert stated that they were not close to a commercial fusion reactor with this device in  the company announced a collaboration with a lab at the islamic azad university central tehran branch in iran lerner is also an active general science writer estimating that he has had about  articles published he has received journalism awards between  and  from the aviation space writers association in  he was a visiting scientist at the european southern observatory in chile the big bang never happenededit the big bang never happened a startling refutation of the dominant theory of the origin of the universe  is lerners controversial book which rejects mainstream big bang cosmology and instead advances a nonstandard plasma cosmology originally proposed by hannes alfvén in the s the book appeared at a time when results from the cosmic background explorer satellite were of some concern to astrophysicists who expected to see cosmic microwave background anisotropies but instead measured a blackbody spectrum with little variation across the sky lerner referred to this as evidence that the big bang was a failed paradigm he also denigrated the observational evidence for dark matter and recounted a well known cosmological feature that superclusters are larger than the largest structures that could have formed through gravitational collapse in the age of the universe as an alternative to the big bang lerner adopted alfvéns model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most if not all cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces adopting an eternal universe lerners explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model of thermodynamics based on the work of the nobel chemistry prize winner ilya prigogine under which order emerges from chaos this is in apparent defiance of the second law of thermodynamics as a way of partially acknowledging this lerner asserts that away from equilibrium order can spontaneously form by taking advantage of energy flows as argued more recently by eric chaisson an american astrophysicist lerners ideas have been rejected by the professional physicists and cosmologists who have reviewed them in these critiques critics have explained that contrary to lerners assertions the size of superclusters is a feature limited by subsequent observations to the end of greatness and is consistent with having arisen from a power spectrum of density fluctuations growing from the quantum fluctuations predicted in inflationary models anisotropies were discovered in subsequent analysis of the both cobe and boomerang experiments and were more fully characterized by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and planck physical cosmologists who have commented on the book have generally dismissed it in particular edward l wright the american astrophysicist and cosmologist was critical of lerner for making errors of fact and interpretation and criticized specifics of lerners alternative cosmology making the following critiques lerners alternative model for hubbles law is dynamically unstable the number density of distant radio sources falsifies lerners explanation for the cosmic microwave background lerners explanation that the helium abundance is due to stellar nucleosynthesis fails because of the small observed abundance of heavier elements lerner has disputed wrights critique activismedit while at columbia lerner participated in the  selma march and helped organize the  columbia student strike in the s lerner became involved in the national caucus of labor committees an offshoot of the columbia university students for a democratic society lerner left the national caucus in  later stating in a lawsuit that he had resisted pressure from the us labor party an organization led by lyndon larouche to violate election law by channeling profits of an engineering firm to the organization more

of some concern to astrophysicists who expected to see cosmic microwave background anisotropies but instead measured a blackbody spectrum with little variation across the sky lerner referred to this as evidence that the big bang was a failed paradigm he also denigrated the observational evidence for dark matter and recounted a well known cosmological feature that superclusters are larger than the largest structures that could have formed through gravitational collapse in the age of the universe as an alternative to the big bang lerner adopted alfvéns model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most if not all cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces adopting an eternal universe lerners explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model

astrophysicist lerners ideas have been rejected by the professional physicists and cosmologists who have reviewed them in these critiques critics have explained that contrary to lerners assertions the

experimental job in physics i have to say this was probably one of the most rewarding research projects i have ever been involved in eric is knowledgeable committed and out of the box when it comes to his approaches to problem solving and everyone was very welcoming of me my ideas were heard and listened to whenever they held solid merit and the progress that was made during my time there was great for a company that is not even listed on the fusion science projects list under the department of energy every idea and plan of attack is well thought out and always verified with a specialist in the field to ensure steps are taken properly as part of my fellowship my senior year i research several renewable energy sources and several renewable energy research projects focused on fusion research and i honestly can say that i wouldnt be surprised if lpp fusion inc is a name that becomes more well known in the coming years james ray · i researched lppfusion quite a bit including reading through their private placement memorandum and reading through their first paper i think the technology has potential but i would be skeptical about investing more than  or even  with ones total investments not risking more than one is prepared to lose of ones capital as there is no guarantee that it will work and their claim that it can have a levelised cost of electricity of  us cents is a tall one considering that they have not even achieved net energy production yet the dense plasma focus may not have yields that are higher than the scaling law despite lerners hypothesis that the dpf can have similar pinching phenomena as that which occurs in quasars even if they overcome their current issues with impurities in the vacuum chamber if they cant achieve yields that scale much more than the current scaling law of dpfs which they havent then it would require a larger reactor than what they predict even the size of iter or a tokamak then again even if a very large reactor is required the electricity generation could be converted directly from a beam of charged particles rather than via a significantly more expensive steam turbine on the other hand if a large reactor is required the disadvantage of that is that centralised energy generally has more drawbacks than distributed energy eg more network augmentation required less ability for end users of electricity to be empowered pun intended and decentralised energy trading is not available steven marsh · i think this is a valid path for scientific inquiry because i have personally used plasma to vaporize steel also i think that for humans to be able to move on from an economic system that rewards the domination of resources and exploitation of political systems that we desperately need an energy system like this if it works then great if it doesnt then we will have learned a great deal from this and the other experimental approaches being tried and we must try them all in the meantime there are lots of awesome investment opportunities in sharedpublic transit and existing renewable energy technologies that we must and are pursuing so despite the disconcerting nature of the changes that we are experiencing the future is bright indeed to me the single most important thing that i look forward to is the possibility that at last we will have achieved an economic system that rewards innovation instead of exploitation max

thanks to andy spreadbury for bringing this to our attention i am mainly drawing from there website for information httpwwwlawrencevilleplasmaphysicscom the claims made in this article are their own and being reported as information only i look forward to everyone’s take on thislawrenceville plasma physics lpp objective is  the development of an ecologicaly safe fusion energy generator using a device called the dense plasma focus dpf and hydrogenboron fuel we call this “focus fusion” this work was initially funded by nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory and is now backed by over forty private investors including the abell foundation of baltimore  lpp’s patented technology and peerreviewed science are guiding the design of this technology for this virutally unlimited source of clean energy that can be significantly cheaper than any other energy sources currently in useunlike zeropoint energy and cold fusion which are based on new physical theories or at least new interpretations of exiting theories aneutronic fusion with a dense plasma focus device which we call focus fusion is based on an original application of very wellconfirmed scientific theories such as electromagnetism and quantum mechanics no “new physical theories” are invoked indeed we are utilizing natural phenomena that have been observed at much large scales in the universe– in solar flares for examplevideoyoutube pczeistahow is focus fusion differentin current nuclear reactors energy is produced through nuclear fission here a neutron breaks apart a uranium nucleus releasing energy and more highenergy neutrons the nuclear fragments produced are highly radioactive they naturally decay and give off their own energetic radiation in addition the neutrons smash into the nuclei of atoms in the reactor structure transmuting them to radioactive nuclei as well all of these radioactive atoms constitute nuclear wastethe form of nuclear fusion that the us government has funded which uses deuterium and tritium as fuel also produces some radioactive waste although far less than fission tritium a form of hydrogen with two additional neutrons is itself radioactive when deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse together they produce nucleus of harmless and nonradioactive helium and a neutron but the high energy neutron that carries most of the energy of the reaction can again smash into the reactor’s structure making it radioactivein focus fusion however none of this occurs the fuel that will be used consists of hydrogen and boron both are harmless nonradioactive substances when hydrogen nuclei protons and boron nuclei fuse together at extremely high temperatures they produce only helium nuclei and no neutronsa secondary reaction occurs when some helium nuclei fuse with boron nuclei which does produce some neutrons but these reactions are rare and only th of the energy is emitted in the form of neutrons more important none of these neutrons have enough energy to transform the materials they hit into longlived radioactive materials so no such radioactive materials are produced in the reactor structure hydrogenboron reactors would be free of longlived radioactivity and the small number of neutrons emitted could easily be absorbed in several inches of shieldingfocus fusion reactors are so safe that anyone could safely enter the reactor room seconds after it had been turned off even if it had previously been functioning for a yearprogress to datebrief history of lpp’s focus fusion development timelines while the dense plasma focus device referred to as dpf or pf has existed for  years progress with the dpf has been impeded mainly by a lack of good quantitative theoretical models of the tiny plasmoid where the fusion reactions take place there are too many parameters in the dpf device to allow progress on a purely empirical basis  the anode and cathode radii electrode length shape of the anode and especially anode tip length of insulator charging voltage fill pressure fill gas and so on without a good theory dpf research is like wandering in a sixdimensional desert looking for small oases this means that there has been until recently apart from our own work no good way of predicting in advance the size density magnetic field and ion and electron energies of the plasmoids ultradense selfconfined blobs of plasma in the dpf given initial conditionslawrenceville plasma physics or lpp for short beginning in the ’s developed a detailed quantitative theory of dpf device operation which has been successfully tested against experiments that we performed in collaboration with the university of illinois in  and with texas am university in  this theory including important refinements that include magnetic effects gives us the ability unique among dpf groups to show in advance that hydrogenboron fusion is feasible now in the past two years other dpf groups are working along closer lines making collaboration feasible and speeding research – a small team of physicists led by lerner achieved temperatures above one billion degrees in a plasma focus device high enough for hydrogenboron reactions  this breakthrough reported at an international scientific conference in may  took place at texas am university and was funded by nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory – lpp was incorporated  lerner presented new theoretical analysis at the prestigious th symposium on current trends in international fusion research in washington dc showing that the magnetic field effect could greatly reduce the cooling of hydrogenboron plasma by xray emission and make the production of net energy far easier  the presentation was favorably received by some of the top fusion experts in the world – lpp completed a preliminary simulation of plasmoids that burned protonboron pb fuel  the simulation results confirmed that net energy production is possible with a small focus fusion device – lpp submitted a patent application to the us patent office  the patent application entitled “method and apparatus for producing xrays ion beams and nuclear fusion energy” covers the use of high magnetic fields the quantum magnetic field effect in the production of fusion energy the injection of angular momentum into the plasma sheath and a new method of converting xray energy into electricity  – eric lerner presented focus fusion at google techtalks raising public awareness of our work lpp began to develop a sophisticated computer simulation aimed at understanding the formation of the plasmoids in the dense plasma focus reactor in detail this work is being carried out in collaboration with dr john guillory professor emeritus at george mason university and dr david rose of voss scientific inc – lpp initiated its planned twoyear experiment after receiving  million from private investors and the abell foundationus patent office issued patent  “method and apparatus for producing xrays ion beams and nuclear fusion energy” to eric j lerner and aaron blake with the assignment of the patent to lawrenceville plasma physics inclpp moved into its new office where the equipment was assemblederic lerner and the research team

our calculations showing that ignition and net energy gain can be achieved with pb hydrogenboron fuel the key to obtaining aneutronic fusion energy “according to the results of this paper”  they concluded ” it could be said that pb fuelled plasma focus device is a clean and efficient source of energy”december  issue of ieee transaction on plasma science m krishnan in a broad survey of the plasma focus field cited the use of a smaller anode to obtain higher fusion yield “the recent work of lerner et alour jofe paper used a smaller anode at much higher pressure and so it is no surprise that his neutron outputs are higher than those measured on pfthe world’s most powerful plasma focus device in warsaw”a new paper in physics of plasma has been cited by p kubes et al in plasma physics

funding but now lost it quickly jump on the “suppression claim” just as those who never found any money do too could it be that catherine austin fitts was correct that the entire system is a conspiracy and anyone who just loses former funding should really be thankful they still have their lives anyone who has actually faced the business end of a glock or ak i know  would gladly settle for funding loss over the next level of suppression while i continue my own soap box of wanting to see more rd money to small guys with good ideas the academics who burn up millions with nothing to show for it need to show some responsibility too if they got major money yet delivered nothing maybe they should admit it was just a bad idea not worth chasing too alpcns  a very interesting technology indeed i’ve been following these guys for a while and i think it looks promising especially since hydrogen and boron are both harmless and no serious harmful radiation is produced the fact that one can safely enter the reactor seconds after it has been turned off is extremely impressive i think it looks promising but i’m no expert in this field bob norman i think this approach makes way more sense than the big iter approach i think it will eventually produce energy but i’m skeptical the efficiencies will make it viable i think the whole hot fusion efforts will eventually die if for no other reason than the grid went away and a big power generator is no longer relevant in a world dominated by wind solar and whatever else comes tr m once storage is figured out batteries or ultracaps and cheep then the intermittent sources become a lot more viable i conserve with the best of them but the majority of my utility bills are connection fees etc you only really get a killer
