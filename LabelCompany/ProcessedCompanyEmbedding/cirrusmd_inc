texas risks and benefits of telemedicinein texas telemedicine involves a health care provider’s medical care delivered to patients physically located at sites other than where the provider is located with the use of technology that allows the provider to communicate with and see and hear the patients in real timethe benefits of telemedicine can include access to consultation and initiation of medical care at a time and place that is more convenient and efficient for the patient with the understanding that it does not replace an inperson encounter with a medical professional  treatment and consultation recommendations made via telemedicine are held to the same standards of acceptable medical practices as those made in the traditional inperson clinical settingsthe risks of telemedicine relate to the physical separation between health care provider and patient a telemedicine exam is not a complete physical exam as would normally take place in person telemedicine is further limited by its dependence on the use of technology to allow communication between the health care provider and patientfor residents of texas notice concerning complaintscomplaints about physicians as well as

delivered to patients physically located at sites other than where the provider is located with the use of technology that allows the provider to communicate with and see and hear the patients in real timethe benefits of telemedicine can include access to consultation and initiation of medical care at a time and place that is more convenient and efficient for the patient with the understanding that it does not replace an inperson encounter with a medical professional  treatment and consultation recommendations made via telemedicine are held to the same standards of acceptable medical practices as those made in the traditional inperson clinical settingsthe risks of telemedicine relate to the physical separation between health care provider and patient a telemedicine exam is not a complete physical exam as would normally take place in person telemedicine is further limited by its dependence on the use of technology to allow communication between the health care provider and patientfor
