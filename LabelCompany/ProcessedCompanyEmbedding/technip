the emergence of new concepts in offshore field development flexible pipe manufacturing plants with almost  of the market technip is the world leader in the design and manufacturing of flexible pipe with its manufacturing units located in france and in brazil the group is the leader in providing flexible pipe for oil and gas field developments thermoplastic sheaths ensure leakproofness and significantly reduce heat loss providing the best solution for corrosion resistance and for high temperature hydrocarbons helically wound the still wires give the structure an excellent bending performance these layers can be easily adapted to any subsea developments moreover flexible pipe can be easily retrieved in order to be reused on another field development particularly in brazil or in case of decommissioning in the british sector of the north sea  france le trait manufacturing plant brazil vitória manufacturing plant ipb technology technip has developed the integrated production bundle ipb an innovative and proprietary technology the ipb allows for highlevel flow assurance of hydrocarbon fluids in difficult conditions viscous oil deepwater pressure constraints etc from well heads to surface treatment units the ipb is a flexible production riser including thermal insulation layers additional hoses for gas lift or other services active heating through electric cables and fluid temperature monitoring with optical fibres the ipb technology was first and successfully deployed on the dalia field offshore angola for total at a water depth between  and m first oil of the dalia fpso occurred in december  technologies and products  flexible pipe  mb   rigid pipe scrhcr technip has developed reeled steel catenary risers and hybrid catenary risers which combine flexible and rigid pipe these technologies provide costeffective solutions for offshore field developments in certain layouts of deepwater environmentsthese lines can be laid using the group’s vessels apache or deep bluetechnip has successfully installed scr lines with the reel lay method our onshore welding of scrs for reel lay purposes allows to reach very high quality and therefore optimal fatigue performance the jlay method is used for large diameter pipes or very high top tensions pipeinpipe technology this technology integrates perfectly into these rigid pipe solutions providing the level of insulation necessary for economical installation and the level of flow assurance needed for effective production in deep and ultradeep water umbilicals through the technip umbilical systems tus group

what people thought was required and what actually was required in order to meet our customer service levels” tony bestall silvergate plastics view all testimonials planning and scheduling at technip  flexifrance december  back to all case studies  about the technip group  world leader in the fields of engineering and technical projects for the oil and gas for over  years   people in  countries  nationalities and industrial activities on  continents  billion euros of sales in  the markets of technip  • subsea the subsea market represents  of the turnover of technip in this activity are grouped underwater products and supplies pipes underwater flexible and rigid umbilicals and risers products for connecting subsea equipment to fixed platforms or floating production systems five manufacturing plants representing approximately  people in the production of hoses and umbilicals five assembly bases of rigid underwater pipes a fconstantly evolving fleet of support vessels • offshore the offshore market accounts for  of sales turnover for the group it develops methods for the manufacture and installation of fixed platforms for shallow waters and also floating platforms   • onshore this is the most important activity in the group which accounts for  of income it concerns the refining units hydrogen processing and settlement of gas and unconventional resources manufacture  technip has six manufacturing plants the factories in le trait france vitoria brazil and tanjung langsat malaysia are specialized in the manufacture of the flexible devices those in newcastle uk channelview us and lobito angola are focused on the production of umbilicals the resources are mainly based in europe but there is also a strong presence in south america and increasingly in asia product quality is fundamental to technip there are huge financial consequences at stake if equipment is unreliable their customer’s oil delivery are dependent on technip’s equipment both umbilicals and flexibles project value can be more than m€ in the north sea up to more than  billion € in south africa the group has a fleet of  ships to deliver and install their equipment the asiaflex factory is currently under construction where both flexible and umbilical products will be made the manufacture of flexibles at flexi france  this plant is located in le trait normandy and has been involved in the design and manufacture of flexible devices for more than  years it is the ‘centre of excellence’ for manufacturing the group has established a crossfunctional organization to respond to any request from customer prospecting to product realization flexi france figures  people  production staff  in r  d  offshore more than  km of flexible pipe and  connectors produced since  approximately  projects per year  different structures  endings  flexible devices all fabrications are madetoorder there is no standard product a flexible device carries oil and gas and consists of several layers each with a specific function  st layer  a stapled foliage that prevents the hose from closing on itself nd layer  thin plastic sealing rd layer  layer of steel to withstand the internal pressure th layer  crossply armor to provide stability over time ht layer  layer of protection and insulation to maintain temperature planning at flexi france as each project is almost unique the design of the equipment is systematically adapted to customer requirements depending on the depth at which the flexible device will be installed the fluid that will be carried the variation in the temperature of the water  the installation conditions the pressure the corrosive conditions  and the diameter which will be necessary to carry the fluid   production at the heart of the supply chain in  to meet its ambitions the technip group decided to focus on delivery reliability they wanted to be able to simulate the expected lead times of projects which could take between  months and  years and then monitor progress to meet customers deadlines “production is at the heart of the global supply chain group we must be able to announce accurate and reliable deadlines to customers and make simulations for future customers on a period stretching to three years the equipment must absolutely leave on the promise date as ships that are used to convey them to the platforms are reserved well in advance the cost of layingup a ship is very expensive and any delay in production would involve heavy additional costs which we have to avoid” says bruno bellet director of the factory at le trait the constraints • manage raw material suppliers the  principle suppliers to technip  are specifically qualified for each product purchases of raw materials are made as and when required by demand any supply risks are indentified in advance estimates of future demand are regularly sent to the suppliers estimates of future volumes to suppliers allow negotions to optimize • managing the entire chain of subcontracting forging machining welding protection a plan is sent to subcontractors about once per year revisions are done every  or  months the subcontractor is part of a project and therefore forward visibility is equally important to them to provide an efficient service • machine utilization the wide range of products and projects means that machine bottlenecks will often move over time depending on product mix • operator utilization it is necessary to change the number of operators  staff and the tasks assigned to them especially for example when specific equipment is needed such as reels to wind and store flexible devices it is necessary to be able to adjust the number of temporary staff easily the choice of equipment to use during manufacture will also change the operator requirements • reelbobbin utilisation it is necessary to manage the problem of the availability of reelsbobbins as well as the space available for storage a reelbobbin can weigh  tons therefore it is necessary to plan and take into account the handling equipment and movement of each reel • existing constraints detailed constraints intermachine conflicts reels are between  and  meters high some areas are not able to accept the reels so processes requiring certain sizes of reel have to be done in specific workshops machines can be single or multiprocess there are single and multiprocesses that can be parallel or linear  certain operations are connected others not all customer inspectors are present on site they impose inspection requirements at certain stages of manufacture requirements are dependent on whether the project is focussed on maintenance or new work management of production progress and history is important   estimated time for prototypes  to  of resource activity is dedicated to the realization of prototypes   manage other resources or other criteria management of non conformities on operations around  per week managing indexing complexity by operation management of diversity the makespans are long replanning and regrouping of work is necessary optimizing launches tools important makeready time requirements up to  hours consumable requirements adhesives oil etc manage financial forecasts technip wishes at a time t the progress of its projects in order to reliably simultaneously announce a projected budget the simulation will then be combined financial recovery for the group to make a forecast of consolidated sales planning is therefore a determining factor why a new solution for planning  scheduling  pioneer in the use of the optimization of the logistic chain technip had tried another solution a year before this solution had important limitations and did not take into account the whole of the manufacturing process it became imperative to improve this solution or change it “our tool for long term planning was a house dating from ” declared jerome delahaye responsable for planning at flexi france “it was limited to the manufacture of the flexible devices it did not manage the activities of the assembly of the ends test and packing we in addition had another solution which managed short term planning supplied with other technical data” the technical data were thus present in several tools we did not have commonality of data between these tools comments bruno bellet the solution did not take into account inventory control this needed to take into account the information from the erp to align the work orders with the available stock the high cost of maintaining existing tools was also a big factor in technip deciding to look for a new solution   conclusion an integrated solution was essential this solution would have to manage the total supply chain short term and long term it would have to take into account all detailed constraints of the workshops and the complexity of the processes it must be flexible and reactive it must be multiuser allow each user to make simulations allow filtering of information compare actual information with planned activities and be able to adapt to the increasing complexity of the products the decision to order preactor was taken in  and it is now operational at le trait in the uk in brazil and malaysia this is just part of a complete overhaul of the information systems in technip including erp during installation preactor  planning and scheduling chameleon  quotation configurator for the generation of estimates ennov  quality management other applications developed by technip the specifications for the planning  scheduling was pushed up voluntarily to measure the solutions ability to meet the requirements of technip  criteria have been identified since the solutions ability to meet business requirements taking into account all the constraints simulate etc  the preactor project started in december  preactor has considered  of the  criteria knowing that the remaining two criteria have been abandoned by technip meantime preactor covers  of the needs of technip this project has been successful   key factors of success by technip  the functional specification generated was very thorough and detailed including the integration with other technip applications the capital requirement and return on investment was based on technip being able to carry out simulations that enabled reliable delivery dates to be given to potential customers the project was carried out by all affected teams in the group from management to planning as well as production line teams the planning is the lifeblood of the group one project leader who was also responsible for functional requirements good control of the integration of all information systems at flexi france excellent interaction between the presales teams of both segula and preactor who were part of the implementation team the availability of a proof of concept solution before the final decision was made the international presence of preactor regular meetings with preactor international hq results  between  and  the sales turnover of technip was multiplied by  machine utilisation increased by  on a quarterly basis purchasing time has been halved enrollment increased by almost a third but its provision is now controlled in  years technip has increased its turnover threefold and has been able to meet its customer deadlines flexi france is now positioned on fast tracks orders with short times the resources are managed in detail equipment reels etc… the planning department is now able to anticipate problems before they occur a very strong “planning” culture is now at the centre of the organization plans are generated in ten seconds where it took several hours previously at a preliminary meeting every morning which allows the teams to concentrate on other tasks this time advantage allows the planners to now concentrate on the activity “win it” “this project was a true inhouse success the personnel now realize the power of preactor we chose to initially implement planning before the erp which shows our strong planning culture”  bruno bellet   siemens product lifecycle management software inc tel      sales  salespreactorcom  support

hydrogen for clean fuels production april   lehigh valley patwo decades of operational excellence and success were celebrated by air products nyse apd and technip nyse fr to mark the  year milestone of the longest and most productive global hydrogen alliance supporting the oil and gas industry around the world the global alliance was formed to meet refining industry demands for outsourced hydrogen to make cleaner burning transportations fuels during two decades air products and technip have constructed  steam methane reformer smr hydrogen production plants located in  countries the combined facilities provide the refining and petrochemical industry with more than two billion standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen the global alliance began in  when a paradigm shift in the refining industry began to gain momentum and the industry moved toward outsourcing and buying hydrogen instead of refiners making it on their own the success in meeting customer hydrogen demands for supply reliability and plant efficiency across the alliance’s first  years led to renewal of the agreement between air products and technip in  extending the relationship beyond the year  “this alliance helped lead the global refining industry’s major shift in decisionmaking to purchase hydrogen from a thirdparty instead of making its own outsourced hydrogen is supplied to our customers on a  basis in tonnage quantities and is a critical requirement for refineries to meet clean fuels standards we are very proud to have been working sidebyside with technip on several continents to help our customers meet the world’s growing energy needs in the most reliable efficient and sustainable manner” said john e mcglade chairman president and ceo of air products thierry pilenko technip’s chairman and ceo stated “technip is really proud to be a member of this alliance the valuable feedback we have received from the plants designed for air products coupled with technip’s high standards in design and engineering have improved long term operations where reliability over the years is the main focus in the end the refining industry benefits by receiving a reliable and costeffective source of hydrogen in addition our global footprint ensures that technip can accompany its clients around the world on their projects of tomorrow” throughout the global alliance relationship the two companies have continued to strive for productivity improvements supporting sustainability goals of reducing energy consumption and emissions one of the notable recent plant onstream sustainability successes of the alliance is located in rotterdam the netherlands the new hydrogen facility brought onstream in  improved energy efficiency over the previous hydrogen supply by over  percent it also lowered carbon
