income and growth fund xx limited partnership aei net lease xx and aei real estate fund xvi limited partnership aei real estate xvi are organized as limited partnerships domiciled in minnesota� in both limited partnerships corporations function as general partners robert p johnson is president of the corporations ����������� during the mids both appellant and her thenhusband anthony r alvarez were officers and shareholders in renaissant development corporation rdc a texas corporation that operated various texas restaurant chains�� ����������� respondents owned several texas properties� on november   anthony alvarez in his capacity as president of rdc entered into a lease agreement with aei net lease xx whereby rdc would become lessee of one of aeis texas properties� that same day both anthony alvarez and appellant signed a guarantee of lease� the document stated that the undersigned    hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to said lessor    the due and prompt performance and observance of all of the obligations of said lease to be met by lessee including but not limited to the payment of rent and other payments to be made under the lease   the document also contained the following clause this guarantee is executed under and intended to be construed by the laws of the state of minnesota� the undersigned consents to be sued in the jurisdiction and venue of any district court in the state of minnesota or in any court in the state of texas such jurisdiction and venue to be determined at the sole option and election of lessor   the document was signed by anthony alvarez in his capacity as president of an entity called the harvard associates inc� it was also signed by both anthony alvarez and appellant apparently individually ����������� on august   anthony alvarez in his capacity as president of rdc leased another texas property owned by aei net lease xx� again anthony alvarez and appellant signed a document containing language nearly identical to that found in the  guarantee� ����������� finally on march   anthony alvarez in his capacity of president of rdc leased a third texas property this time from aei real estate xvi� anthony alvarez in his capacity as president of the harvard associates inc and as president of various other corporations signed a guarantee with terms almost identical to the aforementioned guarantees� both anthony alvarez and appellant also signed the guarantee in their respective individual capacities� in  anthony alvarez and appellant reached a divorce agreement whereby anthony alvarez was to retain sole control over the rdc restaurant businesses� ����������� in august  respondents filed a complaint in ramsey county district court against among others the harvard associates inc anthony alvarez and appellant� respondents alleged that rdc had failed to pay rent under all three of the foregoing lease agreements and that the defendants were liable for the resulting damages pursuant to the guarantor agreements ����������� appellant moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over her� in support of this motion appellant submitted an affidavit in which she alleged that she had little or no involvement with rdc operations� rather according to appellant she merely signed documents that anthony alvarez had placed in front of her from time to time� appellant argued that this lack of knowledge concerning the forumselection clauses contained in the guarantor agreements coupled with the inconvenience that would result to her in minnesota litigation justified dismissal of the complaint� appellant acknowledged that she signed all three documents purporting to make her a guarantor of the lease agreements� johnson claims that appellant did in fact have some contact with respondents offices in the mids concerning the guarantor agreements appellant denies this claim� ����������� the district court denied appellants motion to dismiss finding that enforcing the forumselection clauses contained in the guarantor agreements was neither unfair nor unreasonable� the district court noted that while appellant may have been unsophisticated in business matters it is clear that her husband was not and that when mr alvarez negotiated these guarantor agreements he was doing so as agent of the corporations and of his wife� the district court concluded the bottom line is that on her husbands advice appellant voluntarily signed agreements which she chose of her own free will not to read or familiarize herself with and she did so for the benefit of her and her husband� under these circumstances the court is satisfied that there is nothing unfair about requiring appellant to defend this case in minnesota   this appeal followed����������� d e c i s i o n   enforcement of a forumselection clause is within the discretion of the district court� personalized mktg serv inc v stotler  co  nwd   minn app  review denied minn jan  � the district courts decision should not be disturbed unless the forumselection clause is so unreasonable that its enforcement would be clearly erroneous and against both logic and the facts on record� id at  citation omitted� ����������� when parties contractually agree to a forumselection clause that agreement should be given effect unless the party seeking to avoid the agreement can show that to do so would be unfair or unreasonable� hauenstein  bermeister inc v metfab indus  nwd   minn � enforcement of a forumselection clause is unfair or unreasonable only if�  the chosen forum is a seriously inconvenient place for trial  the choice of forum agreement is one of adhesion or  the agreement is otherwise unreasonable� interfund corp v obyrne  nwd   minn app � appellant contends that the district court abused its discretion in enforcing the forumselection clauses at issue because the three enumerated situations apply �������� seriously inconvenient forum appellant claims that minnesota is a seriously inconvenient forum as applied to her because she and her family reside in texas and defending a lawsuit in minnesota would disrupt the lives of her and her children in order for a forum to be seriously inconvenient one party would have to be effectively deprived of a meaningful day in court� the bremen v zapata offshore co  us    s ct    quoted in hauenstein  nwd at � factors relating to the location and convenience of witnesses generally do not enter the analysis in determining whether a forum is seriously inconvenient� hauenstein  nwd at � accordingly appellants discussion concerning the practical complications that might disrupt her life are irrelevant in determining whether to enforce the forumselection clauses at issue� moreover appellant has not demonstrated how enforcement of the forumselection clauses will deprive her of a meaningful day in court and therefore has failed to show that minnesota is a seriously inconvenient venue for trial �������� adhesion contracts appellant argues that the guarantor agreements at issue constitute contracts of adhesion by definition an adhesion contract is drafted unilaterally by a business enterprise and forced upon an unwilling and often unknowing public for services that cannot readily be obtained elsewhere� it is a contract generally not bargained for but which is imposed on the public for necessary service on a take it or leave it basis� even though a contract is on a printed form and offered on a take it or leave it basis those facts alone do not cause it to be an adhesion contract� there must be a showing that the parties were greatly disparate in bargaining power that there was no opportunity for negotiation and that the services could not be obtained elsewhere   schlobohm v spa petite inc  nwd   minn  citations omitted emphases in original� accordingly the two essential inquiries for determining whether a contract is one of adhesion are�  whether the contract the result of the superior bargaining power of one of the parties and  whether the contractual service involved a public necessity� osgood v medical inc  nwd   n minn app  review denied minn feb   appellant acknowledges that she signed the guarantor agreements at issue even though she did not know what the agreements bound her to do� despite appellants claims that she had little knowledge concerning her husbands business affairs she could have been in a fair bargaining position had she taken the time to read what she was signing rather than blindly following her former husbands advice or instructions� see cell v moore  schley sec corp  nwd   minn  no adhesion contract where although party claimed to be unsophisticated there is no indication that he was forced to enter into the agreement or was completely unable to negotiate its terms� moreover there is no evidence that appellant signed the guarantor agreements as a result of respondents� superior bargaining power� on this ground alone the guarantor agreements cannot be considered to be adhesion contracts� see id finally the guarantor agreements involved a guaranty by appellant her former husband and others as a means of inducing respondents to lease certain properties to rdc� appellant acknowledges she was an officer and shareholder of rdc� under the circumstances of the present case this type of agreement cannot be said to involve a public necessity as rdc presumably could have leased properties for its restaurants from any number of texas landowners� see schlobohm  nwd at  no adhesion contract where no showing that a partys services were necessary or that the services could not have been obtained elsewhere� in sum the guarantor agreements at issue do not display the indicia of adhesion contracts �������� otherwise unreasonable agreement appellant asserts that the terms of the guarantees were otherwise unreasonable� a forum selection clause is otherwise unreasonable if enforcement of the clause would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which the suit is brought� judicial economy and the prevention of multiple actions on similar issues are policies which can render a forum selection clause patently unreasonable   interfund  nwd at  citations omitted� here there is simply no evidence to explain how the enforcement of the forumselection clauses at issue would contravene a strong public policy because appellant has failed to show that the chosen forum is seriously inconvenient that the contracts at issue were adhesion contracts or that they were otherwise unreasonable we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in enforcing the forumselection clauses� affirmed  retired judge of the minnesota court of appeals serving by appointment pursuant to minn const art vi �     appellant claims that the district court erred as a matter of law by imputing the business knowledge of a husband to a wife and by imputing the knowledge of one corporate officer to another� based on the district courts order it is not clear that the district court made any such legal determination� on the contrary it appears that the district court was simply discussing anthony alvarezs business sophistication as one of many factors weighing against appellants assertion that the guarantor agreements constitute contracts of adhesion� at any rate the issue in the present case is whether the district court abused its discretion in enforcing the forumselection clauses not whether knowledge attribution from anthony alvarez to appellant is appropriate� we will not reverse a district courts decision based on an error�real or perceived�concerning what amounts to a collateral legal question� see in re welfare of dtn  nwd

or beliefs concerning future events including statements regarding anticipated application of cash expected returns from rental income growth in revenue the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses rates of distribution and other matters these and other forwardlooking statements should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the partnerships financial condition and results of operations including the following  market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate  the federal income tax consequences of rental income deductions gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the partners  resolution by the general partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted  the success of the general partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics  the effect of tenant defaults and  the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the partnership operate application of critical accounting policies the partnerships financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions these judgments will affect the reported amounts of the partnerships assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods it is possible that the carrying amount of the partnerships assets and liabilities or the results of reported operations will be affected if managements estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate management of the partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with managing partner of the partnership allocation of purchase price of acquired properties upon acquisition of real properties the partnership records them in the financial statements at cost not including acquisition expenses the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets consisting of land and building and to identified intangible assets and liabilities which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of inplace leases the allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value in many cases these values will be based upon managements assessment of each property the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset page  of  item  managements discussion and analysis continued the fair values of above market and below market inplace leases will be recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases measured over a period equal to the noncancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods the above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases including any bargain renewal periods if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration all unamortized amounts of above market and below market inplace lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income the fair values of inplace leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an inplace lease direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions tenant improvements and other direct costs and are estimated in part by managements consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease these direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases the value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease these intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration all unamortized amounts of inplace lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed the determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates rental growth rates discount and capitalization rates interest rates and other variables if managements estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price which could impact the amount of reported net income carrying value of properties the carrying value of the properties is initially recorded at cost not including acquisition expenses the partnership tests longlived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for properties the partnership will hold and operate management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the propertys probabilityweighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value for properties held for sale management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the propertys estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value if the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties page  of  item  managements discussion and analysis continued allocation of expenses aei fund management inc allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each funds affairs they also allocate expenses at the end of each month

management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations leases may contain rent increases based on the increase in the consumer price index over a specified period which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value however inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact

conditions the impact of conditions in the economy over the last few years including the turmoil in the credit markets has adversely affected many real estate investment funds however the absence of

r winn assistant state public defender  university ave se minneapolis mn  for appellant considered and decided by amundson presiding judge foley judge and thoreen judge u n p u b l i s h e d o p i n i o n foley judge stanley warren burch appeals his convictions for attempted firstdegree murder attempted seconddegree murder and assault in the first degree burch argues the district court erred by not allowing him to call an expert witness who would have testified generally about paranoid schizophrenia the victim was a paranoid schizophrenic but testified that she had not had any problems with her disease for nine years because she had been taking her medicine because we find no abuse of discretion we affirm facts on the evening of may   debra davenport was walking toward the  club on west broadway in minneapolis when she met stanley warren burch burch asked davenport if she wanted to walk to his place and then ride to the  club together in his car davenport agreed after they arrived at burchs house burch attacked davenport first by throwing a glass of drain cleaning solution containing  percent sulfuric acid onto her and then by punching her and cutting her with a knife davenport was seriously injured suffering second and thirddegree burns over  percent of her body at trial davenport testified that she suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that she was on medication for that condition burch then sought to call an expert witness dr alsdurf to testify about the effects of paranoid schizophrenia as well as about the possible interaction between crack cocaine and the medicine davenport was taking for her schizophrenia the district court denied burchs request the jury subsequently found burch guilty of attempted firstdegree murder in violation of minn stat §§     attempted seconddegree murder in violation of minn stat §§    and assault in the first degree in violation of minn stat §§    subd   burch appeals the district courts decision denying him the opportunity to call his expert d e c i s i o n the decision to admit the testimony of an expert witness will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion state v koskela  nwd   minn  in determining whether to admit expert testimony the ultimate question is whether the testimony will assist the jury in arriving at its verdict state v myers  nwd   minn  minn r evid  the district court should not admit evidence however even if it is relevant when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice myers  nwd at  minn r evid  burch sought to call dr alsdurf as an expert witness to testify about the symptoms suffered by an individual diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and about how the use of crack cocaine may interact adversely with the prescription medicine davenport was taking the district court refused to allow burch to call dr alsdurf stating based on the evidence adduced at trial thus far and the arguments presented by counsel at this particular point in time also based on the courts review of the medical records in camera which have been provided and which have been made available to both counsel in this case it appears at this time to the court that to allow the defendant to call dr alsdurf as an expert  expert witness would under the circumstances introduce evidence which might indeed mr mogelson be education and informative about the disease of paranoid schizophrenia in a broad sense however it is well taken that dr alsdurf would have no particular familiarity with this individual and this individuals case and i would note that the testimony from ms davenport herself ah was quite forthcoming in terms of her experience the length of her disease her various hospitalizations her medications and in fact in her response in crossexamination her awareness of many of the side effects of various things     the person who is on trial her is mr burch not ms davenport the issue before the court is whether or not mr burch assaulted miss davenport or attempted to murder her it is not whether or not miss davenport is a paranoid schizophrenic and as ive repeatedly said before on other issues we are not going to convert this into a trial of miss davenport and her paranoid  paranoid schizophrenia and particularly under the circumstances where there has been no specific offer of proof by the defense to date even as to what the theory of their defense is we believe the district courts ruling articulated the competing interests well and clearly indicated that the testimony in this case would have been repetitive and potentially prejudicial on these facts and in light of the offer of proof we cannot say the district court abused its discretion by refusing to allow burch to call dr alsdurf as an expert witness see bixler v state of minnesota  nwd  minn  stating that decision not to admit expert testimony will not be reversed absent clear error and that district courts have wide latitude to exclude repetitive and prejudicial evidence state v saldana  nwd   minn  once witness found competent to testify expert testimony concerning witnesss credibility or ability to distinguish truth from fantasy generally inadmissible burch filed a pro se brief in which he raises several issues after carefully reviewing burchs brief and the record we find no merit in any of burchs claims we therefore do not discuss them further  affirmed retired judge of the minnesota court of appeals serving by appointment pursuant to minn const art vi §  retired judge of the district court serving as judge of
