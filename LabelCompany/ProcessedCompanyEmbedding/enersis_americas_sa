outlook stable september    pm eastern daylight time chicagobusiness wirefitch ratings has affirmed enersis americas sas longterm foreign and local currency issuer default ratings idrs at bbb and longterm national scale rating at aacl the rating outlook is stable a complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release key rating drivers the ratings affirmation follows the companys recent announcement to proceed with a public acquisition of shares opa by its spanish acronym for all shares issued by endesa americas sa the opa expires on october  this is one of the last steps of the companys reorganization process that started last year and it is expected that the merger will be effective during  the ratings incorporate the assumption that enersis americas sas organizational structure will be simplified by merging the intermediary entities endesa americas sa and chilectra americas sa after the transaction has been completed endesa americas and chilectra americas shares will be exchanged for enersis americas shares the operation will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and incremental debt shareholders will have  days to exercise their withdrawal rights after enersis americas endesa americas and chilectra americas approve the merger during their respective extraordinary shareholder meetings today each of the entities approved the merger enersis americas endesa americas and chilectra americas shareholders deadline to exercise their withdrawal rights is oct   if shareholders exercising the withdrawal rights for enersis americas endesa americas and chilectra americas exceed   and  respectively the merger will not be formalized and the company may call for another shareholders meeting to submit the merger to a new vote fitch believes the future conclusion of the tender offer and merge of endesa americas sa and chilectra americas sa into enersis americas sa is neutral to the companys ratings enersis americas investment grade ratings reflect its solid business platform with a strong degree of business and geographic diversification and solid financialoperational metrics enersis americas operates in four countries in the generation transmission and distribution businesses yet is confronted by several economic challenges facing the region particularly in brazil rated bb outlook negative and argentina rated b outlook stable the risk of operating in lower rated sovereign environments is somewhat mitigated by the size of the exposure to these higher risk markets only  of the companys  pro forma ebitda excluding chile relates to noninvestment grade countries argentina and brazil and approximately  of the dividends paid to enersis americas relate to investment grade countries mainly colombia the stable outlook is driven by enersis americas adequate liquidity profile and credit metrics and the expectation that a balanced mix between generation and distributions businesses will be maintained credit risks associated with the company include potential pressures from the shareholder enel to promote any extraordinary dividends possible environmental andor political issues that could result in cost overruns or modifications of projects under construction although these risks appear manageable the ratings also consider the companys dependence on dividend payments from its subsidiaries to repay its own debt and incorporate the seasonal and regional cash flow volatility strong leverage metrics on a pro forma basis enersis americas maintains a strong capital structure with gross leverage defined as total debttoadjusted ebitda of x as of december  adjusted ebitda for  was usd billion versus usd billion in the predecessor company results slightly improved during the first half of  h with ebitda of approximately usd billion which was approximately  higher than h pro forma ebitda excluding the chilean operations argentina and brazil represented approximately  of the companys ebitda generation during the h improved results for  were supported by better results in the generation segment in the region coupled with better results in the distribution business for argentina and peru which partially offset the deteriorated results related of the brazilian distribution business fitch expects ebitda for  to be approximately usd billionusd billion and gross leverage measured as total debtebitda to remain below x moderate exposure to brazil fitch believes that after the spinoff and as a result of the companys decision to spinoff the chilean assets from the precedent enersis portfolio the volatility on the companys cash flow generation has moderately increased brazils economic downturn led to lower electricity demand and higher energy losses affecting the companys distribution results which was offset by the improved results in peru and argentina as of december  brazil and argentina represented approximately  of the companys ebitda fitch believes the companys exposure to argentina and brazil is mitigated by the companys solid cash flow generation from the remaining investment grade countries which comfortably covers its hard currency denominated debt service per fitchs criteria enersis americas applicable country ceiling is perus of a and the ratings are not constrained by the country ceiling of brazil manageable investment program fitch expects capex investment for  to amount approximately usd billion with  invested in distribution to mainly reduce losses which would improve the companys results fitch also believes the companys investment plan should not require additional significant indebtedness given the companys solid free cash flow generation during  the company invested usd million in generation on a pro forma basis excluding the chilean operations the main investments in generation during  were related to the construction of the hydro terminal el quimbo  mw in colombia which started operations on december  key assumptions fitchs key assumptions within the rating case for enersis americas include total production of    gwh on average per year average margins per mwh for generation during  of usd for argentina usd for brazil usd for colombia and usd for peru average margins per mwh for distribution during  of usd for argentina usd for brazil usd for colombia and usd for peru an average of usd billion of annual capex dividends  of net income rating sensitivities future developments that could individually or collectively lead to negative rating actions include a change in enersis americas power generation business commercial policy that results in an imbalanced longterm contractual position a material and sustained deterioration of credit metrics reflected in a debt to ebitda ratio greater than x and ebitda to interest coverage below x the deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions and respective sovereign ratings in the companys key markets a significant increase in enersis americas exposure to noninvestment grade countries a downgrade of brazils sovereign rating would not necessarily trigger a downgrade of enersis americas ratings considerations that could lead to a positive rating action rating or outlook include a material improvement in credit metrics that could be sustained over time a reduction in debt levels and higher earnings retention an improvement in the mix of cash flow generation towards higher credit quality markets would be viewed positively once the company establishes a longterm history of sustained gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratios under x level with a balanced geographical and business mix the companys credit ratings could be upgraded or the outlook revised to positive liquidity the companys liquidity continues to be solid on a pro forma basis the company has nearly usd billion of cash and equivalents as of june  and has available committed lines of credit totaling usd million this compares favorably with shortterm financial debt of usd million
