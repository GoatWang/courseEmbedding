court of oklahoma max smith dba smith oil appellant v marshall oil corporation appellee no      decided february   jack mattingly sr jack mattingly jr gary p snow mattingly snow  mattingly pc seminole ok for appellant james w george l mark walker crowe  dunlevy a professional corporation oklahoma city ok for appellee ¶  the dispositive issues on certiorari are whether the subject leases terminated under the terms of their habendum clauses and whether ownership of certain equipment left on the leased premises by appellant max smith dba smith oil vested in the surface owner   we answer these questions in the affirmativefacts and procedural history¶  the operator max smith dba smith oil acquired oil and gas leases for properties located in seminole county oklahoma  the relevant leases provide for a oneyear primary term   it is undisputed that smith obtained production from the stacy and paige wells during the primary term and that the leases were held by production into their secondary terms   the leases contain habendum clauses that provide for secondary terms “as long thereafter as oil or gas or either of them is produced from said land by the lessee”   an addendum to the lease dated november   towit  paragraph  of exhibit “a” to said lease between jw scott and alyce scott lessors and max smith dba smith oil lessee provides the following“ in the event of cessation of production on said loud land lessee agrees to remove all salvageable structures he then owns within six  months of cessation date weather permitting   failure of lessee to do so shall vest ownership of said equipment to the surface owner”¶  the trial court rendered judgment against smith in a quiet title action brought against marshall oil corporation appellee herein and a successor in interest to smith   the trial court held that the oil and gas leases expired under the terms of their habendum clauses and thus were no longer in force   the trial court also held that ownership of the structures and equipment smith placed on the leased premises vested in the surface owner under ¶  of the exhibit “a” addendum quoted hereinabove   the court of civil appeals division i in an opinion released for publication affirmed the judgment of the trial court   we granted certiorari¶  appellant smith acquired a working interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate known as the stacypaige lease pursuant to the abovementioned leases covering the south half of the northeast quarter of section  township  north range  east in seminole county oklahoma   smith acquired the prior leasehold estate by sheriffs deed dated november   and filed december    it is undisputed that smith obtained production on stacypaige lease during the primary term   it also is undisputed that this production continued in commercial quantities for several years into the secondary term   however the parties disagree as to whether or not the subject wells were at all times capable of producing in paying quantities during the secondary term   indeed this was a factual issue before the trial court ¶  marshall oils predecessors west consulting company inc and energy lease brokers inc purchased new oil and gas leases that covered the same properties as smiths old leases on october   january   and april     they entered the premises and took possession of the stacy and paige wells   in february  they topleased the properties to marshall oil marshall oil is successor in title to the rights in the top leases pursuant to an assignment dated february   but with the effective date of november     no party argues that the top leases grant a reversionary interest independent of the adjudication of the base leases¶  it is undisputed that the mineral owner lessor never made a verbal or written demand on smith to comply with the implied covenant to market oil or gas from the wells and did not give smith reasonable time to comply with any such demand   it also is undisputed that the mineral owner lessor never brought an action to declare a forfeiture of the lease   smith contends that the instant action arises from a claim of breach of the implied duty to market oil and gas   as such he reasons that a demand must be made and time granted with which to comply prior to commencement of an action against him   marshall oil argues that the quiet title action before us is premised upon the theory that the stacypaige lease expired under the terms contained in the habendum clause and as such no demand or time with which to comply was necessary to prevent a forfeiture of smiths estate in the leasehold¶  this action to quiet title was tried on august     marshall oil moved for a directed verdict that the trial court granted finding smiths oil and gas leases expired by their own terms   the trial court denied smiths motion for new trial and he appealed   the court of civil appeals division i affirmed the decision of the trial court in an opinion released for publication   on certiorari granted upon smiths petition we now vacate the court of civil appeals opinion and sustain the judgment of the trial court for the reasons set forth hereinbelowstandard of review ¶  the instant matter is an action to cancel an oil and gas lease   as such it is one of equitable cognizance  hininger v kaiser  ok   pd    the trial courts decision will not be reversed unless we find that it is clearly against the weight of the evidence  hamilton v amwar petroleum co  ok   pd impact of language in habendum clause ¶  in the state of oklahoma when the term “produced” is used in a “thereafter” provision of an habendum clause its meaning is that of “production in paying quantities”  stewart v amerada hess corp  ok  ¶   pd    barby v singer  ok  ¶   pd    pack v santa fe minerals  ok  ¶   pd     “production in paying quantities” is a term defined by oklahoma case law to mean “production of quantities of oil and gas sufficient to yield a profit to the lessee over operating expenses even though the drilling costs or equipping costs are never recovered and even if the undertaking as a whole may result in a loss to the lessee”  hininger v kaiser  ok  ¶   pd     the phrase denotes a return in excess of “lifting expenses” costs associated with lifting the oil from the ground after the well has been drilled  stewart v amerada hess corp  ok  ¶   pd    the record in this case establishes that during the secondary term of the stacypaige lease the subject wells ceased production at some times while at other times they produced but not in paying quantities¶  smith in his reply brief contends that danne v texaco exploration and production inc  ok civ app   pd  holding texaco forfeited its lease for breach of the implied covenant to market during its secondary term controls the instant matter and should result in an opinion in his favor   we disagree  danne is distinguishable on its facts as well as one of its legal theoriesa claim that the lessee breached the implied covenant to market the product with due diligence   the instant matter is not a claim for breach of the implied covenant to market the product   it is a claim to quiet title under the theory that smiths leases expired under their own terms contained in the habendum clause   if the evidence herein demonstrates that the subject wells were not producing in paying quantities and that smith failed to present compelling equitable considerations to justify this failure to produce in paying quantities then a decree of lease cancellation may be rendered   see eg pack v santa fe minerals  ok  ¶   pd   quoting stewart v amerada hess corp  ok  ¶   pd   equitable considerations¶  we first conclude that the period employed by the trial court in the instant case to measure the stacy and paige wells profitability was sufficient under all the facts and circumstances for a fair and reasonable determination   since the stacy and paige wells commenced in the primary terms of the subject leases the question then becomes whether the period of cessation of production and of failure to produce in paying quantities is reasonable as well as the question of smiths diligence as operator   voluntariness of the cessation is another factor to consider  hunter v clarkson  ok  ¶   pd    kerr v hillenberg  ok  ¶   pd     the cessation of production herein was not due to mechanical difficulties nor was it involuntary   by smiths own testimony he turned the wells on when he wanted to and turned them off when he wanted to  ¶  in determining whether a failure to produce in paying quantities suffices to terminate a lease we examine the facts and circumstances of the cessation on a casebycase basis  barby v singer  ok  ¶   pd    stewart v amerada hess corp  ok  ¶   pd     indeed we have held that “compelling equitable considerations” may save a lease from termination even with unprofitable well operations   barby ¶   pd at  prospect of impending federal legislation the natural gas policy act that might result in an increase in the price of natural gas was equitable consideration  state ex rel commissioners of the land office v carter oil co of west virginia  ok  ¶¶    pd   an implied covenant case in which the fact that lessees were unable to market product due to absence of pipeline in which to transport product was equitable consideration  cotner v warren  ok  ¶¶   pd  an implied covenant case wherein we held that five to six months of voluntary cessation of marketing where operator was attempting to resolve partnership differences during the time period was equitable consideration  hunter v clarkson  ok  ¶   pd   an implied covenant case in which we held that a five month cessation of production and marketing without any circumstances to justify cessation was not equitable consideration and resulted in lease cancellation¶  smith relies heavily on our decision in pack v santa fe minerals  ok   pd    however in the pack case the parties stipulated that the subject wells were at all times capable of producing in paying quantities   in the case at bar marshall oil contends that the stacy and paige wells were not capable of producing in paying quantities in the condition they were in at the time immediately prior to the time marshall oil took possession and reworked the wells   in the absence of compelling equitable considerations to justify smiths failure to produce in paying quantities the leases will terminate under the terms of the habendum clauses   the trial court concluded that a dearth of equitable considerations existed in the instant matter   on review we must consider whether the trial courts conclusion is clearly against the weight of the evidence¶  the evidence produced at trial establishes that the two leases in question failed to yield a return in excess of lifting expenses during years  through   the evidence at trial supports a finding that the gross value of such production was approximately   evidence established smiths lifting costs for this period were in excess of   these lifting costs include saltwater disposal payments to landowner scott annual electric costs gross production taxes    royalty payments to royalty owners and depreciation  the leases took in revenue of approximately ¶  smith testified at trial regarding this time period as follows  “i produced them when i felt like producing them   and i turned them off when i felt like turning them off”   this conduct is unacceptable for an operator in the state of oklahoma where the landowner is protected when an operator ceases production for an unreasonable time without cause after the primary term expires   we stated in hunter v clarkson  ok  ¶   pd   that“the operator cannot ․ only produce oil when it suits his purposes   the landowner has an interest which must and will be protected when the operator ceases production for an unreasonable time without cause after the expiration of the primary term”the facts in hunter were disputed but ultimately they revealed a voluntary cessation of production without any circumstances to justify a continuation of the lease¶  the record supports the trial courts determination that while smith produced these leases in their secondary terms the production was not profitable for three years   at this juncture all production ceased   no further production occurred until april  when marshall oils predecessor commenced operations under the new leases   smith quit using electricity in january    his production records reflect that he terminated production at this time   smith offered no compelling equitable concerns to justify this   instead smith testified he deliberately ceased production hoping oil and gas prices would rise   however he had no factual support for this and testified it was his mere “hope”   ¶  smith also testified he did not want to produce the wells when prices of oil dropped to  a barrel and that he decided to wait until they rose to  a barrel   however the evidence presented shows that he sold oil for  per barrel on january    a barrel on january   and  per barrel on february    fluctuating market prices do not rise to the level of an equitable consideration or an excuse for smiths failure to produce in paying quantities   while smith contends that a gas purchase statement was addressed to him from enerfin resources one lp for gas production dated february  this gas was produced by marshall oils predecessor not smith   marshall oils predecessor changed billing for the gas meters in january  according to the evidence presented at trial   this was well over a year before this gas statement making it a physical impossibility that smith produced gas in february of    smith admitted this at trial ¶  the evidence supports the trial courts finding that no extenuating circumstances occurred that would justify smiths failure to produce in paying quantities for these years and that the leases expired by the terms of their own habendum clauses   smith continues to argue that they were at all times capable of producing in paying quantities thus satisfying the habendum clauses of the leases   the trier of fact found to the contrary based upon the evidence presented at the trial of this matter and upon appellate review we cannot say that this finding was contrary to the clear weight of the evidence   smith failed to produce any evidence to support his assertion that the wells were at all times capable of producing in paying quantities other than his personal belief to that effect   the record establishes that smiths lifting expenses which by his own admission understate his actual costs due to insufficient recordkeeping far exceed any return when the wells actually were producing   evidence as to how this scenario could change visàvis a scenario in which the wells might be merely “capable of producing” was never presented by smith   as stated hereinabove smiths argument as to a breach of an implied duty to market is inapplicable to the instant facts   none of the cases cited by smith involve the evidence in this case   he cannot under the terms of his leases only produce oil andor gas when it suits his purposes   the lessors have an interest that must be protected when smith as operator ceases production for an unreasonable time without cause or justifiable equitable considerations after the primary terms of the leases have expired¶  the remaining issue before us concerns the addendum to the november   lease towit  whether ownership of certain equipment left on the premises vested in the surface owner because smith failed to remove it   the record indicates that smith was primarily concerned with possession of the stacypaige lease as opposed to any specific equipment left on the premises   plaintiffsappellants trial exhibit  purports to be at least a partial list of smiths salvageable structures and equipment along with the values associated with each item left on the premises the ownership of which marshall oil contends vested in the surface owner smith apparently did not maintain an equipment inventory for this lease   the handwritten list does not contain a total value   if we accept the values assigned by smith to the equipment he listed the value is    we note that smith wrote this list on the back of an oklahoma corporation commission division order for interests in hughes county oklahoma   in any event it would appear that if he were concerned with ownership of his equipment vesting in the surface owner he would have maintained an equipment inventory complete with values of equipment that could be substantiated with purchase and depreciation documentation   no such evidence is contained in the record before us ¶  overall smiths testimony reflects a lack of concern as to equipment ownership vesting in the surface owner   he testified that he did not remember whether the provision in the november   lease regarding ownership of equipment vesting in the surface owner was his idea or the lessors   he further testified it was agreed that if there were a cessation of production he had six months to recover his equipment   there was no confusion as to this provision or its application in the event of a cessation of production   the only dispute was as to whether a cessation of production actually occurred   smith testified he did not agree that there was a fifteen month cessation of production stating  “because i had proved i had produced the wells up to december of ′”  the record supports a finding that smith did not argue the provision providing equipment ownership would vest in the surface owner if not removed within six months was inapplicable   he merely argued that a cessation of production had not occurred   as such our determination the stacypaige lease ceased to produce in paying quantities indisputably triggered the sixmonth period for smith to remove his equipment   his failure do so during the first calendar year of failure to produce in paying quantities and the fact he left his equipment on the leased premises through calendar year  when his successors in interest took over supports a finding that ownership thereof vested in the surface owner under this express lease provision¶  smith testified he did not realize the leases had changed hands until a potential buyer called him and said that there were “some people out there using your equipment and trying to produce your well”   smith testified he “didnt do anything” even with this knowledge  instead of attempting to repossess his equipment smith did nothing   he sent an electric bill payment to canadian valley electric and received a phone call from them informing him the leases had been changed over to west consultant   the record establishes that this occurred in january    it is difficult to comprehend how smith could have been diligently reworking the subject wells or diligently attempting to produce them while remaining completely unaware that another entity had entered the premises had reworked or was in the process of reworking the wells and had changed over the electric billings¶  the record reveals that marshall oil was prepared to offer testimony as to the significant amount of money spent to rework the wells and return them to the capacity to produce in paying quantities once smiths successors in interest took over   counsel for marshall oil stated in his opening statement to the trial court that his client completely reworked the wells and installed new equipment spending in excess of over half a million dollars in reworking and reequipping the wells so that they would be able to produce in paying quantities   since the trial court granted a directed verdict at the end of appellants evidence it was unnecessary for appellee to call its witnesses who by all accounts would have so testified   nonetheless this fact alone suggests that the equipment smith left on the premises had little industry value   otherwise significant expenditures would not have been required and smith would have attempted to recover his equipment   the evidence in the record does not show any efforts by smith to recover the equipment he left on the leased premises at the time his successors in interest took over the leases or at any time prior or subsequent to that time   when asked what he would have to do to produce the wells if he were to take them over again smith testified he had “no idea” that he “didnt know what marshall oil had done”   evidence presented at trial established that while the wells were not producing under smiths operation from  forward they began to produce again after reworking by marshall oils predecessors   this is evidenced in the february  gas purchase statement of enerfin resources   previously referenced in ¶  hereinabove   since substantial reworking was required this lends credence to the belief that the value of smiths equipment was nominal at best   both smiths actions and inaction with regard to the equipment he left on the subject leases supports a determination that ownership vested in the surface owner under the specific lease provision but also that the equipment itself was of little or no value visàvis the subject leases   smith did not testify as to the salvage value of his equipment   the testimony was inadequate to support a conclusion that smiths equipment was valuable   in addition smith did not contend that inclement weather or any other condition or circumstance prevented him from removing his equipment during the allowed sixmonth periodconclusion¶  smith failed to present any equitable considerations to justify his failure to produce the stacypaige lease or to justify his failure to produce in paying quantities for the period of    in addition smith failed to produce any barrels of oil from the stacy and paige wells for the year  and failed to present any equitable considerations to justify his failure to produce in  as well   the evidence supports the trial courts rendering a directed verdict for marshall   we hold that the evidence is sufficiently substantial to sustain the findings and determinations of the trial court and to sustain its directed verdict in favor of marshall oil we hold that the evidence did not constitute compelling equitable circumstances that would justify the continuation of the subject leases in the face of a cessation of production and in the face of a cessation of production in paying quantities¶  smith failed to present any evidence at trial regarding inclement weather to preclude removal or any other variable for equitable consideration that might have precluded his removal of the structures equipment and fixtures within the six months following cessation of production as required under the exhibit a to this lease   therefore we hold that the weight of the evidence clearly supports the judgment of the trial court in this regard   since smith failed to remove the structures equipment and fixtures as required under the november   addendum to the lease ownership of same vested in the surface owner under the specific provisions of the lease¶  on certiorari granted upon smiths petition the court of civil appeals opinion is vacated  the judgment of the trial court is affirmedcertiorari previously granted  the
