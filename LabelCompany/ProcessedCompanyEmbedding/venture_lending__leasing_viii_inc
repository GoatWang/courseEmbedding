amounts paid by the fund or the company to acquire equity securities pursuant to the exercise of warrants received in connection with the fund’s venture loans shall not be taken into account in determining whether such  threshold has been met the fund will make available significant managerial assistance through its officers to certain companies whose securities are held in the fund’s portfolio as described under the caption “regulation”as a bdc the fund must invest at least  of its total assets in qualifying assets “qualifying assets” consisting of a interests in “eligible portfolio companies” as defined in the  act “eligible portfolio companies” and b certain other assets including cash and cash equivalents an eligible portfolio company is a united states company that is not an investment company as defined or excluded from the definition of investment company in section  of the  act and that either i does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or does have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non­voting common equity of less than  million; or ii is actively controlled by a bdc and has an affiliate of a bdc on the eligible portfolio company’s board of directors; or iii has total assets of not more than  million and capital and surplus of not less than  million; or iv meets such other criteria as may be established by the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” control under the  act is presumed to exist where a bdc owns more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the eligible portfolio company also included in qualifying assets are follow­on investments in a company that met the definition of eligible portfolio company at the time of the fund’s initial investment but subsequently does not meet such definition because it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange if at the time of the follow­on investment the fund a owns at least  of i the greatest number of equity securities of such company including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities and ii the greatest amount of certain debt securities of such company held by the fund at any time during the period when such company was an eligible portfolio company and b is one of the twenty largest holders of record of the company’s outstanding voting securities the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in non­qualifying assets including interests in companies that are not eligible portfolio companies for example because the company’s securities are quoted on the nasdaq global market “nasdaq” and eligible portfolio companies as to which the fund does not offer to make available significant managerial assistanceventure loans venture loans generally will be made pursuant to a negotiated loan agreement and be evidenced by promissory notes secured by specific equipment or other assets of the borrower financed with the proceeds of such loans or secured by a broader lien on substantially all of the borrower’s assets where the purpose of the loan is to provide growth or general working capital to the borrower the loans typically are secured by a first‑position lien on such assets the fund will receive periodic payments usually monthly and may receive a final payment equal to a percentage of the original loan amount payable at maturity of the legal loan whether as stated or accelerated the interest rate and amortization terms of venture loans and all other transaction terms will be individually negotiated between the fund and each borrowerthe documentation for venture loans will include representations warranties covenants and events of default intended to protect the fund and which are customary for commercial transactions of this type and size typical material terms include restrictions on additional debt covenants to maintain the collateral and keep it adequately insured and free of liens prohibitions against sale or other disposition of the assets except under specified conditions and acceleration provisions making the remaining outstanding amounts under the loan immediately due and payable and giving rise to a right to take possession of the collateral upon certain events of default including failure to make required payments insolvency and failure to comply with covenants there can be no assurance that the value of the collateral at the time of default will be at least equal to the outstanding amount due under the loantypically loans will be structured as commitments by the fund to provide financing in one or more advances over a specified period of availability determined during the underwriting process the commitment of the fund to finance future asset acquisitions or growth capital needs is typically subject to the absence of any default under the loan and compliance by the borrower with requirements relating to among other things the type of assets to be acquired and if applicable the borrower’s achievement of performancebased milestones although the fund’s commitment generally will provide that the fund is not required to continue to fund additional asset purchases or growth capital if there has been a material adverse change in the borrower’s financial condition a borrower’s financial condition may not be as strong at the time a loan is funded as it was when the related commitment was madewarrants in most cases the fund will acquire warrants to purchase equity securities of the borrower in connection with financings it is anticipated that such warrants generally will be distributed by the fund to the company simultaneously with or shortly following their acquisition the terms of the warrants including the expiration date exercise price and terms of the equity security for which the warrant may be exercised will be negotiated individually with each borrower and will likely be affected by the price and terms of securities issued by the company to its venture capitalists and other holders in equity financings close in time to the fund’s making of the loan commitment based upon the investment manager’s past experience it is anticipated that most warrants will be exercisable for a term of five to ten years and will have an exercise price based upon the price at which the borrower most recently issued equity securities or if a new equity offering is anticipated the future price of such equity securities and sometimes a “blended price” in certain transactions it is anticipated that warrants will be issued with an exercise price that is waived in connection with an initial public offering or acquisition the equity securities for which the warrant will be exercised generally will be convertible preferred stock of which there may be one or more classes or common stock substantially all the warrants and underlying equity securities will be restricted securities under the  act at the time of issuance; the fund generally negotiates registration rights with the borrower that may provide “piggyback” and s‑ registration rights which permit the owner of the warrant under certain circumstances to include some or all of the securities that will be acquired upon exercise of the warrant in a registration statement filed by the borrower the fund generally will negotiate “net issuance” provisions in the warrants which allow the owner of the warrant to exercise the warrant without payment of any cash and thereby receive a net amount of shares determined by the increase in the value of the issuer’s stock at the time of exercise above the exercise price stated in the warrantequity securities the fund and company also may make direct investments in equity securities having an aggregate cost of up to  of the aggregate cost of all investments of the fund and the company determined cumulatively over the life of the fund and the company provided however that any amounts paid by the fund or the company to acquire equity securities pursuant to the exercise of warrants received in connection with the fund’s venture loans shall not be taken into account in determining whether such  threshold has been met such direct investments generally will be in equity securities of borrowers legal in the fund’s portfolio although equity securities of other companies could also be purchased it is anticipated that such equity investments may be in connection with participating in an equity financing subsequent to making a loan for example the company may invest equity in a followon round of financing to maintain or increase its ownership stake in select cases investments may include companies where the fund does not have an existing loan additionally the fund and the company anticipate selectively pursuing opportunistic equity purchases which may take the form of secondary stock purchases the investment manager expects that the equity securities generally will be convertible preferred stock though it is possible the fund would invest directly in common stock of equity capital­backed companies or convertible notes which convert into common stock of equity backed companies it is likely that as in the case of warrants direct equity investments generally will be distributed by the fund to the company simultaneously with or shortly following their acquisition although in this case as a result of us federal income tax and  act requirements the equity investments may be held by the fund for a longer period of time prior to their distribution to the companyinvestment policiesfor purposes of these investment policies other than the diversification standards below references to the percentage of the fund’s total assets “invested” in securities of a company will be deemed to refer in the case of financings in which the fund commits to provide financing prior to funding the commitment to the value of the maximum amount of securities to be issued by the borrower to the fund pursuant to such commitment; the fund will not be required to divest securities in its portfolio or decline to fund an existing commitment because of a subsequent change in the value of securities the fund has previously acquired or committed to purchasediversification standards the fund will be classified as a “non­diversified” closed­end investment company under the  act until the fund qualifies as a regulated investment company “ric” it will not be subject to the diversification requirements applicable to rics under the internal revenue code commencing with the first capital call the investment manager will seek to increase the diversification of the fund’s portfolio so as to make it possible to meet the ric diversification requirements as described below there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to meet those requirementsto qualify as a ric the fund must meet the issuer diversification standards under the internal revenue code that require that at the close of each quarter of the fund’s taxable year i not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities of a single issuer and ii at least  of the value of its total assets is represented by cash cash items government securities securities of other rics and other securities counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed  of the value of the fund’s total assets and the fund does not own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securitiesindustry segment concentration the fund will seek to build a diversified portfolio by investing in a large number of technology companies across a broad range of industry segments representative segments may include enterprise software various veritical markets online consumer services healthcare medical devices biotechnology security technology and internetenabled businesses among others it is anticipated that the percentage of the fund’s investments within any particular segment will evolve over time as segments fall in and out of favor within the venture capital ecosysteminvestment guidelines in selecting investments for the fund’s portfolio the investment manager will endeavor to meet the investment guidelines as established by the fund’s board of directors the fund may however make investments that do not conform to one or more of these guidelines when deemed appropriate by the investment manager such investments might be made if the investment manager believes that a failure to conform in one area is offset by exceptional strength in another or is compensated for by a higher yield favorable warrant issuance or other attractive transaction terms or featureslegal stage of development guidelines the investment manager will seek to diversify the fund’s portfolio based on the development stage of the companies in which it invests generally venture­backed companies fall into several categories•early or seed stage companies represent the initial stages of a startup company’s development these companies have raised varying amounts of equity capital to prove a concept and qualify for larger sums of startup capital their activities are limited to product development scientific and market research recruiting a management team and proving early business traction these companies general have investor syndicates that include early state investors such as high net worth angel investors venture capitalists incubators and crowd funding platforms•emerging growth stage companies have proven early productmarket fit and have initiated or are about to initiate fullscale operations and sales but may not be showing a profit•mezzanine stage companies are approaching or have attained break even or profitability and are continuing to expand          the investment manager will refer to its investments in seed and start­up companies as “early stage” and investments in emerging growth companies and mezzanine companies as “expansion stage” the investment manager will see to diversify its investments across stages classification of a company by stage of development necessarily involves a subjective judgment by the investment manager and it is possible that other investors or market analysts would classify a company differently than the classification used by the fundquality guidelines the investment manager will seek to invest the majority of the fund’s aggregate investments determined cumulatively over the life of the fund in investments that meet the following criteriacompany guidelines•the company has a minimum capitalization of at least  million•the company has at least six months’ available cash to fund its operations or indications from its equity investors that they will make investments necessary to provide such cash•the company’s equity investors have indicated a current intention to make additional equity financing available to the company or the company has a forecasted positive cash flow•the company’s business plan contemplates sales of at least  million within five years•the company has previously closed equity financing or will close equity financing prior to the funding of the loan         transaction guidelines for loans•the term of the loan does not exceed  months and does not extend beyond december  •debt service requirements of the loan are in the opinion of the investment manager not likely to become an impediment to the company raising additional capital•the loan is securitized by all or substantially all of the assets of the borrowerequity capital support guidelines•the company’s equity investors have i in the opinion of the investment manager significant venture capital ecosystem experience and ii and followon capital to support the companylegal special situations the investment manager may invest up to  of the fund’s aggregate investments determined cumulatively over the life of the fund in special situation investments such special situations could include investments targeted towards latestage or public companies seeking additional growth capital to expand product offerings increase market penetration or fund strategic acquisitions of other companies or technology in these situations the fund would generally only consider investing in this special situation debt if it determined it to be of equivalent or better quality to a senior secured loan to the fund’s more typical portfolio companies further the fund may also choose to subordinate existing outstanding debt as part of a restructuring or workout arrangement in order to allow the company to successfully complete a transaction such as an acquisition or round of financing there can be no assurance that the subordination will work to the benefit of the fund the investment manager will target companies whose cash flow from operations and cash reserves are expected to service the fund’s investment on a current basis investments may be structured as senior debt convertible debt or other debtequity structures in addition special situations could include investments in a “troubled” company undergoing a restructuring or recapitalization of its existing debt or equity and making investments in subordinated debt providing bridge financing to a company which is in the process of raising additional private equity planning an initial public offering or is seeking to enter into a business combination through which it would be acquiredinternational investments as a bdc the fund may invest no more than  of its total assets in companies which are not “eligible portfolio companies” an “eligible portfolio company” must be organized under the laws of and have its principal place of business in the united states therefore the fund could invest up to but no more than  of its total assets in foreign based companies if reasonably practicable investments in foreign based companies would be secured by foreign based assets in addition to being secured by any assets located in the united statesleverage the fund intends to borrow money from and issue debt securities to banks insurance companies and other lenders to obtain additional funds to originate loans and possibly for special situation investments if such borrowings are available on terms that are acceptable to the investment manager and the board of directors of the fund it is possible due to the tightening of the credit markets that the fund may not be able to secure such borrowings on acceptable terms see the discussion at item a under the caption “risk factors – investment risks – crisis in financial markets” any borrowings of the fund will be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the  act see the discussion below under the caption “regulation” the use of leverage increases investment risk see the discussion at item a under the caption “risk factors – general – leverage”temporary investments pending investment and until distributions to the stockholders are made the fund and the company will invest excess cash in i time deposits certificates of deposit and similar instruments of highly­rated banks; ii securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities; iii repurchase agreements that are a issued by highly­rated banks or securities dealers; and b fully collateralized by us government securities; iv short­term high­quality debt instruments of us corporations; and v money market funds and other pooled investment funds whose investments are restricted to those described above the average maturity of such investments weighted by their par value will not exceed  daysother investment policies the fund will not sell securities short except to the extent the fund has a warrant for or owns shares equal to the number of shares which is the subject of the proposed short sale purchase securities on margin except to the extent the fund’s permitted borrowings are deemed to constitute margin purchases purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts except interest rate hedging transactions in connection with the fund’s permitted borrowings or purchase or sell real estate the fund may however write puts and calls and acquire options as a hedge for equity investments and to increase return through a covered call the fund will not underwrite the securities of other companies except to the legal extent it may be deemed an underwriter upon the disposition of restricted securities acquired in the ordinary course of its business the fund may however use borrowed funds for its lending activities see the discussion at item a under the caption “risk factors – general – leverage”the fund’s investment objectives investment policies and investment guidelines other than its status as a bdc are not fundamental policies and may be changed by the fund’s board of directors at any timeregulationafter filing an election to be treated as a bdc a company may not withdraw its election without first obtaining the approval of holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities

of disinterested directors; and vi file or under certain circumstances intend to file a proper notice of election with the sec“making available significant managerial assistance” is defined under the  act in relevant part as i an arrangement whereby the bdc through its officers directors employees or general partners offers to provide and if accepted does provide significant guidance and counsel concerning the management operations or business objectives of a portfolio company; or ii the exercise by a bdc of a controlling influence over the management or polices of the portfolio company by the bdc acting individually or as part of a group acting together which controls the portfolio company the officers of the fund and the officers of the investment manager on behalf of the fund intend to offer to provide managerial assistance including advice on equipment acquisition and financing cash flow and expense management general financing opportunities acquisition opportunities and opportunities to access the public securities markets to the great majority of companies to whom the fund provides venture loans the right to offer such assistance will typically be provided in the negotiated documents for the loan transactions in some instances officers of the fund might serve on the board of directors of borrowers or of companies in which it makes an equity investmentan “eligible portfolio company” is a domestic company with its principal place of business in the united states that is not an investment company as defined or excluded from the definition of an investment company in section  of the  act and that either i does not have a class of securities registered on a national securities exchange or does have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non­voting common equity of less than  million; or ii is actively controlled by a bdc and has an affiliate of a bdc on the eligible portfolio company’s board of directors; iii has total assets of not more than  million and capital and surplus of not more than  million; or iv meets such other criteria as may be established by the sec control under the  act is presumed to exist where a bdc owns more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the eligible portfolio companythe  act prohibits or restricts bdcs from investing in certain types of companies such as brokerage firms insurance companies investment banking firms and investment companies moreover the  act limits the type of assets that bdcs may acquire to certain prescribed “qualifying assets” and certain assets necessary for its operations such as office furniture equipment and facilities if at the time of acquisition less than  of the value of bdcs assets consist of qualifying assets qualifying assets include legal i privately acquired securities of companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time such bdc acquired their securities; ii securities of bankrupt or insolvent companies; iii securities of eligible portfolio companies controlled by a bdc; iv securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to any of the foregoing; and v cash items government securities and high­quality short­term debt also included in qualifying assets are follow­on investments in a company that met the definition of eligible portfolio company at the time of the fund’s initial investment but subsequently does not meet such definition because it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange if at the time of the follow­on investment the fund a owns at least  of i the greatest number of equity securities of such company including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities and ii the greatest amount of certain debt securities of such company held by the fund at any time during the period when such company was an eligible portfolio company and b is one of the twenty largest holders of record of the company’s outstanding voting securities the  act also places restrictions on the nature of transactions in which and the persons from whom securities can be purchased in order for the securities to be considered qualifying assets such restrictions include limiting purchases to transactions not involving a public offering and the requirement that securities be acquired directly from either the eligible portfolio company or its officers directors or affiliatesthe fund as a bdc may sell its securities at a price that is below its net asset value per share provided a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors determines that such sale would be in the best interests of the fund and its stockholders and upon the approval by the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities including a majority of the voting securities held by non­affiliated persons of such policy or practice within one year of such sale a majority of the disinterested directors also must determine in good faith in consultation with the underwriters of the offering if the offering is underwritten that the price of the securities being sold is not less than a price which closely approximates market value of the securities less any distribution discounts or commissions as defined in the  act the term “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the fund means the vote of i  or more of the shares present at a meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy or ii more than  of outstanding shares whichever is lessmany of the transactions involving a company and its affiliates as well as affiliates of those affiliates which were prohibited without the prior approval of the sec under the  act prior to its amendment in  are permissible for bdcs including the fund upon the prior approval of a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors and a majority of the directors having no financial interest in the transactions some transactions however involving certain persons related to the fund including its directors officers the investment manager and the company may still require the prior approval of the sec in general i any person who owns controls or holds power to vote more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares; ii any director executive officer or general partner of a person described in clause i; and iii any person who directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or is under common control with a person described in clause i must obtain the prior approval of a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors and in some situations the prior approval of the sec before engaging in certain transactions with the fund or any company controlled by the fund the  act generally does not restrict transactions between the fund and its eligible portfolio companies while a bdc may change the nature of its business so as to cease being a bdc and in connection therewith withdraw its election to be treated as a bdc only if authorized to do so by a majority vote as defined by the  act of its outstanding voting securities stockholder approval of changes in other fundamental investment policies of a bdc is not required in contrast to the general  act requirement which requires stockholder approval for a change in any fundamental investment policyunder the  act the fund may not incur borrowings unless immediately after the borrowing is incurred such borrowings would have “asset coverage” of at least  “asset coverage” means the ratio which the value of the fund’s total assets less all liabilities not represented by i the borrowings and ii any other liabilities constituting “senior securities” under the  act bears to the aggregate amount of such borrowings and senior securities the practical effect of this restriction is to limit the fund’s borrowings and legal other senior securities to  of its total assets less its liabilities other than the borrowings and other senior securities the  act also requires that if the fund borrows money provision be made to prohibit the declaration of any dividend or other distribution on the shares other than a dividend payable in shares or the repurchase by the fund of shares if after payment of such dividend or repurchase of shares the asset coverage of such borrowings would be below  if the fund is unable to pay dividends or distributions in the amounts required under the internal revenue code it might not be able to qualify for the pass­through status as a ric or if qualified to continue to so qualifytaxationthe following is a general summary of certain of the united states federal income tax laws relating to the fund this discussion is based on the internal revenue code the treasury regulations thereunder “regulations” published rulings procedures and announcements and court decisions as of the date hereof the tax law as well as the implementation thereof is subject to prospective and retroactive change and any such change might interfere with the fund’s ability to qualify as a ric or if the fund so qualifies to maintain such qualification this discussion does not purport to deal with all of the united states federal income tax consequences applicable to the fund or to all categories of investors some of whom may be subject to special rules in addition it does not address state local foreign or other taxes to which the fund or its investors may be subject or any proposed changes in applicable tax laws investors should consult their tax advisers with respect to an investment in fund sharestaxation of the fund as an ordinary corporationit is anticipated that commencing with the second year of its investment operations the fund will seek to meet the requirements including diversification requirements to qualify for the special pass­through status available to rics under the internal revenue code unless and until the fund meets these requirements it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to the stockholders and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to stockholders as dividends; thus such income will be subject to two layers of tax although corporate stockholders may be entitled to a dividends­received deduction there is no assurance that the fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a rictaxation of the fund as a ricconsequences of converting from an ordinary corporation to a ric in order to qualify as a ric at the end of the first year in which it so qualifies the fund must have no accumulated earnings and profits from years in which it was not taxed as a ric to meet this requirement before the end of the first year in which it qualifies as a ric the fund must distribute as dividends all of its accumulated earnings and profits in addition to the foregoing pursuant to the regulations the fund must either i recognize gain on the disposition of any asset during the ten year period the “recognition period” beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the fund qualifies for pass­through status as a ric that is held by the fund as of the beginning of such recognition period to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over b the fund’s adjusted tax basis in such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period such excess hereinafter “built­in gain” taxable at the highest regular corporate rates or ii elect to immediately recognize and pay tax on any such built­in gain with respect to any of its portfolio holdings and as described above distribute the earnings and profits from such deemed sales as a ric the fund generally would not be able to use any net operating loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to the first year in which the fund qualifies as a ricric qualification requirements in order to qualify the fund must among other things  at all times during the taxable year have a valid and effective election to be a bdc under sections f and  of the  act;  derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign legal currencies or other income including gains from options futures and forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership as defined in section h of the internal revenue code;  diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each taxable year a at least  of the value of the fund’s total assets is represented by i cash and cash items us government securities and securities of other rics and ii other securities counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed  of the value of the fund’s total assets and the fund does not own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities and b not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested in i the securities other than us government securities and securities of other rics of any one issuer ii the securities other than securities of other rics of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or iii the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships; and  file an election to be a ricif the fund qualifies as a ric and properly distributes to its stockholders each taxable year an amount equal to or exceeding the sum of   of its “investment company taxable income” as that term is defined in the internal revenue code which includes among other things dividends taxable interest and the excess of any net short­term capital gains over net long­term capital losses as reduced by certain deductible expenses without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and   of the excess of its gross tax­exempt interest if any over certain disallowed deductions the fund generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income of the fund distributed to its shareholders including “net capital gain” the excess of net long­term capital gain over net short­term capital loss however if the fund meets such distribution requirements and thus is eligible for pass­through status but chooses to retain some portion of its investment company taxable income or net capital gain it generally will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on the amount retained a distribution of warrants or equity investments to its stockholders will be treated as a sale by the fund of such assets with the excess of the fair market value of those assets over their tax basis being the amount of the income or gain to the fund arising from the distributionif after initially qualifying as a ric the fund fails to qualify as a ric that is eligible for pass­through status for any taxable year it will be treated as a us corporation subject to us federal income tax thereby subjecting any income earned by the fund to tax at the corporate level and to a further tax at the stockholder level when such income is distributed in such a case there may be substantial tax and other costs associated with re­ qualifying as a ricthe fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax “excise tax” to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least  of its ordinary income for such calendar year and  of its capital gain net income for the one­year period ending on october  of such calendar year plus certain other previously undistributed amounts for these purposes any taxable income retained by the fund and on which it pays federal income tax will be treated as having been distributedthe fund currently intends to distribute in each year for which it qualifies as a ric substantially all of its net investment income and capital gain net income so as not to be subject to either federal income tax or excise taxeffect of certain investments and investment practices the fund’s activities generally will be unlike the typical activities engaged in by most investment companies that seek to qualify as rics for federal income tax purposes certain aspects of these activities may at times make it more difficult for the fund to satisfy the requirements for qualifying as a ric than is the case for other investment companies for example because the timing of borrowings under the fund’s loan commitments will be primarily controlled by the borrower it is possible that due to borrowings being made under some commitments at a faster pace than others the fund might experience difficulty in meeting the diversification requirement as of the close of a quarter of a taxable year this difficulty might be exacerbated during the early period of the fund’s existence when the fund will have outstanding financing commitments and loans funded thereunder to fewer borrowers than will be the legal case for later periods if the fund does not meet the diversification requirement as of the close of any such quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter it generally will not lose its status as a ric for such quarter if such discrepancy is eliminated within  days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to eliminate a discrepancy within the  day periodto the extent that the terms of venture loans provide for the receipt by the fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term known as residual income the fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan and to include such accrued income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year thus in order to meet the distribution requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or the excise tax on undistributed income the fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives those distributions will be made from the fund’s cash assets from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed fundstaxation of the fund’s stockholders if the fund qualifies as a ricgeneral generally dividends paid to stockholders that are attributable to the fund’s net investment income which for this purpose includes net short‑term capital gains will be taxable to stockholders and therefore the members as ordinary income since the fund’s income is expected to be derived primarily from sources that do not pay “qualified dividend income” such dividends generally will not qualify for the maximum  federal income tax rate available to individuals on qualified dividend income capital gain distributions are taxable to members as long­term capital gains regardless of how long the stockholder has held its shares or the member has held its interests it is not anticipated that a significant portion of the fund’s dividends will qualify for the dividends­received deduction for corporate members in respect of their distributive shares of fund dividendsdistributions generally are includible in the income of the stockholders at the time the distribution is received any distribution however declared by the fund as of a record date in october november or december and paid to the stockholders the following january is deemed to have been paid by the fund and received by the stockholders and therefore the company on december  of the year declared for both federal income and excise tax purposes this will prevent the application of the excise tax to the fund as a result of the delay in the payment of the dividendsif for any calendar year the fund’s total distributions exceed its current and accumulated earnings and profits the excess will generally be considered a tax­free return of capital to the stockholders and therefore the company to the extent of each stockholder’s adjusted basis in its shares and then as capital gain the amount treated as tax­free return of capital will reduce the adjusted tax basis of the stockholders’ shares thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss on the sale of the sharesin general upon the sale or other disposition of shares the seller will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the seller’s adjusted basis in the shares any loss on the sale recognized will be disallowed to the extent the seller has acquired or entered into a contract to acquire substantially identical shares within a period beginning  days before the disposition and ending  days after the disposition in such case the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss gain or loss realized upon a sale of shares generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss the gain or loss will be a long­term capital gain or loss if the shares were held for more than one year in addition if the shares sold were not held for more than six months any loss on the sale will be treated as long­term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividend received by the seller with respect to such shareslegal the fund and the company are required to withhold  of reportable payments which may include dividends and capital gain distributions to individuals and certain other noncorporate stockholders or members who do not provide the fund or the company with a correct taxpayer identification number on irs form w‑ or who otherwise are subject to backup withholding federal withholding taxes at a rate of  or a lesser treaty rate may apply to distributions to stockholders of the fund and members who are nonresident aliens or foreign partnerships trusts or corporations the rules governing united states federal income taxation of foreign members are complex and prospective non­us members should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal state and local income tax laws with regard to an investment in interests including any reporting requirementsif the fund is not deemed to be engaged in a trade or business individuals and certain other persons who are members will be required to include in their gross income their allocable share of certain fund expenses relating to the production of gross income that are allocable to the company these members therefore will be deemed to receive gross income from the company in excess of the distributions they actually receive such allocated expenses may be deductible by an individual member as a miscellaneous itemized deduction subject to the limitation on miscellaneous itemized deductions not exceeding  of adjusted gross incomethe fund will notify stockholders following the end of each calendar year of the amounts of dividends and capital gain distributions paid or deemed paid during the yeartax­exempt investors qualified plans individual retirement accounts and investors exempt from taxation under section c of the internal revenue code collectively “tax­exempt entities” are generally exempt from taxation except to the extent that they have “unrelated business taxable income” “ubti” determined in accordance with sections ­ of the internal revenue code if the fund qualifies as a ric distributions by the fund to the company allocable to a tax­exempt entity member that are treated as dividends generally not be considered ubti and therefore will be exempt from federal income tax even if the fund borrows to acquire its investment assets under section b of the internal revenue code ubti does not include dividends received by a tax­exempt entity as a general rule the income tax provisions relating to corporations apply to rics unless subchapter m of the internal revenue code provides otherwise and thus section b should apply to exclude from ubti dividends paid by a ric to a tax­exempt entity this conclusion is also supported by revenue ruling ­ which applies section b to exclude from ubti dividends paid to the tax­exempt stockholders of a real estate investment trust a conduit entity that invests in real estate and is substantially similar to a ric for tax purposes on the same theory if a tax­exempt entity however borrows money to purchase its interests or the company borrows money to purchase an interest in the fund a portion of its income from the company will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt­financed property” rules of the internal revenue codecertain organizations that are exempt from taxation under the internal revenue code are subject to different ubti rules and accordingly should consult with their tax advisers regarding the tax treatment of their allocable share of income from the company and the fund dividend distributions by the fund allocable to a charitable organization that is a private foundation should constitute investment income for purposes of the excise tax on net investment income of private foundations imposed by section  of the internal revenue codeemployeesthe fund expects to have no employees and will rely on the investment manager and its officers all of whom are employed and paid by the investment manager to administer

factors generalno operating history; reliance on management the fund is newly organized and has not entered into any financing or equity transactions or identified any specific transactions in which to invest the fund could require substantial time to become fully invested pending investment all cash that the fund has received pursuant to capital calls from the company will be committed to short­term high grade investments that present relatively low investment risk but provide a correspondingly lower returnthe fund will be wholly dependent for the selection structuring closing and monitoring of its investments on the diligence and skill of the investment manager acting under the supervision of the fund’s board of directors although the operating principals of the investment manager have over  years of combined experience in investing in venture lending transactions and equity investments there can be no assurance that the fund will attain its investment objective furthermore the investment manager does not have substantial experience investing in special situations such as convertible and subordinated debt of public and late‑stage private companies the officers of the investment manager will have primary responsibility for the selection of the companies in which the fund will invest the negotiation of the terms of such investments and the monitoring of such investments after they are made although the officers of the investment manager intend to devote such time as is necessary to the affairs of the fund they are not required to devote full time to the management of the fund furthermore there can be no assurance that any officer will remain associated with the investment manager or that if an officer ceased to be associated with the investment manager the investment manager would be able to find a qualified person or persons to fill their positionsilliquid and long­term investment the shares will not be registered under the  act and are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer there will be no trading market for the shares and stockholders most likely will have to hold their shares until the final liquidation of the fund on december   the fund’s period of existence will automatically expire; however the liquidation process might not be completed for a significant period after the fund’s dissolution an investment in the fund is therefore illiquid and should be considered only by investors financially able to maintain their investment for the long termcompetition other entities and individuals compete for investments similar to those proposed to be made by the fund some of whom with respect to investments in the form of loans and many of whom with respect to the equity investments and convertible and subordinated debt have greater resources than the fund competition could increase given the low barriers to entry into the industry additionally the fund’s need to comply with provisions of the  act pertaining to bdcs and if the fund qualifies as a ric provisions of the internal revenue code pertaining to rics might restrict the fund’s flexibility as compared with its competitors the need to compete for investment opportunities may make it necessary for the fund to offer borrowers or companies in which it makes equity investments more attractive terms than otherwise might be the caseconvertible debt convertible debt instruments issued by public and late‑stage private companies may comprise some of the special situations in which the fund may invest convertible debt generally offers lower interest yields than non‑convertible debt of similar quality the market value of debt tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline the market value of convertible debt however often reflects the market price of common stock of the issuing company when that stock price is greater than the conversion price of the convertible debt the conversion price is the predetermined price at which the debt instrument could be exchanged for the associated stock as the market price of the underlying legal common stock declines the price of the convertible debt tends to be influenced more by the yield of the debt instrument thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stocksubordinated debt part of the special situations in which the fund may invest may consist of subordinated debt instruments which tend to be predominantly high‑yield non‑convertible debt securitiesinvestments in highyield securities involve substantial risk of loss subinvestment grade nonconvertible debt securities or comparable unrated securities are commonly referred to as “junk debt” and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer’s ability to pay interest and principal and are susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse economic or business developments the market values for highyield securities tend to be very volatile and these securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securitiesleverage the fund intends to borrow money from and issue debt securities to banks insurance companies and other lenders to obtain additional funds to originate venture loans if such borrowings are available on terms that are acceptable to the investment manager and board of directors of the fund any borrowings of the fund will be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the  act see the discussion at item  under the caption “regulation”the use of leverage increases investment risk the fund’s use of leverage is premised upon the expectation that the fund’s all­in borrowing costs will be lower than the return the fund achieves on its investments to the extent the income or capital gains derived from investments purchased with borrowed funds exceeds the cost of borrowing the fund’s overall return will be greater than if leverage had not been used conversely if the income or capital gain from the investments purchased with borrowed funds is not sufficient to cover the cost of borrowing or if the fund incurs capital losses the return to the fund will be less than if leverage had not been used and therefore the amount available for distribution will be reduced or potentially eliminated furthermore since the calculation of the investment management fee paid to the investment manager the “investment management fee” is based commencing two years after the closing of the offering of interests in the company on a percentage of the managed assets such fee will be higher if the fund utilizes leverage than if no borrowings were incurred the fund expects that lenders will require that the fund pledge portfolio assets as collateral for borrowings and may require that the company provide guarantees or other credit enhancement if the fund is unable to service the borrowings the fund may risk the loss of such pledged assetslenders are also expected to require that the fund agree to loan covenants limiting the fund’s ability to incur additional debt or otherwise limiting the fund’s flexibility and loan agreements may provide for acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness if certain financial tests are not met to minimize risks associated with lending money at fixed rates the fund may enter into interest rate hedging transactions with respect to all or any portion of the fund’s investments there can be no assurance that such interest rate hedging transactions will be available in forms acceptable to the fund in addition entering into interest rate hedging transactions raises costs to the fund finally it is possible that the fund could incur losses from being “overhedged” which would result if the loan that was hedged is repaid faster than expectedregulation the fund has elected to be treated as a bdc under the small business incentive act of  which modified the  act although bdcs are now exempt from registration under the  act and are relieved from compliance with a number of the provisions of the  act there are now greater restrictions in some respects on permitted types of investments for bdcs moreover the applicable provisions of the  act continue to impose numerous restrictions on the activities of the fund including restrictions on leverage and on the nature of its investments while the fund is not aware of any judicial rulings under and is aware of only a few administrative interpretations of the small business incentive act of  there can be no assurance that such act will be interpreted or administratively implemented in a manner consistent with the fund’s objectives or manner of operation see the discussion at item  under the caption “regulation”legal litigation the fund could be subject to litigation by borrowers based on theories of breach of contract to lend “lender liability” or otherwise in connection with its loan and investment transactions the defense of such a lawsuit even if ultimately determined to be without merit could be costly and timeconsumingtax status the fund must meet a number of requirements described under the caption “federal income taxation” to qualify for the pass­through status as a ric and if qualified to continue to so qualify for example the fund must meet specified asset diversification standards under the internal revenue code which might be difficult to meet if the borrowers under some loans drew down their committed financing at a faster rate than other borrowers particularly during the early periods of the fund’s operations if the fund experiences difficulty in meeting the diversification requirement for any quarter of its taxable year it might accelerate capital calls or if available borrowings in order to increase the portion of the fund’s total assets represented by cash cash items and us government securities as of the close of the following fiscal quarter and thus attempt to meet the diversification requirement the fund would however incur additional interest and other expenses in connection with any such accelerated borrowings and increased investments by the fund in cash cash items and us government securities whether the funds to make such investments are derived from called equity capital or from accelerated borrowings are likely to reduce the fund’s return furthermore there can be no assurance that the fund would be able to meet the diversification requirements through such actions failure to qualify as a ric would deny the fund pass­through status and in a year in which the fund has taxable income would have a significant adverse effect on the return of the fundwhen the fund elects to convert its status from that of an ordinary or c corporation to that of a ric it must choose either to i pay tax whenever an asset is sold during the ten years following the conversion on at most the amount of gain which would have been realized had the asset been sold on the conversion date or ii treat the entire amount of “built‑in gain” as income at the time of conversioncalculation of investment management fee for the first  months following the first closing of the offering of interests in the company the investment management fee will be calculated with reference to the committed equity capital of the company regardless of when or if all of such capital is called or released this calculation could result in the investment management fee being disproportionately large during such period relative to the value of the fund’s portfolio if the total assets of the fund during such period are low compared to the committed equity capitalinvestment risksinternational investments the fund could invest up to but not more than  of its total assets in foreign based companies foreign investments are subject to most of the same risks as domestic investments as well as the political economic and other uncertainties associated with foreign activities including the risk of war and political unrest the impact of laws and policies of foreign governments and the united states affecting foreign investment and the possibility of being subject to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states furthermore as discussed under the caption “remedies on default” below there may be practical and local law impediments to costeffective recovery against collateral located in a foreign country moreover it is possible that taxes may be required to be withheld by the foreign company on dividend and interest payments received by the fund with respect to such foreign investments although capital gains derived by the fund with respect to such investments in such foreign company may often be exempt from non­us income or withholding taxes the treatment of capital gains varies among jurisdictions if the income from such foreign investments is subject to non­us income or withholding taxes the fund will attempt to negotiate offsetting gross­up payments from the foreign based company no assurances however can be given that the fund would be able to negotiate such offsetting paymentsforeign currency  exchange rate risks fund assets and income may be denominated in various currencies contributions and distributions however will be denominated in us dollars as a result the return of the fund on any investment may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates legal any future imposed devaluations of local currencies inflationary pressures and the success of the investment itself in addition the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currenciesaccounting  disclosure standards accounting auditing financial and other reporting standards practices and disclosure requirements in countries in which the fund may invest are not necessarily equivalent to those required under united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or international accounting standards ias accordingly less information may be available to investorscredit risks most of the companies with which the fund will enter into financing transactions will not have achieved profitability may experience substantial fluctuations in their operating results or in some cases will not have significant operating revenues the ability of any borrower to meet its obligations to the fund therefore will depend to a significant extent on the willingness of such borrower’s venture capital equity investors or outside investors to provide additional equity financing which in turn will depend on the borrower’s success in meeting its business plan the market climate for venture capital investments generally and many other factors the companies to which the fund will provide financing will frequently be engaged in the development of new products or technologies and the success of these efforts or the ability of the companies to successfully manufacture or market products or technologies developed cannot be assured these companies frequently face intense competition including competition from companies with greater resources and may face risks of product or technological obsolescence non­acceptance in the market or rapidly changing regulatory environments any of which could adversely affect their prospects the success of such companies often depends on the management talents and efforts of one person or small group of persons whose death disability or resignation would adversely affect the companyremedies upon default in the event of a default on a portfolio loan the available remedies to the fund would include legal action against the borrower and foreclosure or repossession of collateral given by the borrower the fund could experience significant delays in exercising its rights as a secured lender and might incur substantial costs in taking possession of and liquidating its collateral and in taking other steps to protect its investment the fund generally will require that it have a first priority security interest in any equipment of a borrower financed with the proceeds of the fund’s loans although that security interest may extend to the borrower’s other assets in which another lender might have a senior or parity security interest on occasion the fund will make loans to a borrower that has one or more other secured lenders including the fund’s immediate predecessors venture lending  leasing v inc venture lending  leasing vi inc and venture lending  leasing vii inc “fund vii” in such circumstances the fund may share all or a portion of its collateral with the other lenders and will enter into intercreditor agreements governing the respective rights of the fund and such other lenders which could limit the fund’s flexibility in pursuing its remedies as a secured creditor and reduce the proceeds realized from foreclosing or taking possession of the collateral in the case of growth capital or working capital loans where the loan proceeds can be used by the company for general working capital purposes the fund will typically receive either a broader lien on substantially all of the borrower’s assets including its intellectual property or a lien on substantially all of the borrower’s assets excluding intellectual property and a negative pledge on such intellectual propertyas noted above the fund will utilize certain of its funds in investments that involve the financing of equipment assets equipment assets are often subject to rapid depreciation or obsolescence such that it is likely the value of the assets underlying a loan to finance such assets will depreciate during the term of the loan transaction below the amount of the borrower’s obligations in addition although borrowers will be required under the transaction documents to provide customary insurance for the assets underlying a loan and will be prohibited from disposing of the assets without the fund’s consent compliance with these covenants cannot be assured and in the event of non­compliance the assets could become unavailable to the fund due to destruction theft sale or other circumstances realization of value from intellectual property collateral can also be time consuming and present special challenges given the often unique nature and limited market for such assets the fund’s ability to obtain payment beyond the collateral underlying the loan from the borrower legal might be limited by bankruptcy or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights in limited instances where the fund takes security interests in a borrower’s assets located in a foreign country there may be practical and local law impediments to costeffective recovery against such collateral therefore there can be no assurance that the fund would ultimately collect the full amount owed on a defaulted loanemerging company risks the possibility that the companies in which the fund invests will not be able to commercialize their technology or product concept presents significant risk to the fund additionally although some of such companies may already have a commercially successful product or product line at the time of investment technology products and services often have a more limited market or life span than products in other industries thus the ultimate success of these companies may depend on their ability to continually innovate in increasingly competitive markets most of the companies in which the fund invests will require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy their continuing growth and working capital requirements each round of venture financing is typically intended to provide a company with enough capital to reach the next stage of development the circumstances or market conditions under which such companies will seek additional capital is unpredictable it is possible that one or more of such companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be able to do so only at a price or on terms which are unfavorableprivately­held company risks the fund intends to invest primarily in privately­held companies generally very little public information exists about these companies and the fund will be required to rely on the ability of the investment manager to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies moreover these companies typically depend upon the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals and the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a significant impact on the investment returns from a particular company also these companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger companies they are thus generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating resultsdue diligence risks before making investments the investment manager intends to conduct a limited amount of due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment the investment manager will be required to rely on resources available to it including information provided by the target of the investment and in some circumstances third party investigations the due diligence process may at times be subjective with respect to newly organized companies for which only limited information is available accordingly there can be no assurance that the due diligence investigation that the investment manager will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity further there can be no assurance that such an investigation will result in an investment being successfulcrisis in financial markets the ability of the fund to provide an acceptable return may be adversely affected by economic factors to which the market place is subject volatility in the global financial markets reached unprecedented levels during  and  and these volatile conditions have since continued albeit to a lesser extent and may continue into the future this market turmoil could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s business and operations the tightening of the credit markets could impair the fund’s ability to utilize leverage to maximize the return it achieves on investmentsit is possible that market conditions could decrease the demand for venture loans furthermore market conditions could also adversely impact the ability of the fund’s borrowers to meet their obligations to the fund and the value of the fund’s direct investments in companies most of the companies in which the fund will invest will not have achieved profitability and will require substantial equity financing to satisfy their continuing growth and working capital requirements the economic downturn could decrease the demand for such borrower’s products and technology thereby impairing such borrower’s financial condition and ability to raise additional equity financing from outside investors this could result in an increase in borrower defaults legal under their obligations to the fund or a decrease in the value of the fund’s direct equity investments us and global economic conditions could continue to deteriorate and remain weak for an extended period of timeother global economic risks in addition to the crisis in the financial markets discussed above the ability of the fund to provide an acceptable return may be adversely affected by other economic and business factors to which the us market place is subject these factors which generally are beyond the control of the investment manager include general economic conditions such as inflation and fluctuations in general business conditions; the impact of further terrorist attacks against the united states; the effects of strikes labor disputes and foreign political unrest; and uncertainty of the recovery of the us economyspeculative nature of warrants and equity investments the value of the warrants that the fund generally will receive in connection with its financing investments is dependent on the value of the equity securities for which the warrants can be exercised the value of such warrants direct equity investments and equities received upon conversion of debt instruments is dependent primarily on the success of the company’s business strategy and the growth of its earnings but also depends on general economic and equity market conditions the prospects for achieving consistent profitability in the case of many companies in which the fund will invest are speculative the warrants equity securities for which the warrants can be exercised direct equity investments and equities received upon conversion of debt instruments generally will be restricted securities that cannot readily be sold for some period of time if the value of the equity securities underlying a warrant does not increase above the exercise price during the life of the warrant the fund would permit the warrant to expire unexercised and the warrant would then have no valueilliquidity of investments the fund anticipates that substantially all of its portfolio investments other than short­term investments will consist of securities that at the time of acquisition are subject to restrictions on sale and for which no ready market will exist restricted securities cannot be sold publicly without prior agreement with the issuer to register the securities under the  act or by selling such securities under rule  or other provisions of the  act which permit only limited sales under specified conditions venture loans and equity investments are privately negotiated transactions and there is no established trading market in which such loans and equity investments can be sold convertible and subordinated debt investments may also be privately negotiated transactions in the case of warrants or equity securities the fund generally will realize the value of such securities only if the issuer is able to make an initial public offering of its shares or enters into a business combination with another company which purchases the fund’s warrants or equity securities or exchanges them for publicly­traded securities of the acquiror the feasibility of such transactions depends upon the entity’s financial results as well as general economic and equity market conditions in the past crisesin the financial markets have dramatically reduced the volume of initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions in the market place if such a crisis recurs the fund’s ability to realize liquidity through its investments will be impaired furthermore even if the restricted warrants or equity securities owned become publicly­traded the fund’s ability to sell such securities may be limited by the lack or limited nature of a trading market for such securities if the fund holds material nonpublic information regarding the issuer of the securities the fund’s ability to sell such securities may also be limited by insider trading laws when restricted securities are sold to the public the fund under certain circumstances may be deemed an “underwriter” or a controlling person with respect thereto for the purposes of the  act and be subject to liabilities as such under that actbecause of the illiquidity of the fund’s investments most of its assets will be carried at fair value as determined by the investment manager approved by the board of directors this value will not necessarily reflect the amount ultimately realized upon a sale of the assetsnon­diversified status the fund will be classified as a “non­diversified” investment company under the  act at such time as the fund meets certain asset diversification requirements the fund intends to qualify as a ric under the internal revenue code and will thereafter seek to continually meet the diversification legal standards thereunder nevertheless the fund’s assets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than if its investments were more widely diversifiedconflicts of interesttransactions with fund vii the investment manager also serves as investment manager for fund vii which is expected to continue to make new investments through the termination of fund vii’s investment period such investment period which terminates on december   but which may be extended by the investment manager by up to two calendar qarters at its sole discretion the “fund vii investment period” provided however that from and after that date that is one year prior to the termination of the fund vii investment period the “fund vii investment period rampdown date” fund vii will only make investments that fund vii committed to make prior to the fund vii investment period rampdown date the fund’s board of directors has determined that so long as fund vii has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than december   the date on which fund vii’s existence automatically expires the fund will invest in each portfolio company in which fund vii invests “investments” so long as prior to any such investment the boards of directors of fund vii and the fund receive a memorandum summarizing the proposed investment and do not object to such investment the amount of each investment will be allocated between the fund and fund vii in accordance with the decisions of the respective boards of directors of fund vii and the fund if they so choose the allocation may be based on the committed equity capital of venture lending  leasing vii llc “vll vii” and initially  million for the fund or such greater or lesser amount that is received upon the closing of the offering of interests in the company which may be as much as  million so long as vll vii has capital available to invest the committed equity capital of vll vii is  million therefore if subscriptions for  million of interests are received by the company each investment could be allocated approximately  to the fund and  to fund vii in any case as noted above fund vii can only invest to the extent that it has capital available for investment; after fund vii no longer has capital available for investment fund vii will no longer invest in transactions in which the fund invests as of may   vll vii has approximately  million of committed capital which has not yet been called from its investors this means that the funds with which fund vii has available to invest with the fund as of may   consist of a  million plus b amounts which fund vii borrows plus c any proceeds from principal payments received on loans plus d the proceeds from the sale of securities in an amount equal to the cost basis of securities sold and plus e the amounts of cash on hand at the company and at the fund after the fund vii investment period rampdown date fund vii will no longer be permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers; however fund vii will be permitted to fund existing commitments as described above while investing the fund’s capital in the same companies in which fund vii is also investing could provide the fund with greater diversification and access to larger transactions it could also result in a slower pace of investment than would be the case if the fund were investing in companies by itselfalthough fund vii and the fund intend to invest in the same companies in the respective proportions described above the fund may at any time with the approval of its board of directors i discontinue investing with fund vii with respect to any or all future investments or ii choose to invest in different proportions with fund vii than described above in addition the fund has no control over fund vii which is not required to invest with the fund in any particular proportion or at all and may choose to discontinue investing with the fund or to invest in different proportions than described in the prior paragraph new investment opportunities may be allocated in different proportions than those described above  if fund vii is restricted from making such investment because either the fund vii investment rampdown date has occurred or the fund vii investment period has expired  if fund vii in the discretion of the investment manager does not have available commitments to make such investment pro rata  in order to accommodate a borrower that does not want to have two separate lenders or  in order to comply with the investment and tax diversification requirements of fund vii andor the fund as determined in the discretion of the investment manager in each case subject to the review and approval of the board of directors of fund vii and the board legal of directors of the fund for the avoidance of doubt if fund vii andor vll vii is investing in a company for the purpose of protecting the value of its existing investment in such company for example followon equity investments made pursuant to paytoplay provisions or in a “down round” of equity to avoid dilution or otherwise to prevent any dilution in fund vii’s andor vll vii’s percentage ownership in the company then such investment will not be treated as an investment for purposes of the foregoing and will not be subject to the procedures described above regarding the sharing of investments between the fund and fund vii it is the intention of the investment manager to sponsor one or more private investment entities formed for the purpose of making equity and equityoriented investments other than asset backed investments in privately held companies collectively the “equity fund” the equity fund will generally make equity investments in the same companies in which the company andor the fund will make equity investments in those situations the investment manager intends to follow an allocation formula that will permit investment by the company not the fund and the equity fund pursuant to the allocation formula equity investment opportunities which will generally be subject to such allocation formula include rights to make an equity investment in a company in which the fund has made a debt investments where such rights were acquired as part of the terms of such debt instruments by the fund provided however that in no event will any warrants or other similar rights to acquire stock or other securities in a company in which the fund has made a debt investment and which were issued in connection with the debt investment transaction be shared with the equity fundintercreditor agreements in each transaction in which both the fund and fund vii invest it is expected that the fund and fund vii will enter into an intercreditor agreement pursuant to which the fund and fund vii will cooperate in pursuing their remedies following a default by the common borrower generally under such intercreditor agreements each party would agree that its security interest would be treated in parity with the security interest of the other party regardless of which security interest would have priority under applicable law accordingly proceeds realized from the sale of any collateral or the exercise of any other creditor’s rights will be allocated between the fund and fund vii pro rata in accordance with the amounts of their respective investments an exception to the foregoing arrangement would occur in situations where for example one of the lenders financed specific items of equipment collateral; in that case usually the lender who financed the specific assets will have a senior lien on that asset and the other lender will have a junior priority lien even though they may ratably share liens of equal priority on other assets of the common borroweras a result of such intercreditor agreements the fund may have less flexibility in pursuing its remedies following a default than it would have had had there been no intercreditor agreement and the fund may realize fewer proceeds in addition because the fund and fund vii invest at the same time in the same borrower such borrower would be required to service two loans rather than one any additional administrative costs or burdens resulting therefrom may make the fund a less attractive lender and may make it more difficult for the fund to acquire such loanseffect of borrowings for the first  months following the first closing of the offering of interests in the company the investment management fee will be calculated with reference to the committed equity capital of the company regardless of when or if all of such capital is called or released thereafter the investment management fee will be based on a percentage of the fund’s assets including amounts derived from borrowed funds therefore decisions by the investment manager to cause the fund to borrow additional funds may increase the quarterly fees payable to the investment manager the fund’s overall borrowing limits however are set by the fund’s board of directors in light of its fiduciary obligationsindemnification and exculpation the charter of the fund provides for indemnification of directors officers employees and agents including the investment manager of the fund to the full extent permitted by applicable state law and the  act including the advance of expenses and reasonable counsel fees the charter of the fund also contains a provision eliminating personal liability of a fund director or officer to the fund or its stockholder for money damages subject to specified exceptions a successful claim for such legal indemnification including payment of any expenses and counsel fees would reduce the fund’s assets by the amounts paid for a more detailed discussion of such indemnification provisions including the limitations placed on a party’s right to indemnification see the discussion herein at item  “indemnification of directors and officers”selection of disinterested directors initially at the time the fund is formed a majority of the fund’s directors will be interested directors the board of directors of the fund intends that

by stockholders the initial selection of directors including the disinterested directors will be made by the investment managerinterests in potential portfolio companies the officers of the investment manager may be passive investors in companies in which the fund is considering an investment either directly or through an investment in a venture capital fund that in turn is an investor in such a company although the investment manager and the fund intend to adopt a policy that any such interest be disclosed by the officer and reported to the board of directors of the fund and that such officer refrain from participating in the decision to cause the fund to offer credit to or make an investment in any such company such interests create a potential conflict of interest in that the officer could try to influence the fund’s investment decisions with regard to such companyitem      financial informationthe fund has not commenced business and has no revenues or assets other than

rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or the party actually received an improper personal benefit or in the case of any criminal

the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses in addition the mgcl permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation’s receipt of a a written affirmation by the director or officer of his good
