context matters was born from the realization that there is a common data theme from clinical trial development through market access considerations health technology assessment hta agencies outside of the united states were conducting clinical comparative effectiveness and economic evaluations on drugs yet there was no standardized data approach or searchable capability to understand and compare these assessments at the same time information used for these evaluations was based directly on clinical trial data—the same data used for regulatory approval disparate data domains unstructured data and a lack of understanding as to how the decisions in clinical trial endpoints have an effect very far downstream in reimbursement decisions or comparative and costeffectiveness calculations were creating a data gap as a result the ability of biopharma professionals to make wellinformed strategic decisions was being impededthis data gap was an opportunity to create a data analytical model that would showcase the relationship between clinical trial design decisions and reimbursement decisions—with the ability to drill into what criteria and comparators would be important for later economic and comparative effectiveness evaluations to address this we first created an overarching context—starting from the end goal of market access and health outcomes used for both cost and comparative effectiveness evaluations and working back toward the choice of clinical trial endpoints that would have been made at an earlier stage this required structuring a substantial amount of unstructured data—creating a data architecture that could accommodate disparate domains of data and utilizing analysts who could parse match and categorize across different terminology language syntax and public policy inferences every element and data point is subject to the highest level of quality control rendering an overall flexible data model able to accommodate multiple contexts necessary for complex decision making through the integration of our proprietary data model innovative technology platform and bestinclass data management process we have created an elegant solution that relates market access considerations with clinical trial design our solution enables a holistic approach that provides pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the critical data and context needed to develop drugs for both an approvable and a reimbursable label—all at a global leveltoday we work with more than two dozen large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies who are using our data and our application to support a myriad of different activities—from strategic planning of market access to understanding specific drugs and disease conditions to tracking competitive intelligence to thinking about clinical trial endpoint selection to track timelines across regulatory and reimbursement decisions that can extend to label extensions and reassessments context matters founded in  and

conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published   may   ceocfo dr ho would you tell us the concept of context matters dr ho it is a very straightforward concept for a very complex problem basically context matters is a web based application database company that in essence has aggregated large sets of data around pharmaceutical risk  mainly everything in drug development all the way through reimbursement information  we created the company on a single observation and ideathere was a great deal of publicly available global information about different drugshow the drugs worked how drugs were being viewed by the different governments around the world and how drugs were being judged both in terms of value and risk none of that information was captured in a way that was straightforward enough for pharmaceutical companies to easily look across and understand the risk that their drug portfolios might be taking on there was no clear way to understand the value of their products based on how governments payers and agencies viewed the products in their portfolio basically there was no clarity or ability to predict how the entities who are responsible for paying for the product were assigning economic value   ceocfo what was the most difficult part of the technology to create dr ho i think the most difficult part for any company that is inherently a data company is to ensure data transparency and data integrity particularly when the data comes from multiple sources in multiple languages and available in multiple formats rather than focusing on the difficulty of the technology which was not the most difficult part it is more appropriate to focus on how to ensure that the data had complete integrity and transparency here we are taking information from multiple countries and capturing methodologies that were somewhat understood by some countries and maybe not as well understood by others we were taking information from unstructured formats to structured datasets and everything in between and trying to extract the information in a very consistent and qualitycontrolled way just to ensure that the information still made sense and still retained the original context around it when a customer or user was looking to find a particular answer or insight in essence i would argue that the most difficult part of building the product was to curate and standardize the data and making it meaningful in a way that would support analysis and insights about drug development and drug reimbursement the technology itself was really not the difficult part   ceocfo the data is not static so how do you continually keep it current for the latest reports and information dr ho we keep current in two ways first i have an extremely talented group of data analysts and data scientists all of them have masters degrees in public health and some of them have masters in science degrees many of them understand data and are comfortable with the inherent uncertainty around multiple sources and fragmented data regardless of the format this group literally goes through reimbursement decisions made around the world one document at a time extracting information in a very consistent and efficient methodological way   for data that is already structured it is all about ensuring the correct parameters for directly loading the information and then applying a rigorous quality control process   we are what we call information format agnostic in that we do not care about the original format as long as it is published the origins are clear and it is sourceable reliability and data integrity is paramount and we can employ all methods to access the data whether it is through technology or human judgment   ceocfo who is using your services today dr ho currently we service life sciences companiesprimarily the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry we work closely with commercial market access groups and rd groups we work with the groups that are tasked to understand the value of their products and to ensure that their products gain proper access amongst the different countries around the world the application of our data is actually broader than market access and we find that several of our customers are utilizing the information to influence clinical trial design we are also beginning to make inroads into biotech which is a welcome addition   ceocfo how long has the product been available in its current format dr ho the st commercial grade version of the product launched in september so about  months ago we had developed prototypes and beta versions prior to septemberof which we actually built with the support of our customers we had early pilot and beta customers who understood the idea of what we were trying to do and who were quite patient worked with us and gave us many insights as we were working through those prototypes and through beta versions when we launched the commercial grade application in september last year it was very quickly welcomed as having much of the data that was difficult to find and a user experience that was novel and conducive for both analysis and communication   ceocfo what is your geographic reach dr ho our application covers data from south america asia europe as well as north america and australia our customers are predominantly from both north america and europe at this time   ceocfo how do you reach potential customers dr ho much of it comes from networking and wordofmouth i came out of the pharmaceutical industry and have found both my former colleagues have been wonderful at introducing us to potential customers everyone sees that have created a solution for an increasing need in the marketplace global market access for drugs has become increasingly difficult to gauge and manage for pharmaceutical companies as such we have found that companies talk about us as do the trade organizations and we are also creating a presence at some of the tradeshows and relevant conferences more recently   ceocfo how have you ensured easeofuse dr ho we invested a great deal in user experience and frontend design on our application the application that we built was based on the idea that it was not just good enough to collect the information and simply curate it and standardize it it was more important that the user could determine the context and in essence have control at determining what data interested them and what hypotheses and questions they wished to answer we designed a user interface on the front end that is made up with a series of different types of screens and functionalities that allow a customer to actually choose the context they want to look at information we also invested a great deal of time resources and effort into dynamic informational graphics displays when you use our application you have a delightful experience you are able to look at a great amount of insightful and very indepth data all at once without feeling like you are digging you way through a mountain of information the information is extracted in a sophisticated and transparent way and laid out in a fashion that allows you to manipulate the manner you view the information and ask an infinite number of questions   a large part of what we think has been part of our success is that not only did we go after making sure that the data had great integrity but we put considerable money and resources into ensuring that the application itself as a webbased software tool worked very seamlessly to us a driving principle of development is to ensure that the user is in control our platform and tools empower our customers by providing them with the information they need in an easytouse intuitive and delightful manner we took the best of user experience information graphics software development database management and data curation and put it all together for a singular data analytics experience   ceocfo do you provide any analysis or summary or is it the raw data and up to the user to decide how they are interested in reviewing dr ho it is actually a combination we give foremost access to our customers to be able to have direct access to the original data raw makes it sound like it has not been refined in actuality the data has been extracted directly from the source but we have curated the actual extraction so the data is clean standardized and easy to compare across multiple dimensions without worry that the context will be lost when data is arrayed in this way and is as agile as we have made it then our customers are then able to do their own analysis very easily in fact most analysis is done by the customer directly and we expect this will only increase as we roll out additional analytical features and functions   that said our customers will sometimes ask us for analysis across multiple domains of data and we will help them build a customized sophisticated analysis for that purpose   a large part of the vision for our platform is to continue to empower our customers by giving them more capabilities to do analysis easily themselves with smart tools and the ability to cross domains of information   ceocfo are you funded for the growth moving ahead dr ho we have been very fortunate we have built this company in almost a bootstrap kind of manner we raised money through friends and family and have also generated revenue from the beginning   we are very bullish about this year and we think it is going to be the year where we will become a selfsustaining business if we can achieve this milestone we will then determine if we are going to seek more capital this year to accelerate our reach i think that is one of the key decisions that are going to play itself out this year   ceocfo are there tweaks you would like to do or additional data you would like to add dr ho yes we have many products in our pipeline when we started the company we had a grand ambition to cover pretty much the entire drug development cycle from clinical trials all the way through reimbursement we started with reimbursement and worked our way backwards toward clinical trials because of this approach we have a series of products in the pipeline and we built a platform to sustain a set of products which are both integrated and available separately obviously if we had more capital we would bring many those products to the market a little faster   we are very fortunate that we have been able to work with customers every step of the way to ensure that much what we build is of value to customers from the beginning our deliberate pace of how we have been growing has also won us some very happy users as well   ceocfo why should the business and investment community pay attention to context matters dr ho i think most people have not given the concept of context enough thought especially when it comes to such a complex world as drug development and life sciences in general the concept is much larger than just simply drug development and drug reimbursement it is around the idea that the answer to most questions about value is simply it depends it depends is determined on the context and the question that is being asked for our customers it depends is based on whether you are looking at the value of this drug as determined by one or more countries criteria or if you are basing the value of this drug on its comparators or competition or if you are assessing the value of the drug on the time horizon of development or the comparators at different points in time   context matters has built this thinking into the very core of what we are providing for our customers through our platform our products and our services what we have done is acknowledged that there is an important concept around context that this concept should drive how one views information or how one can change the lens of viewing information every strategic analysis based on evidence starts with asking  if you can take data out of context and if so  can you at the same time render a judgment that you are comfortable with when data is taken out of context   i think the business and investment community should pay attention to us because we are an exciting and growing company that philosophically understands one of the key principles that have bedeviled big data companies and big data efforts we deal with a variety of data value data integrity to the core and have created an application and platform that retains context and allows context to be determined by the user    we are a company to watch out for because we have recognized a critical element for determining relative value and risk and the end result will be a shortened timeline for drug development as the value is understood earlier in the process disclaimers any reproduction or further distribution of this article without the express written consent of ceocfointerviewscom is
