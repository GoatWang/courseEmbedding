with our successful completion of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to  as described in this prospectus these loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination  which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the target business or businesses in our initial business combination or for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account based on current interest rates we would expect approximately  to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor the terms of such loans by our sponsor affiliates of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or its affiliates as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing the nasdaq rules provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations based on current interest rates we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes if any the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support beginning with the closing of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our sponsor may loan us up to an aggregate of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering these loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section  and section  of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholder has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on may   as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses we refer to such a business combination throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering we have not identified any acquisition target we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any acquisition target we have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination we currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses which provide services to the healthcare industry with particular emphasis on businesses that align with several key themes the aging of america and the growing need for better more efficient care for the elderly the shift from feeforservice to value based care payment models and the increasing importance and involvement of consumers in healthcare we are not however required to complete our initial business combination with a healthcare services business and as a result we may pursue a business combination outside of that industry we will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial operational strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value we do not intend to acquire startup companies or companies that are not profitable  our executive offices are located at  east lancaster avenue suite

delaware     date  law firm skadden arps     preview edit  save related documents  of the top  law firms use our products every day   exhibit    indemnity agreement   this indemnity agreement this “ agreement ” is made as of ●  by and between eagle acquisition corp a delaware corporation the “ company ” and ● “ indemnitee ”   recitals   whereas  highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publiclyheld corporations as directors officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of such corporations   whereas  the board of directors of the company the “ board ” has determined that in order to attract and retain qualified individuals the company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis at its sole expense liability insurance to protect persons serving the company and any of its subsidiaries from certain liabilities although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among publicly traded corporations and other business enterprises the company believes that given current market conditions and trends such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions at the same time directors officers and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and timeconsuming litigation relating to among other things matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the company or business enterprise itself the amended and restated certificate of incorporation the “ charter ” and bylaws of the company require indemnification of the officers and directors of the company indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law “ dgcl ” the charter the company’s bylaws and the dgcl expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the company and members of the board of directors officers and other persons with respect to indemnification hold harmless exoneration advancement and reimbursement rights    whereas  the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons   whereas  the board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the company’s stockholders and that the company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future   whereas  it is reasonable prudent and necessary for the company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify hold harmless exonerate and to advance expenses on behalf of such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the company free from undue concern that they will not be so protected against liabilities   whereas  this agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the charter and bylaws of the company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of indemnitee thereunder   whereas  indemnitee may not be willing to serve as an officer or director advisor or in another capacity without adequate protection and the company desires indemnitee to serve in such capacity indemnitee is willing to serve continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the company on the condition that he be so indemnified and   now therefore  in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein and subject to the provisions of the letter agreement dated as of ●  between the company and indemnitee pursuant to the underwriting agreement between the company and the underwriters in connection with the company’s initial public offering the company and indemnitee
