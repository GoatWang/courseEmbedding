oil and natural gas business meet regulatory requirements and industry standards our origins the american petroleum institute traces its beginning to world war i when congress and the domestic oil and natural gas industry worked together to help the war effort at the time the industry included the companies created in  after the courtimposed dissolution of standard oil and the independents  these were companies that had been independent of standard oil  they had no experience working together but they agreed to work with the government to ensure that vital petroleum supplies were rapidly and efficiently deployed to the armed forces the national petroleum war service committee which oversaw this effort was initially formed under the us chamber of commerce and subsequently as a quasigovernmental body after the war momentum began to build to form a national association that could represent the entire industry in the postwar years  the industry’s efforts to supply fuel during world war i not only highlighted the importance of the industry to the country but also its obligation to the public as the original charter shows the american petroleum institute was established on march   to afford a means of cooperation with the government in all matters of national concern to foster foreign and domestic trade in american petroleum products to promote in general the interests of the petroleum industry in all its branches to promote the mutual improvement of its members and the study of the arts and sciences connected with the oil and natural gas industry api offices were established in new york city and the organization focused its efforts in several specific areas advocacy we speak for the oil and natural gas industry to the public congress and the executive branch state governments and the media we negotiate with regulatory agencies represent the industry in legal proceedings participate in coalitions and work in partnership with other associations to achieve our members’ public policy goals statistics the first effort was to develop an authoritative program of collecting industry statistics  as early as  api began to issue weekly statistics beginning first with crude oil production  the report which was shared with both the government and the press was later expanded to include crude oil and product stocks refinery runs and other data api statistics remain one of the most credible sources of industry data and they are used worldwide standardization the second effort was the standardization of oil field equipment  during world war i drilling delays resulted from shortages of equipment at the drill site and the industry attempted to overcome that problem by pooling equipment  the program reportedly failed because there was no uniformity of pipe sizes threads and coupling  thus the new association took up the challenge of developing industrywide standards and the first standards were published in  today api maintains nearly  standards and recommended practices covering all segments of the oil and gas industry to promote the use of safe interchangeable equipment and proven and sound engineering practices taxation the third major area of activity was taxation  initially the efforts included working with the treasury department and congressional committees to develop an orderly logical and easily administered way to tax oil assets  in the s these efforts extended to working state governments  both the federal and state governments tax highways fuels to fund the building of roads and the industry supported tougher laws against tax evasion this led to the formation of the api state petroleum council network api now has offices in  state capitals and represents members in  states all east of the rocky mountains today in late  api made the decision to move its offices to washington dc where we remain today  with more than  corporate members we are one of the countrys largest national trade associations and the only one that represents all aspects of america’s oil and natural gas industry this short history of api is based on the story of the american petroleum institute by leonard m fanning published in  and the american petroleum institute an informal history  –  by stephen p potter published by api in  related topics wells to consumer consumer information energy primers other resources energy
