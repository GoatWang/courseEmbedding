project is considered senior living fund gives investors insider access to these prevetted developments   senior living as an asset class has been historically difficult for average investors to access until now institutional investors and specialized operators have been the primary beneficiaries concentrating on an asset class whose demand has been driven by major demographic trends  now astute individual investors can also capitalize on these trends and earn strong yields in a proven niche   on a national macro level the demographic trends are clear the rapidly aging population is fueling demand for senior living facilities that are in short supply this is the main driver for growth and why senior living has continuously proven to be a strong asset class regardless of the

having the right long term operator is possibly the most critical factor in a project’s success senior living fund only works with long term operators with a track record of successful operation of senior living facilities in multiple states and multiple markets having high quality well respected long term operators is one of the most essential elements in any senior living development premarket
