stock diversification strategies – wilmington trust   investment management wealth planning my business corporate  institutional wealth advisory corporate  institutional research  insights about us investment management singlestock diversification strategies learn how to limit risk and save taxes when diversifying a concentrated stock position a portfolio that is topheavy in one security poses tremendous downside risk so it’s critical to employ diversification strategies these strategies can help an investor hedge monetize and diversify out of a concentrated equity position while deferring capital gains tax each strategy has advantages and disadvantages and selecting the right one for you should involve careful planning with your financial tax and legal advisors many corporate executives directors and officers especially those of fastgrowing companies find themselves in a quandary these days if they own millions of shares in those companies their net worth can be substantial so what’s the downside a portfolio that is topheavy in one security poses tremendous downside risk how then can an executive diversify his or her portfolio in the most effective tax efficient manner here is a brief look at some singlestock diversification strategies to help an investor achieve three goals – to hedge monetize and diversify out of a concentrated equity position while deferring capital gains tax collars collars are types of hedging strategies used to limit the price risk of a stock and permit the investor to participate in further appreciation up to a specific price a collar also allows an investor to monetize— that is borrow against— a concentrated equity position one wellknown type of collar is the zeropremium collar or zerocost collar with this approach “put options” provide protection from a price decline below a specified price and “call options” provide appreciation potential up to a specified price a “put” is a contract that gives an investor the right but not the obligation to sell a certain number of shares at a specified price until a certain date a “call” gives its holder the right but not the obligation to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a predetermined price until a certain date for example if a stock is trading at 0 an investor could simultaneously buy a put option at 0 and sell a call option at  the call strike price is set so that the premium received for the call option will match and therefore cover the cost of the premium that the investor must pay to purchase the put option hence the term “zeropremium collar” the strike price is the price at which the owner of a call can buy the underlying stock or the owner of a put can sell the underlying stock in this scenario if the collar were to expire say after three years the investor would have a floor price of 0 while enjoying a potential price rise to  during a month period another kind of collar is the “incomeproducing collar” it is similar to the zeropremium collar except that it generates income to defray the cost of borrowing against the value of the stock with an incomeproducing collar the net premium received from the sale of a call option after covering the cost of the put option is available for payment to the investor prepaid forward sale a prepaid forward sale may be helpful for investors who wish to create taxdeferred liquidity from a concentrated stock position like collars prepaid forward sales involve the purchase of a put and the sale of a call the difference however is that the put option is usually set at a higher level to allow for greater monetization of an equity position and thus to maximize liquidity a prepaid forward sale is usually a privately negotiated contract with a counterparty in which an investor receives a taxdeferred interestfree upfront payment of up to 0 percent of the value of his or her stock in exchange for selling forward a number of his or her shares at maturity the investor will have the option of settling the contract by delivering stock or cash both collars and prepaid forward sales offer many benefits in addition to those already mentioned investors also retain control of their shares receive dividends and have the possibility of deferring taxes exchange funds the goal of an exchange fund is to allow an investor to shift from a concentrated position to a diversified position without triggering capital gains tax as would be the case if the investor simply sold shares an exchange fund works in a straight forward way investors contribute stock to a limited partnership or limited liability corporation in return they receive partnership units in exchange for their contributed shares which gives them a shared ownership of all securities in the fund to avoid registration with the securities and exchange commission sec exchange funds are offered only to “qualified purchasers” with a net worth of at least  million exchange funds are offered by many major brokerage firms fund companies money managers and banks portfolio managers oversee the funds and decide what assets to hold hence not all shares that are offered are accepted portfolio construction is important because the manager will avoid selling contributed shares for the life of the fund in order to preserve the tax deferral some funds restrict withdrawals and charge withdrawal fees during the first several years after seven years most funds will redeem partnership units with shares of at least  different securities contributed to the fund at this time the cost basis of the contributed shares will be transferred to these securities like any investment exchange funds carry risks nonetheless the risks may be outweighed by the key benefit of such funds – the ability to convert a lowbasis singlestock concentration into a welldiversified portfolio without paying capital gains tax executive diversification and investment trust edit this type of trust also referred to as a blind trust allows executives to diversify their investments through the sale of restricted stock without limiting the timing of the sales to socalled “window periods” which would otherwise put constraints on when stock can be sold window periods are imposed by publicly held companies windows usually begin late each quarter and end a month after a company’s earnings report has been issued window periods are designed to keep insiders from running afoul of securities regulations which prohibit the trading of stock using material nonpublic information about companies with an edit an investor gives a trustee sole authority to decide on the timing of sales all sales are made in accordance with the sec’s rule  and within the parameters of the trust without the insider’s knowledge or participation hence sales may be made at any time even if the executive possesses material nonpublic information about his or her company edits may be used by corporate executives and insiders senior officers directors and anyone owning  percent or more of the company’s outstanding shares there are other ways to diversify concentrated holdings of stock including variations on collars and forwards investment swaps and the issuance of exchangeable equitylinked notes for blocks of appreciated stock each strategy has advantages and disadvantages selecting the
