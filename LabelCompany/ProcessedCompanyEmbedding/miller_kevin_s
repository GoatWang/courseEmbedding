juice ben muessig contributor june   — gatorade® isn’t the only greenish drink that athletes crave a new study indicates that pickle brine could help athletes when they need it most researchers say the juice at the bottom of a pickle jar is more effective at staving off crippling muscle cramps than water to prove the salty premise long believed by some trainers and serious athletes scientists induced toe cramps in male college students after forcing the subjects to bike to the point of mild dehydration the average cramp lasted about two minutes and  seconds the pickle juice company a new study has revealed that pickle brine might be more effective than sports drinks at treating muscle cramps confirming a longstanding assumption in the sports world football players cyclists and triathletes have been sipping dillflavored drinks including bottles of the pickle juice company for years those who downed the brine stopped complaining of cramping within  seconds — about  percent faster than the water drinkers and  percent faster than when they didn’t drink anything at all dr kevin miller the lead author of the study told the times he thinks pickle brine helps cure cramps because it triggers a nerve reaction in fact pickle brine seemed to ease cramp pains so quickly that he doubts it even had time to leave athletes’ stomachs before it started to work instead miller and the other researchers argued that pickle juice might spark some kind of “neurally mediated reflex” that helps give the right cues to misfiring muscles which are thought to cause cramps though the study offers some concrete proof that pickle juice can quickly treat muscle cramps the salty drink is still just a drop in the ocean at major sporting events compared to water and other sports drinks

information department of health nutrition and exercise sciences north dakota state university fargo nd  usa kevincmillerndsuedu running on pickle juice marathoners find a sour solution to muscle cramps by paul morgan dr rick ganzi of holland is an avid marathoner who had a problem when he first started running the grueling mile races  years ago the yearold had a problem with muscle cramps “in my first  marathons i had five or six of them that were destroyed by muscle cramps” he said “i would feel good after about  miles but then something would cramp usually my calf and i would have to stop and stretch before i could continue and then my time would be destroyed “it got so bad that i almost gave up marathon running” then a bodybuilding friend told him that many of the competitors would eat pickles to help them from losing sodium and cramping up ganzi also likes to tell people about a national football league game about  years ago between philadelphia and dallas that was won by the eagles on an extremely hot day  philadelphia didn’t cramp up as much as dallas because the eagles drank several ounces of pickle juice for several days before the game some marathon runners depend on pickle juice to provide the sodium their bodies lose in a long race “so i started drinking pickle juice before a marathon” he said “i didn’t cramp up and i had my best time ever” after drinking the juice for several years he thought that maybe it wasn’t the juice that was keeping him from cramping so he didn’t drink it prior to a race “and i cramped up so that told me there was something to the pickle juice that was helping me out” ganzi said “the juice is a niche market for athletes who do an event for several hours it has a limited role to help people who run marathons ultramarathons mileplus events and ironman triathlons it’s not for the everyday person who works out for an hour or so” when he helped start the grand rapids marathon in  ganzi found a sponsor in golden pickle juice of golden texas ganzi has looked at data about marathon runners who lose a lot of sodium after a race “there was one study that enrolled runners in the boston marathon and what they found was that  percent had low sodium levels when they crossed the finish line and some of them were lifethreateningly low” he said “it’s called hyponatremia” one problem with pickle juice is that some people hate the taste several races have gone to a bettertasting broth with a strong concentration of sodium to help runners ganzi now swears by the juice he recently completed the mile comrades marathon in south africa without having muscle cramps “in a race like that a runner can lose to grams of sodium which is around  percent of your body’s sodium” he said metro health grand rapids marathon when oct
