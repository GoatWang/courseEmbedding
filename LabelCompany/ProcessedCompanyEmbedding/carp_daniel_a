board and chief executive officer of the eastman kodak company of rochester new york one of the leading photoimaging corporations in the world with annual revenues of more than  daniel a carp apwide world photos  billion a careerlong kodak employee he climbed the corporate ladder gradually filling positions in both the united states and abroad before entering the elite circle of top management in  and ascending to the top position carps leadership of kodak was marked by several major initiatives that made him the object of much criticism from some shareholders and financial analysts he was determined to maintain the companys long dominance in consumer photoimaging as the industry passed through a radical transition from traditional photography that is the exposure of chemically treated film to light to filmless digital photography that is the creation of pixels by computer program at the same time he led kodak in a marketing and manufacturing push designed to make the company dominant in the enormous emerging consumer markets of asia especially china where traditional photographic methods are likely to remain the norm in consumer imaging for decades to come a onecompany man daniel carp was born and raised in wytheville virginia a town of about eight thousand located in the southwestern corner of the state in the blue ridge mountain region he attended public schools graduating from george wythe high school in  little is known about his upbringing or family life subjects he chose not to discuss in public an early and steady desire for a career in business is evident in his academic record as a student at ohio university in athens a school known for its broadbased offerings in the liberal arts he chose to pursue a strictly focused bachelor of business administration degree in quantitative analysis which he received in  within months of graduation he secured a job with kodak as a statistical analyst in rochester as an entrylevel executive he continued his studies in business at the rochester institute of technology earning an mba carps long climb through the ranks of big yellow as kodak is sometimes called was a gradual one that can be described in terms of three distinct career periods from  to  he gained handson experience and increasing responsibility in market research business planning marketing management and lineofbusiness management in kodaks us and canadian operations rising through the ranks of middle management to hold such positions as manager of sales for kodak canada and general manager of kodaks consumer electronics division a second phase from  to  was international in character it included stints for carp in highlevel management positions with kodaks divisions in the latin american region – and the european african and middle eastern region – carps success on the world marketing stage in battling kodaks arch rival fuji corporation of japan clearly won the notice of top management and gained him consideration for further advancement in  he began a year as a sloan fellow at the massachusetts institute of technologys sloan school of management where he earned a second graduate degree a master of science in management which served as a credential considered appropriate to the huge corporations highest echelons a third phase in which carp was integrated into kodaks inner circle of top management began in  when he was recalled to rochester from the london regional office and promoted to executive vice president within two years he took the positions of president and chief operating officer of the company and was elected to a seat on the board of directors as well carp became board chairman on january   thus consolidating his position of optimal executive power in the publicly held company his predecessor george fisher in handing over power to carp praised him for his expansive focus on customer needs and his strategic understanding of growth opportunities deutsch june   his quick movement to the top in the late s was attributed to the anomalous position in which the company found itself it was successfully dominating an industry that showed signs of disappearing carp was brought in to save the company from a catastrophe attributable to its own success astride a technological cusp carp was given a mandate to do what he thought necessary to make the venerable company which had launched the mass market for home photography with its brownie camera in  into a stateoftheart imaging corporation capable of achieving similar dominance in the emergent mass market for digital photography carp made his intentions clear within weeks of taking office he noted in an interview with industry week that kodaks founder george eastman had first gained a dominant position for the company by developing new technologies and that he was prepared to follow the founders example r  d research and development is at the core of what is going on in our company probably more so today than at any time in our history he said july   he knew that there would be opposition within the company but promised to be a devils advocate for good ideas whether or not they made it through the corporate bureaucracy according to carp once an idea had proved viable to him it is incumbent on the ceo to find a new way to take it to the marketplace july   in the broadest sense the idea that carp had to take to the marketplace was digital photography from pictures to pixels though kodak claims to have invented the digital camera in  the company did little to capitalize on it for almost two decades when carp became ceo kodak had just completed a record year for traditional silverhalide film production manufacturing more than one billion rolls in  and utterly dominating the us market with more than a twothirds share of retail sales while filmless digital photography accounted for only about  percent of the american homeimaging market carp however saw past those figures to the belief that a mass public switch from filmbased to digital photography was inevitable given kodaks heavy investment in the former the company had no choice in his view but to change its core business to meet the demands of this paradigm shift in home imaging his experience in marketing was likely a factor in this vision whatever else can be said about the two imaging processes digital offers more convenience to the consumer as well as lower cost at just about every step digital requires no purchase of film nor does it require the time or expense of a developing process instead consumers can view images on a personal computer or other video screen that they probably already own if traditional photographic finished products are desired the digital photographer has the option to print or to choose not to unlimited numbers of free electronic copies can be produced and delivered by email at no expense for many households already equipped with a personal computer digital photography is the logical choice longtime kodak executives including some who had weathered the storms of previous technology fads notably the polaroid instant picture remained skeptical there was even less enthusiasm from those investors more interested in shortterm profits than in seeing the company go through an expensive retooling process to become a primarily digital company a process that carp estimated could cost as much as  billion carp faced the enormous task of keeping the company astride both sides of this technological cusp in home imaging even though he had no doubt about the eventual outcome of the struggle between the two technologies while he was eager to capitalize on the value of the companys history and reputation as the leading force in home imaging he put sentimentality about the past aside lest the company be perceived as a doddering old behemoth trapped in a sunset industry for example while kodak continued to manufacture hundreds of millions of rolls of film each year the company gradually phased out the use of its kodachrome film brand in advertising so as not to be identified as a predigital vendor by consumers switching to digital cameras carp liked to describe the change in his industry as an exciting opportunity rather than a threat kodak is convinced that there has never been a better time to be in the picture business… digital can change the way people take and use pictures suddenly there are no boundaries to how often you can take pictures because cost and availability are no longer issues he said in a  speech to the advance digital photography forum in boston april   rather than wait for the public to make the leap carp believed that kodak should be a driving force in bringing about consumer conversions to digital though the price of kodak shares suffered and the value of its dividends to shareholders dropped precipitously carp mobilized the company to implement his digitalization program before  kodak did not have a digital business to report on by the end of  it was doing one billion dollars per year of business in digital products and services including its online photofinishing site ofotocom in addition to manufacturing its own lines of digital cameras and homeprinter docks kodak emerged as the worlds leading supplier of paper stocks photofinishing products and other materials used for commercial and home digitalimage printing carp struck up corporate partnerships to capitalize on the power of the kodak brand lexmark for example licensed the kodak name for a line of its scanners and printers sanyo electric company and kodak launched a joint venture to manufacture activematrix organic lightemitting diode display screens in the growing area of medical and dental imaging kodak worked on a variety of projects with ge medical systems retailing partners were outfitted with doityourself kodak picture kiosks and professional digital minilabs that can conveniently scan traditional pictures into digital documents and and convert digital shots into elegantly printed hard copy one of carps first decisions as ceo was to have kodak join the international imaging industry association iiia whose members included fuji and agfagevaert its two biggest worldwide competitors kodak then entered into an iiia agreement providing for industrywide compatibility of digitalimaging products kodaks movement from laborintensive photographic equipment manufacturing to the serviceoriented digital imaging industry occasioned sharp reductions in its workforce in january  carp announced that kodak would be cutting between  and  percent of its worldwide employees leader of a worldwide company while the digitalization of kodaks consumer imaging business was the centerpiece of carps strategy it was by no means his entire plan for kodak emerging industrial societies such as china and india where home computers were rare and digital cameras too expensive for all but the wealthy had large populations of newly urbanized consumers who had never owned a camera or taken a photograph these countries represented an enormous potential market for traditional photochemical imaging precisely the product line that kodak had been delivering best for more than a century in  carp journeyed to china and cemented ties between the company and chinese leaders carp served as a member of the uschina business council and joined the advisory board of the tsinghua university school of economics and management kodak which did business in china before the communist revolution of  reentered the chinese market through its purchase of a stake in lucky film chinas largest film company it provided technological and marketing assistance to lucky film in creating a line of entrylevel cameras and film products as consumers graduate to more advanced equipment they are sold products bearing the kodak brand name in  china became kodaks second largest market after the us in terms of gross sales carp wanted kodak to be there when china was ready to make the leap to digital carp was a strong and vocal advocate for diversity in the workplace his hiring of patricia f russo as his second in command at kodak in april  was unprecedented at kodak long considered an old boy company he was a trustee of the george eastman house the rochester photography museum endowed by kodaks founder a trustee of the malcolm baldridge foundation national quality award a member of the board of directors of africare and a member of the business roundtable he served on the business steering committee of the global business dialog on electronic commerce and was an executive member of the world business council for sustainable development he was known to enjoy watching and playing basketball asked by the rochester democrat and chronicle how he felt about being in charge of making such radical changes in the company he had been with for most of his life he said i am excited about this being on my watch i wouldnt want to be anywhere else i am glad i am here doing this its a relief that it is now obvious where the film business is going and we can get on with what we have to do to make the company stronger october   see
