hedgecovestindividual investors registered investment advisors family offices resources login home  articles charlie frumberg emancipation management march th  charlie frumberg emancipation management emancipation management llc is an sec registered new york based investment manager formed in june  the company has a  year track record of identifying public companies within the technology sector that possess valuable franchises which are mispriced by the market emancipation has been successful in effecting board or management change identifying necessary expense reductions improving inefficient capital structures andor initiating a sale process we were able to sit down with portfolio manager and founder charlie frumberg recently to discuss the company’s ideologies hedgecovest welcome charlie thanks for taking the time to sit down with us charlie frumberg you’re welcome happy to do it hedgecovest looking at the overview for the emancipation longshort equity model on the hedgecovest platform the first thing that jumped out at me was the fact that you are focused on the tech sector if you would describe the investment philosophy you use to invest in the tech sector cf we believe that there are inefficiencies inherent in the tech sector where investors overlook certain stocks we look for businesses that stay within strict parameters the things we are looking for are enterprise value recurring revenues and ebitda or cash flow stocks go through phases where they are sought after because they are considered a growth stock and then eventually the money flowing in and out of the stock not the company starts to change perhaps it is being reclassified into a value stock when these shifts occur the valuations change and they create pricing inefficiencies hedgecovest it sounds like you see the investors changing as the stock moves out of the growth phase and in to a value phase which changes how investors perceive the stock cf that is exactly right as the company matures and moves out of the growth stock classification there seems to be a period where they don’t attract growth investors or value investors hedgecovest i would think as a stock gets reclassified like this it would create a lot of institutional trading a growth oriented mutual fund isn’t interested in the stock anymore and it isn’t on the radar of the value oriented mutual funds yet either doesn’t that wreak havoc on the valuations and money flows from institutions cf it does and that is why we tend to shy away from the turmoil we want to wait until the dust settles and then evaluate the company using the items we talked about before enterprise value recurring revenue and cash flow hedgecovest can you give me an example of a stock that has gone through the phases cf microsoft is a great example it was considered a growth stock in the late s and it had returns to fit then from  until  the stock moved sideways for the most part it dipped with the overall market in  it was now classified more as a value stock but from the bottom in  until recently the stock tripled in value the company is a mature business now and it attracts a different group of investors hedgecovest i would think apple would fit this scenario as well cf  absolutely we have invested in apple several times over the years and taken gains each time the stock was languishing for the first four years of this century as it was considered a value stock but then with the ipods iphones and ipads being so successful the stock went back in to the growth stock classification and it has gone up fold in the last six or seven years and that reclassification is something we look for we asked ourselves can the stock get reclassified hedgecovest it sounds like almost all of your analysis is based on fundamental analysis is that accurate cf  we look at everything but the core of what we do is definitely centered around fundamental analysis hedgecovest it sounds like you using the fundamentals to decide what to buy and then using technical analysis as a way to determine when to buy am i interpreting that right cf that’s a fair way of putting it we try to be market agnostic in an informed way we are driven mainly by the number of candidates that appear on our screens that in turn forms our overall market opinion if we see a huge list of stocks that meet our criteria which are pretty strict it usually is a sign that the market is undervalued conversely if we see very few names on our screens it is likely that we are hitting a top or that a rally is losing its steam hedgecovest so in march  i assume you were seeing lots of names on your bullish screens whereas right now after six years of a bull market i am guessing you aren’t seeing as many names on the list cf that’s a great point  is a great example for us we made it through  alive and in the early part of  it reminded me of the shift in  when there were so many stocks on our bullish list that it seemed like it was raining stocks we reordered the entire book in early  and became very long biased it turned out to be our best year ever your example is a very good one and a very relevant one to us now in markets that are rising the average can sometimes mask a lot of damage underneath but what we have found in the last run here is that there has been a lot of injected capital and liquidity looking for a home there are still lots of names that meet our criteria they just aren’t the best performing names at this time the indices are a little top heavy right now but there are value opportunities out there hedgecovest is there a market environment that you feel the strategy is less effective or will underperform the overall market cf purely gogo markets where investors will pay anything for growth multiples don’t matter cash flows don’t matter the late s is the type of market where we are most likely to lag or the most difficult type of market for us hedgecovest what does the typical construction of the portfolio look like cf we are generally looking at  names in the long book in the long portfolio we will have a higher concentration in our top five ideas or our core holdings and the rest would divided out pretty evenly among the other  names and we do limit the exposure to one stock or idea to  in the short book we typically carry  names in there with the average allocation being  on average hedgecovest if your screens are showing few names are meeting your criteria for going long or the potential for a bearish swing in the market would you increase the allocations to the bearish names cf no we would keep them in the  range we would just add more names to increase the short exposure as a whole hedgecovest  what do you see as the strengths of the strategy cf it is noncorrelated to the overall market because we tend to invest in lower beta stocks these lower beta stocks tend to hold up better in a down market i think another strength is that we are unique in the way we invest in the tech sector most tech funds are looking for growth stocks where we are looking for value stocks within the sector and that makes for a very unique portfolio hedgecovest what do you see as the weaknesses cf like i said before we aren’t going to perform as well in real gogo market lower beta stocks are not going to move up as much as high beta or growthtype stocks hedgecovest are you more heavily invested in large cap names as the result of looking for stocks that have matured from the growth phase to the value phase cf originally we found most of our opportunities in the smallcap area over time we were finding as many opportunities in the midcap and largecap realms today the holdings could be from any of the three categories but the majority are still in the small and midcap areas hedgecovest how often is the portfolio rolled over cf on an annual basis it is probably right around  but the breakdowns are very different we roll over the short book far more frequently than the long book within the long book we have the core holdings and then we have the noncore holdings the noncore holdings are rolled over more than the core holdings but not as often as the short positions so if you ordered them from most actively traded to least actively traded it would be short book noncore holdings then core holdings hedgecovest i just have one more question for you what was it that made you join the hedgecovest platform cf like most managers we were looking for new revenue streams and we felt like hedgecovest was a good opportunity for that it also gives us a mean of reaching investors that we couldn’t previously we also liked the uniqueness of the idea of hedgecovest there isn’t anything else out there like it hedgecovest we think it is unique as well and it is
