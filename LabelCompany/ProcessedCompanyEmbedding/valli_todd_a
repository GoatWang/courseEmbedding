american rock and pop band that became internationally successful in the s and s the vocal group hall of fame has stated that the group was the most popular rock band before the beatles since  they have also been known at times as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update

he and guitarist tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles and albums on an occasional basis but after grease only a remixed version of their biggest seller december  would visit the upper half of the hot  in  in january  warners released frankie valli  the four seasons reunited live produced by bob gaudio it was a double album of concert recordings which included the two studio recordings spend the night in love and heaven must have sent you here in the night sung by valli the latter became a uk single but failed to chart while the former was released as a single in america inching its way into the hot  in  a longawaited collaboration between the four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the latest edition of the four seasons including valli conducted a north american tour in the latter half of  incidental to this tour the massive cd  dvd box set jersey beat the music of frankie valli  the  seasons was released in mid marketed as the most comprehensive collection of four seasons music yet the album title jersey beat is a play on jersey boys a wildly successful broadway musical about the four seasons as well as on mersey beat a term first coined as the title of a music magazine published in liverpool uk from  but subsequently also used to describe liverpools beat music culture of the early s in  the four seasons beggin was revived by not one but two acts pilooski made an electro remix of that song while rap act madcon used it as the basis of their song beggin the latter went to number  in the uk charts and was a hit across europe the song was featured in a tv commercial for adidas

the group was the most popular rock band before the beatles since  they have also been known at times as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update the four seasons original group members  to september  were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in  and joined the vocal

commercial release was my mothers eyes as frankie valley in  the following year he and guitarist tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles and albums on an occasional basis but after grease only a remixed version of their biggest seller december  would visit the upper half of the hot  in  in january  warners released frankie valli  the four seasons reunited live produced by bob gaudio it was a double album of concert recordings which included the two studio recordings spend the night in love and heaven must have sent you here in the night sung by valli the latter became a uk single but failed to chart while the former was released as a single in america inching its way into the hot  in  a longawaited collaboration between the four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the latest edition of the four seasons including valli conducted a north american tour in the latter half of  incidental to this tour the massive cd  dvd box set jersey beat the music of frankie valli  the  seasons was released in mid marketed as the most comprehensive collection of four seasons music yet the album title jersey beat is a play on jersey boys a wildly successful broadway musical about the four seasons as well as on mersey beat a term

hall of fame has stated that the group was the most popular rock band before the beatles since  they have also been known at times as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update the four seasons original group members  to september  were inducted into the rock and roll hall of

frankie vallis first commercial release was my mothers eyes as frankie valley in  the following year he and guitarist tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles and albums on an occasional basis but after grease only a remixed version of their biggest seller december  would visit the upper half of the hot  in  in january  warners released frankie valli  the four seasons reunited live produced by bob gaudio it was a double album of concert recordings which included the two studio recordings spend the night in love and heaven must have sent you here in the night sung by valli the latter became a uk single but failed to chart while the former was released as a single in america inching its way into the hot  in  a longawaited collaboration between the four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the latest edition of the four seasons including valli conducted a north american tour in the latter half of  incidental to this tour the massive cd  dvd box set jersey beat the music of frankie valli

that became internationally successful in the s and s the vocal group hall of fame has stated that the group was the most popular rock band before the beatles since  they have also been known at times as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update the four seasons original group

tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles and albums on an occasional basis but after grease only a remixed version of their biggest seller december  would visit the upper half of the hot  in  in january  warners released frankie valli  the four seasons reunited live produced by bob gaudio it was a double album of concert recordings which included the two studio recordings spend the night in love and heaven must have sent you here in the night sung by valli the latter became a uk single but failed to chart while the former was released as a single in america inching its way into the hot  in  a longawaited collaboration between the four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the

as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update the four seasons original group

tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles

four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the

that became internationally successful in the s and s the vocal group hall of fame has stated that the group was the most popular rock band before the beatles since  they have also been known at times as frankie valli and the four seasons in  the group known as the four lovers evolved into the four seasons with frankie valli as the lead singer bob gaudio formerly of the royal teens on keyboards and tenor vocals tommy devito on lead guitar and baritone vocals and nick massi on electric bass and bass vocals the legal name of the organization is the four seasons partnership formed by gaudio and valli taken after a failed audition in  while singers producers and musicians have come and gone gaudio and valli remain the groups constant with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets including virtually all of its recording catalog gaudio no longer plays live leaving valli the only member of the group from its inception who is touring as of update the four seasons original group

tommy devito formed the variatones with hank majewski rhythm guitar frank cattone accordion and billy thompson drums which between  and  performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name the four lovers the same year the quartet released their first record youre the apple of my eye which appeared on the billboard hot  singles chart peaking at  five additional four lovers singles on rca victor were released over the next year with virtually no sales airplay or jukebox play in  the groups seventh single this time on epic had a similar lack of success from  until  the group stayed together performing in clubs and lounges as the four lovers and recording on various record labels with various names frankie tyler frankie valley frankie valley and the travelers frankie valley and the romans the village voices and the topics are some of the  stage names used individually or collectively by the members of the group in  charles calello replaced nick massi on bass in the lineup in  the group started working with producersongwriter bob crewe primarily for session work crewe wrote i go ape which valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a solo single later that year the four lovers were performing in baltimore on the same stage as the royal teens who were riding the wave of success of short shorts a song cowritten by thenyearold bob gaudio who was also the royal teens keyboardist in late  gaudio was added to the four lovers on keyboards and guitar as a replacement for rhythm guitarist hank majewski early the following year nick massi returned to replace calello who remained the bands musical arranger in  despite the changes of personnel the fortunes of the four lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a union township union county new jersey bowling establishment according to gaudio we figured well come out of this with something so we took the name of the bowling alley it was called the four seasons despite the last few years of frustration of the four lovers this proved to be the turning point for the group later on a handshake agreement between keyboardistcomposer bob gaudio and lead singer frankie valli the four seasons partnership was formed the rise of the four seasonsedit the four seasons signed as artists to crewes production company and they released their first creweproduced single under their new name in  bermudaspanish lace on gone records the single did not chart the group continued working with producer bob crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different group names for productions on crewes own topix label as a followup bob gaudio wrote a song that after some discussion between crewe and gaudio was titled sherry after the song was recorded crewe and the members of the group solicited record labels to release it it was frankie valli who spoke with randy wood west coast sales manager for veejay records not the founder of dot records who in turn suggested the release of sherry to the decision makers at veejay sherry made enough of an impression that crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and veejay for its release they were the first white artists to sign with veejay in  the group released their first album featuring the single sherry which was not only their first charted hit but also their first numberone song under the guidance of bob crewe the four seasons followed up sherry with several millionselling hits generally composed by crewe and gaudio including big girls dont cry their second  hit walk like a man their third  candy girl aint that a shame and several others in addition they released a christmas album in december  and charted with a unique rendition of santa claus is coming to town from  to early  the beach boys were the only band to match the four seasons in record sales in the united states and their first three veejay nonholiday single releases ie ignoring their version of santa claus is coming to town marked the first time that a rock band hit  on the billboard singles charts with three consecutive entries in  they were invited to perform their hit big girls dont cry on the show american bandstand from veejay to philipsedit the four seasons in  despite the groups success veejay records was in financial distress the label had released several early beatles singles in america when the beatles became wildly popular veejay was swamped with orders and they shipped more than two million beatles records in a single month the huge demands of mass production the cashflow problems involved and the loss of the beatles when transglobal a firm licensed by emi to distribute its products canceled veejays contract on august   due to nonpayment of royalties found veejay hardpressed to stay afloat veejay continued to produce one beatles album in various forms in defiance of the cancellation after over a year of legal negotiations capitol records was finally able to stop veejay effective october   while the label went through internal turmoil with the beatles and capitol records a separate royalty dispute between veejay and the four seasons headed to court in january  after several successful albums but a lack of money from veejay the seasons left veejay and moved to philips records then a division of mercury records in the  settlement of the lawsuit veejay retained release rights for all material the group recorded for the label veejay exercised those rights liberally over the following year the group was obligated to deliver one final album to veejay which they did in the form of a faux live lp when veejay was finally declared bankrupt in  the four seasons veejay catalog reverted to the band to settle unpaid royalties and the tracks were then reissued by philips the change of label did not diminish the popularity of the four seasons in  nor did the onslaught of the british invasion and beatlemania however dawn go away recorded for atlantic records but never released by them was kept from the  spot on the hot  by no fewer than three beatles singles in the march   edition two weeks later the top five slots were filled by beatles singles in a tworecord set dubbed the beatles vs the four seasons the international battle of the century veejay created an elaborate twodisc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist the discs were reissues of the albums introducing the beatles and golden hits of the four seasons featuring each original albums label title and catalog number today this album package is a collectors item one group several actsedit nick massi left the four seasons in september  the groups arranger charles calello a former member of the four lovers stepped in as a temporary replacement a few months later joe long was permanently hired and became a mainstay of the group on bass and backing vocals until  with calello returning to arranging in the meantime the four seasons released recordings under a variety of names including the valli boys the wonder who and frankie valli every valli solo recording from  to my eyes adored you in  was recorded by the four seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as other four seasons material vallis first post single without the seasons was s swearin to god more top  singles followed in   and  including lets hang on dont think twice its all right as the wonder who working my way back to you opus  dont you worry bout me ive got you under my skin cant take my eyes off you released under vallis name as a solo single beggin tell it to the rain cmon marianne and i make a fool of myself frankie valli solo in addition other crewegaudio songs that did not become hits for either valli or the four seasons became international hits in cover versions such as silence is golden the tremeloes and the sun aint gonna shine anymore the walker brothers however s will you love me tomorrow was the groups last top  hit for seven years reaching  just after vallis last solo hit of the s the  charted to give the reason i live the end of the s and move to motownedit by  the groups popularity had deteriorated as public interest moved towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics aware of that bob gaudio partnered with folkrock songwriter jake holmes to write a concept album titled the genuine imitation life gazette which discussed contemporary issues from the groups standpoint as men in their thirties including issues such as divorce saturdays father and kinksstyle satirical looks at modern life eg american crucifixion and resurrection mrs statelys garden genuine imitation life the album cover was designed to resemble a newspapers front page predating jethro tulls thick as a brick by several years however the album was a commercial failure although it did catch the attention of frank sinatra whose  album watertown was also done by gaudio holmes and calello however this new direction led to groups departure from philips shortly thereafter the seasons last single on philips s patch of blue featured the groups name as frankie valli  the four seasons but the change in billing did not alter the acts lack of success reverting to the four seasons billing without vallis name up front the group issued a single on crewes eponymous label and that reminds me which got as high as number  on the billboard chart after leaving philips the four seasons recorded a oneoff single for the warner brothers label in england john stefan the bands lead trumpeter had arranged the horn section parts for these recordings this single was never released in the usa the songs were sleeping man backed with whatever you say following that single the group signed to motown the first lp chameleon failed to sell after it was released by motown subsidiary label mowest records in  a frankie valli solo single from  love isnt here on motown and three four seasons singles walk on dont look back on mowest in  how come and hickory on motown in  sank without a trace a song from chameleon that was later to become a northern soul hit and reach the top  of the uk singles chart the night was not commercially released as a single by motown in the united states after promotional copies showing the artist as frankie valli were distributed in  in late  and early  the four seasons recorded eight songs for a planned second motown album which the company refused to release to the public later in  the record label and the band parted ways on behalf of the four seasons partnership valli initially tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for motown upon hearing the amount needed to buy them all valli arranged to purchase one recording for  us my eyes adored you valli took the tape to private stock records owner and founder larry uttal who after repeated listenings of the four seasons recording wanted to release it as a frankie valli solo single while the group remained unsigned in the later part of  valli had a new label—and a new solo career resurgenceedit while the hits for the four seasons had dried up in the first half of the s the group never lost its popularity as a performing act longtime member joe long stayed in the group until  the new lineup boasted two new lead singers in don ciccone formerly of the critters and gerry polci who eased the singing load on an ailing frankie valli who was gradually losing his hearing due to otosclerosis though eventually surgery restored most of it as my eyes adored you climbed the hot  singles chart in early  valli and gaudio managed to get the four seasons signed with warner bros records as the disco era dawned at the same time uttal was persuaded to release the four seasons story a tworecord compilation of the groups biggest hit singles from  to  it quickly became a gold record selling over one million copies before the riaa started awarding platinum records for millionselling albums in  record sales exploded for both valli and the four seasons as both acts had millionselling singles in the united states my eyes adored you hit  on the hot  for valli in march who loves you peaked at  in november for the group in the united kingdom tamla motown released the night as a single and saw it reach the  position on the uk singles chart my eyes adored you was also a top  hit in the united kingdom in february of that year valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of  when the bob creweproduced swearin to god followed my eyes adored you into the upper reaches of the hot  peaking at the  position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze the song was released in three forms the eightminute album version the tenminute extended inch single version and the fourminute single version this record featured patti austin on bridge vocals before she became wellknown valli followed this with a discofied  hit version of ruby  the romantics our day will come also featuring austin the album who loves you became a surprise millionseller for the group as it was the first four seasons album to prominently feature lead vocals by anyone other than valli sorry on half  half had featured gaudio devito and long minus valli while wall street village day on genuine imitation life gazette featured valli on just a couple of bridge section lead vocal lines gerry polci did about half of the lead vocals sharing them with valli and one lead by ciccone slip away the title song had valli doing the lead on the verses but none of the trademark falsettos in the chorus it was a top  british hit in october  relaunching their career there the four seasons opened  atop the billboard chart with their fifth  single december  oh what a night cowritten by bob gaudio and his future wife judy parker the single also hit number one in the united kingdom december  oh what a night had polci singing lead on the verses ciccone featured on specific sections and valli doing lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus although the band also scored minor chart placements with silver star with valli on harmony vocals  in  and down the hall  in  both sung by polci and spend the night in love  in  which again featured polci as main lead vocalist and valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals december  marked the end of the seasons hitmaking run both singles were hits in the united kingdom with silver star making the top  a dance remix version of december  returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the billboard singles charts almost two decades later after discoedit the success of who loves you increased the popularity of the four seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit but when s helicon album was released by warner bros the climate was changing again both for the group and for valli the new record yielded only one usa single down the hall which limped onto the hot  in the uk they had chart hits with both down the hall and rhapsody with verses sung by don ciccone and valli appearing to notable effect only as lead voice over group harmonies on the chorus at the same time vallis string of solo hits had come to an end as he parted ways with private stock records helicon saw polci and ciccone heavily featured as lead vocalists valli besides his colead chorus vocal on rhapsody and some backing vocals only taking a brief bridge lead vocal on two songs that were largely sung by polci though on new york street song no easy way valli also clearly stands out over the group harmonies on two notable a cappella sections plus valli took one solo lead vocal role on the albums concluding song the brief gaudioparkerpenned i believe in you excluding vallis  grease single which hit  while the motion picture of the same name became the highestgrossing musical in cinematic history the last top  hit for the group was behind them both valli and the group released singles

four seasons and the beach boys east meets west was released on fbi records owned by the four seasons partnership which included most of the surviving beach boys including brian wilson however the record did not sell well even after the rise and fall of the groups sales in the disco era the four seasons in one version or another the group became a sextet as jerry corbetta formerly of sugarloaf joined the lineup continued to be a popular touring act with valli being the only constant in the midst of a fluctuating lineup although gaudio is still officially part of the group he and valli are still equal partners in the four seasons partnership he now restricts his activities to writing producing and the occasional studio work in august  mca records released the group album streetfighter which yielded two singles in the title track and book of love a postdiscostyle revamp of the monotones  recording in september  a group album was released entitled hope  glory on the mcacurb label the

families who needed help even though sometimes they struggled themselves alfredo presta came to america like many italian immigrants looking for opportunity and a better life then they left behind in the farming town of valli he held several jobs in america but he always knew his true calling was in retail produce alfredo possessed instinctive business abilities without any formal education or
