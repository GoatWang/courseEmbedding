rustall product review by thomas knapp   rustall reviewby thomas knapp by thomas knapp mmr  rust rŭst any of various powdery or scaly reddishbrown or reddishyellow hydrated ferric oxides formed on iron and ironcontaining materials by lowtemperature oxidation in the presence of water any of various metallic coatings especially oxides formed by corrosion a stain or coating resembling iron rust e xcept for brand new like in…today… or freshly backshopped equipment virtually all railway equipment has some rust dirt and other deposits on it resulting from use and exposure to the elements railroad equipment manufacturers owners and operators all try to prevent this with varying levels of effort and with varying degrees of successodel railroaders call it “weathering” and love it when weathering equipment it is important to understand the cause of the weathering and the direction from whence it comes soot on locomotive skylines and roofs emanates from stacks settles down on top of horizontal surfaces and its area of accumulation extends back along the equipment by virtue of the equipment’s generally forward motion calcium and other contaminants borne by feed water or steam generally flow down from the source as the steam condenses on the outer surface of the metal jacket of domes cylinders and pumps metal surfaces that experience high heat cycles which burn off paint or other surface protection such as smokeboxes fireboxes and firebox stay bolts will have surface rust water may tend to accumulate at seams and joints in horizontal metal surfaces such as around water hatches on tenders or on side tanks with resulting rust riveted joints in water tanks will often show rust deposits around the head of the rivet either from the accumulation of external water or from seeping at the rivet lubricating oils and grease – although not “weathering”  will leave deposits – sometimes shiny – on metal surfaces dirt thrown up by the movement of equipment through the environment will accumulate on running gear and sometimes the lower sides of equipment freight equipment is not only subject to many of these same weathering impacts but also the materials they are subject to handling or processes associated with those materials from the lye used to sanitize stock cars to coal dust to … well… you get the idea another condition which is lumped into “weathering” is the fading and oxidation of painted surfaces due to sunlight and exposure to the air see sidebar speaking of oxidation back to the main subject of this article – rust to paraphrase a definition from wikipedia “rust is a general term for a series of iron oxides colloquially the term is applied to red oxides formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture  rust consists of hydrated iron oxides feo·nho and iron oxidehydroxide feooh feoh  given sufficient time oxygen and water any iron mass eventually converts entirely to rust and disintegrates” now we usually don’t want our model railway equipment to disintegrate but we do want to try and realistically capture the look of rust – whether it is minor and incidental rust on an otherwise wellmaintained piece of equipment or that terminal rust that is the precursor to the eventual disintegration of wrecked and abandoned metal junk modelers creatively portray rust using several methods not all methods “scale down” successfully to nscale techniques such as drybrushing with rustcolored paints besides being one of the less “controllable” techniques tends to hit the high portions of model surfaces such as the tops of rivets etc chalks have the same problem although they are more controlled and can be worked down to settle into recesses however the best method i have found to duplicate rust from minor to major is a liquid product called rustall  wwwrustallcom  this product comes in a fourpart kit and can be applied to anything – metal styrene wood paper your fingers although the later is not recommended by the author – and will produce a realistic and finely grained or coarse and crumbly rust texture a major model supply company has recently come out with a “copycat” product which i have tried and discarded – in my opinion the color and consistency of the “rust” is not as good as the original the key component of the four parts is a “rust” solution which is thin and fluid and is applied in layers building up the rust to the level desired it flows readily across a model surface and collects around the edges of rivets in seams and at abrupt changes in panels – in the same way water would collect on metal and gradually oxidize the metal into rust the kit also includes a black solution which can be applied to surfaces to collect in recesses in much the same way and bring out detail the third part of the kit is a “dead flat” sealer coat and the fourth part is an optional very finely ground dirt with some clay in it which can be dusted onto surfaces to well  represent “dirt” it also can be used in combination with the other parts to create very coarse crumbly rust effects in larger scales although with care you can also use it this way in n as will be seen in a couple of examples in this article if you use one of the components up replacements bottle of each of the individual components are available the instructions both printed and online described the simple fourstep process slosh on the rust solution  when dry apply a coat of the back solution  seal with a coat of “dead flat”  dust with dirt  it is pretty foolproof the unique property of these components which sets them apart from other ways of simulating rust is the controllability of results solutions  and  deposit small thin layers of their rusting and blackening ingredients allowing the modeler to control the degree and location of rusting also if you don’t like the result you can easily remove it with alcohol for this article i have prepared examples representing degrees from very minor rust deposits which might be found on well maintained equipment to significant rust on stillinservice equipment to crumbly flaking rust on scrap or abandoned equipment the stepbystep photo examples are supplemented by vignettes of completed models illustrating the modeling of different rust effects i selected a variety of metal castings of industrial equipment as an example of how to “rust” old equipment photo  i mounted these castings on a plastic card using doublestick tape then gave all a base coat of floquil weathered black see sidebar before the undercoat dried the singlecylinder horizontal steam engine and one of the modern boiler fronts were given a sprinkling of the dirt in  while the sides of the air compressor tank received a very fine dusting of  when the undercoat had dried the castings were then given multiple coats of solution  photo  when i was satisfied with the amount of “rust” on the parts i applied the blackening solution  the results of the “rusting” are show in the group portrait photo  the different effects are clearly seen in the comparison of the lathe photo  or the erie steam hammer photo  which have surface rust to the flaking scale on the air compressor tank photo  this is also clear in the two different effects represented on the modern gas boiler fronts photo  one of which represents a recently rusted perhaps still functioning boiler the other which is clearly beyond redemption the rust deposits and blackener can also work on painted parts such as the three red oil drums photo  for the ” gauge ore car in photo  i applied an additional thinned coat of weathered black to the inside of the car after rusting and sprinkled more  inside most of my railway equipment is weathered to represent well used aging – sometimes second hand as in the case of a lot of pacific coast railway equipment – but still roadworthy equipment photo  shows typical rust deposits on the top of a tender where excess water from filling the tender has accumulated and caused minor surface rust the side tank on the t in photo  has minor rust around the heads of the tank rivets and on the top of the tank at the filler both of these represent a single application of rustall solution  contrast this with the saddle tank t in photo  which represents a roughly treated locomotive two areas where even wellmaintained steam locomotives with any service time will show rust are the smokebox and firebox the smokebox in photo  is an example of surface rust on the smokebox of an inservice well weathered but not derelict road engine likewise photo  shows the firebox of an inservice k as a nonsteam example the narrow gauge center cab diesel in the photo  was weathered to represent an industrial or contractorowned switcher which is showing its age but is still a serviceable workhorse in this case the rust deposits represent surface rust on painted sheet metal light applications were allowed to gather at the edges of surfaces and in recesses such as louvers and the edges of access doors modern railway equipment is perhaps even more subject to a lack of cosmetic maintenance than period equipment or perhaps it is modern color schemes show more than vintage schemes whether it is because equipment strays so far from home in modern interchange or the simple realities of lifecyclecostanalysis on maintenance programs a lot of modern freight rolling stock looks “old before its years” not having any modern standard gauge equipment i bought a red caboose fmc covered hopper lettered for cook industries for this howto example although not an ideal candidate as it is not painted but raw plastic molded in the finish colors photos  and  show the car and trucks before applying the rustall weathering regime the first step is to slosh on some of solution  photo  on one side at a time to control the direction the solution flows move on to another face only after the one you just did dries since this is intended to represent a car in active interchange service one application on each face was all that was necessary compare photo  to photo  the undersides of railway cars accumulate dirt mud oils and grease thrown up from the track and thrown off by lubricated components such as trucks they quickly lose any semblance of the upper surfaces colors i gave the bottom of the hopper a coat of floquil “foundation” to tone down the “baby blue” of the molded plastic and to provide a base for the weathering to this i applied a coat of rust solution  photo  after the “rust” was dry i applied a coat of “dead flat”  photo  when this first coat was dry i applied a second and – while still wet – sprinkled the wet surfaces with dirt from bottle  using a brush to transfer the material and spread it around photo  the result was a floor crusted with dust and dirt with rust showing through here and there photo  i gave the trucks a coat of master modeler burnt umber photo  then followed with rust solution  photo  and black solution  which settled in recesses and brought out the details photo  the top of the car received washes of solutions  and  as well photo  compare the completed car photo  with the outofthebox car photo  and the detail of the end photo  with the asbought end photo  i think the completed model looks quite realistic in a layout setting photo  rust is not confined to the cars themselves – sometimes the contents have rusted as in the scrap metal load in photo i have also used rustall on road vehicles and structures the pickup on the left in photo  is badly rusted with flaky chunks of rust on the surface while the flatbed in the back has only trace amounts of rust the fuel oil tank in photo  shows rust at the riveted seams in the metal tank and the cast resin scrap pile in photo  was prepared the same way as the industrial equipment castings at the start of this article finally ending this diatribe on rust photo  combines rusted corrugated iron siding a rusty mining ore car and a venerable t all weathered with rustall sidebar “aging” versus “weathering” while ithink the semantics could be debated the real distinction here is a “real world” difference between the degradation of a surface such as happens with rust blistering and peeling paint oxidation of painted surfaces splintering and graining of wood etc and the obscuring of a surface due to build up of other materials such as mud dirt grease etc on the surface of the base material as modelers we may use techniques of applying something to the top of a surface to simulate the degradation of the base surface but need to be aware of this real world distinction even relatively clean surfaces will degrade with age and exposure to pollutants in the air and to the fading effects of sunlight before applying surface weathering the base surface should be prepared to represent the “baseline” material condition steam locomotives were commonly painted black observation of builders’ photos of new equipment will show crisp shiny black coats of paint they will also show these shiny black painted locos actually will reflect sky colors tending to mute the black to shades of gray especially on upper surfaces besides being unrealistic in a typical train room or train show setting details on locomotives painted “engine black” tend to get lost there are two schools of thought on “black” locomotives one starts with floquil engine black then follows with an airbrush coat of floquil weathered black then very light drybrush application of light gray to highlight top reflective surfaces this has been the typical way of modeling an oxidized black paint finish in most scales for decades many n scale modelers follow this proven method however on kit and scratchbuilt locomotives which i know i will want to represent as weathered i usually start by airbrushing the entire locomotive floquil weathered black and skip the “undercoat” of engine black then move on to dry brush for “high lights” and then the application of weathering for miscellaneous ironmongery you are weathering and rusting give it a base coat of floquil weathered black of humbrol no  before commencing the “rusting” process  for factory painted equipment with light “aging” effects you may need to do nothing for equipment that has several years’ exposure to the elements one of the most visible effects will be on lettering and on dark painted surfaces there are a variety of ways of “toning down” colors and letteringgraphics one is carefully drybrushing or light air brushing with the background color another is to abrade the surface with something such as a fiberglass scratch brush all the locomotive lettering in the accompanying photos was “aged” using dry brushing of the background color over the lettering and numbers    kuras

blvdsanta monica ca    after being misdiagnosed by three other doctors i finally found out what the problem was when i saw dr knapp with a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain he is the reason i am basically pain free as with his assistant brandi i had nothing bad to say she called me right back and was very helpful with appointments i have nothing bad to say about knapp he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person do not go to knapp i am a pro fighter and a contractor knapp said my arthritis is so bad that i needed a reverse shoulder replacement he said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cufftendens and ligaments i left his office a complete mess i ended up getting four yes  second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis i told each dr what knapp said after they diagnose me and each one saidi have no idea why he said that i can fix your shoulder you dont need a replacement  knapp is not a good dr i actually think hes making money from the replacement manufactures i am happy to say i am scheduled for surgery a good dr and will be back to the gym in nine months dr knapp is a fantastic dr and a world class surgeon i went in to get my right shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport  years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy ive had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about  years ago with dr knapp as well it too has recovered really well hes a pro do not have your surgery done by dr knapp  years after my shoulder surgery i am still in pain every day he did a really bad job he is also very arrogant huge regrets i didnt go to kerlan jobe like i had with my previous shoulder surgery that one is stronger and better than ever what a mistake he also overcharged me and i literally just now   years later  got a reimbursement check so i felt compelled to write on yelp i could almost forgive the other stuff if i didnt still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly i cant believe this guy has such a great reputation happy first day of breast cancer awareness month to me dr knapp is seemingly illequipped and unprofessional in the administration of care in late  i was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to dr knapp by my primary care physician the first visit was great in front of several associates dr knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer he gave me a cortisone shot referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way i guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because hes done anything but this office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment andor insurance verification hes offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which hes supposed to be the nations foremost authority and communication with him outside of the examination room is only via third party you dont speak with dr knapp ever when you get an appointment prepare to wait and if you need paperwork prepare to fight i read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue i wish i could share in that sentiment but i cant i have not yet had surgery wth dr knapp but i did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members they promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what i needed to bring with me to the appointment when i arrived i was first seen by his fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my mri dr knapp ordered another mri but this time with contrast and much to my surprise he actually called me on saturday morning the day he received my mri results because he said i know patients are anxious to hear their results he answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail since then his staff have promptly followed up with me if my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience i will be a happy camper astonishingly badly run office extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone your appointment with dr knapp is mostly run by another dr with knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end a few months ago i had to wait four weeks for knapp to get back to me re my mri when he did it was some girl named brandi who was going to send me for more tests without telling me what knapp had seen in the mri or what my diagnosis was knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run ive ever experienced to be clear i never actually saw dr knapp i was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff they were unsympathetic and completely not helpful one of the nurses brandi scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it she had so much attitude that i hobbled out of the office on my crutches i couldnt bear to stay for the consult its hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors exams and appointments i dont need obstinance from hospital staff i have nothing but great things to say about dr knapp if you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders hes your guy i had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who ive trusted for years i was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to dr knapp prior to this appointment id had  cortisone shots physical therapy chiropractic care massage therapy two mris and was still in pain it turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first mri made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too when i arrived at dr knapps office i did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other yelp reviews the first doc to see me was a fellow who did a preliminary exam prior to dr knapp entering the room this is a very standard procedure that ive experienced in many other dr offices it was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and dr knapp confirmed it it was a rare genetic abnormality once they figured it out i was given a cortisone shot finally in the right place and after it kicked in i was  cured i write this after more than  months just to make sure the shot wasnt going to wear off and the pain was going to come back i am eternally grateful that i saw dr knapp and his staff vs going under the knife with another doctor incision site has not closed up its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus his surgery was done the second week in march we have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages at first dr knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches when that didnt work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment my boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail dr knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up when my boyfriend tried to get in to see dr knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up i guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery but after that they will start to charge the patient again that makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched dr knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit i guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery at this point dr knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him in the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout get in a pool hot tub steam room or sweat in general because of the risk of infection the armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection again dr knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person when he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls when you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office when you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail when you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back when you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but dont after leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from dr knapp one would think a doctor would call his patients back read this warning before you decide to use this doctor i wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing ok i have read all of the reviews i am not a woman so i cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery however i can say that dr knapp called me personally several times post surgery including on the weekends and met with me on a saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery i had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery the comments regarding his assistant brandi are fair i am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte i really didnt appreciate being told to take an advil when clearly i was having a post surgery complication i am recovered and thankful for my choice of dr knapp as a surgeon for me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home after scheduling my appointment a month in advance i gathered all of the materials i needed including my mri report and a dvd of xrays and showed up on time after a  minute wait i was told that the mri films were needed in addition to the complete report that i provided which was normal films for normal reportsreally sounds like a load of crap to me and then as i was trying to get the films emailed over i was told i needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the necessary records then and there nevermind the fact that another patient showed up an hour late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting call me crazy but dont doctors order reports as needed why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing knapp huh i was told when i booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old and that i would need to repeat them which makes me wonder why i was sent off packing before the doctor could make that assessment himself not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway im sure i never had the chance to interact with dr knapp but given how i was treated i will never lay eyes on him if he wants his office to be run by a total insert expletive adjective insert expletive noun then he can be assured hell lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on yelp and elsewhere will grow this office was completely unprofessional and i will make it my lifes mission to ensure that no one i know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done dont know i understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon what i do know is that i routinely waited over  minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing dr knapp he also has the all time record at any drs office in anytime in my life for making me wait  hour and  minutes past my appointment time to see him if it wasnt for a needed post surgical followup i would have left and seen another dr this office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patients the message that their time is not important but the drs time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important dr knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer not only does he have incredible bedside manner just ask him why he wanted to get into medicinehe has such a heart for helping others but you wont be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him i do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery these tools are now used worldwide to change the way that surgeons operate i dont know about you but that to me says alota doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately i went to another doctor who had to make  incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that dr knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only  incisions i wont be going to any one else ever again and as for the wait timeid rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isnt as accurate whats more important to youwait time or your body getting the best care i know what my answer is i really wish i would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with dr knapp i found his office staff and procedures to be condescending rude and narassistic they insisted that i have an mri prior to coming in for the appointment that i bring withme the report and the disk they sent me pages of forms to complete when i arrived the receptioinst ginger scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment when i explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that i wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification she told me firmly no dr knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you she made several other snappy remarks before i was made to wait to see the drs medical assistant once i got in to see the medical assistant she told me that i would need to have an xray before i saw the doctor mind you the doctor had already insisted that i receive an mri test and bring with me the disk and report or he would not see me so he had my mri why did he need an xray now too that was not mentioned previously and why should i have to be exposed to radiation and have my insurance pay for another procdure prior to my even seeing the doctor when i asked to speak with dr knapp the mecial assistnat told me sorry he is very particular and will not talk to you without the xray either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they dont dare risk their job by accomodating a patients reasonable requests or this dr knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients well im sorry but in santa monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as or more important than dr knapps mine included so ill be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere believe me you are far from the only person who ever has had a problem dealing with brandi its too bad shes such a turnoff because knapp is a great orthopedist i love love love dr knapp he is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners he has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients in fact i have used him twice shoulder and knee surgery i went to three doctors regarding my shoulder and they all stated i needed only physical therapy which made my shoulder worse one of the doctors who couldnt figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to dr knapp dr knapp was the only doctor to suggest a mri and he found what was wrong with my shoulder as for dr knapps staff i have never had a bad experience with them brandi or yoli in fact brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful trust me when i say this that if i ever had a bad experience st johns would know and i would post it everywhere i have had bad experiences with other doctors at st johns but not with dr knapp im sorry to hear that some patients have had a bad experience with dr knapp and his staff i truly have had top notch service and have recommended dr knapp to

completely not helpful one of the nurses brandi scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it she had so much attitude that i hobbled out of the office on my crutches i couldnt bear to stay for the consultits hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors exams and appointments i dont need obstinance from hospital staff was this review … useful  funny  cool sheryl b los angeles ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow sheryl b stop following sheryl b  i have nothing but great things to say about dr knapp if you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders hes your guy  i had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who ive trusted for years i was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to dr knapp prior to this appointment id had  cortisone shots physical therapy chiropractic care massage therapy two mris and was still in pain  it turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first mri made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too  when i arrived at dr knapps office i did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other yelp reviews the first doc to see me was a fellow who did a preliminary exam prior to dr knapp entering the room this is a very standard procedure that ive experienced in many other dr offices it was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and dr knapp confirmed it it was a rare genetic abnormality once they figured it out i was given a cortisone shot finally in the right place and after it kicked in i was  cured i write this after more than  months just to make sure the shot wasnt going to wear off and the pain was going to come back i am eternally grateful that i saw dr knapp and his staff vs going under the knife with another doctor was this review … useful  funny  cool  vanessa c manhattan beach ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow vanessa c stop following vanessa c  incision site has not closed up  its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus  his surgery was done the second week in march  we have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages at first dr knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches  when that didnt work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment  my boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail  dr knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up  when my boyfriend tried to get in to see dr knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up  i guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery but after that they will start to charge the patient again  that makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched  dr knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit  i guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery  at this point dr knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him  in the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout get in a pool hot tub steam room or sweat in general because of the risk of infection  the armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection again dr knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person when he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls  when you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office  when you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail  when you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back when you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but dont  after leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from dr knapp  one would think a doctor would call his patients back read this warning before you decide to use this doctor i wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing was this review … useful  funny cool mike w palos verdes estates ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow mike w stop following mike w  ok i have read all of the reviews i am not a woman so i cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery however i can say that dr knapp called me personally several times post surgery including on the weekends and met with me on a saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery i had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery  the comments regarding his assistant brandi are fair i am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte i really didnt appreciate being told to take an advil when clearly i was having a post surgery complicationi am recovered and thankful for my choice of dr knapp as a surgeon for me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home was this review … useful  funny cool marvin w los angeles ca  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow marvin w stop following marvin w  after scheduling my appointment a month in advance i gathered all of the materials i needed including my mri report and a dvd of xrays and showed up on time after a  minute wait i was told that the mri films were needed in addition to the complete report that i provided which was normal films for normal reportsreally sounds like a load of crap to me and then as i was trying to get the films emailed over i was told i needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the necessary records then and there nevermind the fact that another patient showed up an hour late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting call me crazy but dont doctors order reports as needed why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing knapp huh i was told when i booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old and that i would need to repeat them which makes me wonder why i was sent off packing before the doctor could make that assessment himself not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway im surei never had the chance to interact with dr knapp but given how i was treated i will never lay eyes on him if he wants his office to be run by a total insert expletive adjective insert expletive noun then he can be assured hell lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on yelp and elsewhere will grow this office was completely unprofessional and i will make it my lifes mission to ensure that no one i know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice was this review … useful  funny cool self p santa monica ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow self p stop following self p  surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done dont know i understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon what i do know is that i routinely waited over  minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing dr knapp he also has the all time record at any drs office in anytime in my life for making me wait  hour and  minutes past my appointment time to see him if it wasnt for a needed post surgical followup i would have left and seen another dr this office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patients the message that their time is not important but the drs time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important was this review … useful  funny  cool alle a los angeles ca  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow alle a stop following alle a  dr knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer not only does he have incredible bedside manner just ask him why he wanted to get into medicinehe has such a heart for helping others but you wont be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him i do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery these tools are now used worldwide to change the way that surgeons operate i dont know about you but that to me says alota doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately i went to another doctor who had to make  incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that dr knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only  incisions i wont be going to any one else ever again and as for the wait timeid rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isnt as accurate whats more important to youwait time or your body getting the best care i know what my answer is was this review … useful  funny cool melanie p los angeles ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow melanie p stop following melanie p  i really wish i would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with dr knapp  i found his office staff and procedures to be condescending rude and narassistic  they insisted that i have an mri prior to coming in for the appointment that i bring withme the report and the disk  they sent me pages of forms to complete  when i arrived the receptioinst ginger scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment  when i explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that i wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification she told me firmly no  dr knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you  she made several other snappy remarks before i was made to wait to see the drs medical assistant  once i got in to see the medical assistant she told me that i would need to have an xray before i saw the doctor  mind you the doctor had already insisted that i receive an mri test and bring with me the disk and report or he would not see me  so he had my mri why did he need an xray now too that was not mentioned previously and why should i have to be exposed to radiation and have my insurance pay for another procdure prior to my even seeing the doctor  when i asked to speak with dr knapp the mecial assistnat told me sorry he is very particular and will not talk to you without the xray   either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they dont dare risk their job by accomodating a patients reasonable requests or this dr knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients  well im sorry but in santa monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as or more important than dr knapps mine included  so ill be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere was this review … useful  funny cool

fact i have used him twice shoulder and knee surgery  i went to three doctors regarding my shoulder and they all stated i needed only physical therapy which made my shoulder worse one of the doctors who couldnt figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to dr knapp dr knapp was the only doctor to suggest a mri and he found what was wrong with my shoulder as for dr knapps staff i have never had a bad experience with them brandi or yoli in fact brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful trust me when i say this that if i ever had a bad experience st johns would know and i would post it everywhere i have had bad experiences with other doctors at st johns but not with dr knapp im sorry to hear that some patients have had a bad experience with dr knapp and his staff i

doctors i finally found out what the problem was when i saw dr knapp with a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain he is the reason i am basically pain free as with his assistant brandi i had nothing bad to say she called me right back and was very helpful with appointments i have nothing bad to say about knapp he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person do not go to knapp i am a pro fighter and a contractor knapp said my arthritis is so bad that i needed a reverse shoulder replacement he said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cufftendens and ligaments i left his office a complete mess i ended up getting four yes  second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis i told each dr what knapp said after they diagnose me and each one saidi have no idea why he said that i can fix your shoulder you dont need a replacement  knapp is not a good dr i actually think hes making money from the replacement manufactures i am happy to say i am scheduled for surgery a good dr and will be back to the gym in nine months dr knapp is a fantastic dr and a world class surgeon i went in to get my right shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport  years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy ive had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about  years ago with dr knapp as well it too has recovered really well hes a pro do not have your surgery done by dr knapp  years after my shoulder surgery i am still in pain every day he did a really bad job he is also very arrogant huge regrets i didnt go to kerlan jobe like i had with my previous shoulder surgery that one is stronger and better than ever what a mistake he also overcharged me and i literally just now   years later  got a reimbursement check so i felt compelled to write on yelp i could almost forgive the other stuff if i didnt still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly i cant believe this guy has such a great reputation happy first day of breast cancer awareness month to me dr knapp is seemingly illequipped and unprofessional in the administration of care in late  i was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to dr knapp by my primary care physician the first visit was great in front of several associates dr knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer he gave me a cortisone shot referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way i guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because hes done anything but this office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment andor insurance verification hes offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which hes supposed to be the nations foremost authority and communication with him outside of the examination room is only via third party you dont speak with dr knapp ever when you get an appointment prepare to wait and if you need paperwork prepare to fight i read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue i wish i could share in that sentiment but i cant i have not yet had surgery wth dr knapp but i did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members they promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what i needed to bring with me to the appointment when i arrived i was first seen by his fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my mri dr knapp ordered another mri but this time with contrast and much to my surprise he actually called me on saturday morning the day he received my mri results because he said i know patients are anxious to hear their results he answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail since then his staff have promptly followed up with me if my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience i will be a happy camper astonishingly badly run office extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone your appointment with dr knapp is mostly run by another dr with knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end a few months ago i had to wait four weeks for knapp to get back to me re my mri when he did it was some girl named brandi who was going to send me for more tests without telling me what knapp had seen in the mri or what my diagnosis was knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run ive ever experienced to be clear i never actually saw dr knapp i was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff they were unsympathetic and completely not helpful one of the nurses brandi scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it she had so much attitude that i hobbled out of the office on my crutches i couldnt bear to stay for the consult its hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors exams and appointments i dont need obstinance from hospital staff i have nothing but great things to say about dr knapp if you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders hes your guy i had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who ive trusted for years i was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to dr knapp prior to this appointment id had  cortisone shots physical therapy chiropractic care massage therapy two mris and was still in pain it turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first mri made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too when i arrived at dr knapps office i did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other yelp reviews the first doc to see me was a fellow who did a preliminary exam prior to dr knapp entering the room this is a very standard procedure that ive experienced in many other dr offices it was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and dr knapp confirmed it it was a rare genetic abnormality once they figured it out i was given a cortisone shot finally in the right place and after it kicked in i was  cured i write this after more than  months just to make sure the shot wasnt going to wear off and the pain was going to come back i am eternally grateful that i saw dr knapp and his staff vs going under the knife with another doctor incision site has not closed up its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus his surgery was done the second week in march we have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages at first dr knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches when that didnt work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment my boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail dr knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up when my boyfriend tried to get in to see dr knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up i guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery but after that they will start to charge the patient again that makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched dr knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit i guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery at this point dr knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him in the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout get in a pool hot tub steam room or sweat in general because of the risk of infection the armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection again dr knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person when he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls when you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office when you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail when you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back when you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but dont after leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from dr knapp one would think a doctor would call his patients back read this warning before you decide to use this doctor i wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing ok i have read all of the reviews i am not a woman so i cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery however i can say that dr knapp called me personally several times post surgery including on the weekends and met with me on a saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery i had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery the comments regarding his assistant brandi are fair i am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte i really didnt appreciate being told to take an advil when clearly i was having a post surgery complication i am recovered and thankful for my choice of dr knapp as a surgeon for me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home after scheduling my appointment a month in advance i gathered all of the materials i needed including my mri report and a dvd of xrays and showed up on time after a  minute wait i was told that the mri films were needed in addition to the complete report that i provided which was normal films for normal reportsreally sounds like a load of crap to me and then as i was trying to get the films emailed over i was told i needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the necessary records then and there nevermind the fact that another patient showed up an hour late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting call me crazy but dont doctors order reports as needed why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing knapp huh i was told when i booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old and that i would need to repeat them which makes me wonder why i was sent off packing before the doctor could make that assessment himself not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway im sure i never had the chance to interact with dr knapp but given how i was treated i will never lay eyes on him if he wants his office to be run by a total insert expletive adjective insert expletive noun then he can be assured hell lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on yelp and elsewhere will grow this office was completely unprofessional and i will make it my lifes mission to ensure that no one i know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done dont know i understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon what i do know is that i routinely waited over  minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing dr knapp he also has the all time record at any drs office in anytime in my life for making me wait  hour and  minutes past my appointment time to see him if it wasnt for a needed post surgical followup i would have left and seen another dr this office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patients the message that their time is not important but the drs time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important dr knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer not only does he have incredible bedside manner just ask him why he wanted to get into medicinehe has such a heart for helping others but you wont be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him i do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery these tools are now used worldwide to change the way that surgeons operate i dont know about you but that to me says alota doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately i went to another doctor who had to make  incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that dr knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only  incisions i wont be going to any one else ever again and as for the wait timeid rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isnt as accurate whats more important to youwait time or your body getting the best care i know what my answer is i really wish i would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with dr knapp i found his office staff and procedures to be condescending rude and narassistic they insisted that i have an mri prior to coming in for the appointment that i bring withme the report and the disk they sent me pages of forms to complete when i arrived the receptioinst ginger scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment when i explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that i wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification she told me firmly no dr knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you she made several other snappy remarks before i was made to wait to see the drs medical assistant once i got in to see the medical assistant she told me that i would need to have an xray before i saw the doctor mind you the doctor had already insisted that i receive an mri test and bring with me the disk and report or he would not see me so he had my mri why did he need an xray now too that was not mentioned previously and why should i have to be exposed to radiation and have my insurance pay for another procdure prior to my even seeing the doctor when i asked to speak with dr knapp the mecial assistnat told me sorry he is very particular and will not talk to you without the xray either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they dont dare risk their job by accomodating a patients reasonable requests or this dr knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients well im sorry but in santa monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as or more important than dr knapps mine included so ill be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere believe me you are far from the only person who ever has had a problem dealing with brandi its too bad shes such a turnoff because knapp is a great orthopedist i love love love dr knapp he is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners he has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients in fact i have used him twice shoulder and knee surgery i went to three doctors regarding my shoulder and they all stated i needed only physical therapy which made my shoulder worse one of the doctors who couldnt figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to dr knapp dr knapp was the only doctor to suggest a mri and he found what was wrong with my shoulder as for dr knapps staff i have never had a bad experience with them brandi or yoli in fact brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful trust me when i say this that if i ever had a bad experience st johns would know and i would post it everywhere i have had bad experiences with other doctors at st johns but not with dr knapp

latest round of saberrattling between the us and north korean governments us secretary of state rex tillerson laid down the wellworn line “all options” he said during a visit to south korea “are on the table” if he’s serious here’s an option that never seems to get much discussion lately us president donald trump should send tillerson to tell yun byungse his counterpart in seoul that the us is withdrawing its troops from the korean peninsula by a specific date and that after that date the us will cease to guarantee or accept responsibility for the south’s security if the korean war was a person it would be old enough to collect social security benefits it began on june   when the armed forces of the democratic people’s republic of korea “north korea” invaded the republic of korea “south korea” coming up on  years later it continues the two korean regimes still consider themselves at war the us government still keeps nearly  us troops deployed along the ironically named “demilitarized zone” separating the two countries and the situation remains as tense and sporadically violent as ever since  when a temporary ceasefire was signed today south korea is twice as populous and  times as wealthy in terms of gross domestic product as the north boasting the th largest economy in the world north korea ranks th in what universe does it make sense for american taxpayers to continue picking up a substantial portion of the check for south korea’s defense from its smaller poorer less industrially advanced neighbor once upon a time at least briefly this was a republican talking point in  president george w bush announced his intent to withdraw thousands of us troops from south korea over several years he did so in a campaign speech in new mexico — a state he lost in  by fewer votes than libertarian harry browne received during a visit intended to prevent a similar performance by  libertarian candidate michael badnarik for an ever so brief moment bush faked a peacenik end run around both badnarik and democratic candidate john kerry on the subject of north and south korea of course it was back to business as usual and to north korea as allpurpose bogeyman once bush managed to get reelected that november but at least he was willing to broach the subject trump and tillerson should do likewise — and then follow through join the debate on facebook
