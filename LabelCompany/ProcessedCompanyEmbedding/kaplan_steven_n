jul    private equity funds hold assets that are hard to value managers may have an incentive to distort reported valuations if these are used by investors to decide on commitments to subsequent funds managed by the same firm using a large dataset of buyout and venture funds we test for the presence of reported return manipulation we find evidence that some underperforming managers inflate reported returns during times when fundraising takes place however those managers are less likely to raise a next fund suggesting that investors can see through the manipulation on average in contrast we find that topperforming funds likely understate their valuations a simple theoretical framework rationalizes our empirical results as well as those of related papers new are us companies too shortterm oriented some thoughts date posted may    us companies are often criticized for being overly shortterm oriented this paper documents that those criticisms have a long history going back at least thirtyfive years the paper then considers the implications of sustained shorttermism for corporate profits venture capital investments and returns private equity investments and returns and corporate valuations the paper finds little longterm evidence that is consistent with the predictions of the shortterm critics revision financial intermediation in private equity how well do funds of funds perform date posted may    this paper focuses on funds of funds fofs as a form of financial intermediation in private equity both buyout and venture capital after accounting for fees fofs provide returns equal to or above public market indices for both buyout and venture capital while fofs focusing on buyouts outperform public markets they underperform direct fund investment strategies in buyout in contrast the average performance of fofs in venture capital is on a par with results from direct venture fund investing this suggests that fofs in venture capital but not in buyouts are able to identify and access superior performing funds revision how do venture capitalists make decisions date posted feb    we survey  institutional venture capitalists vcs at  firms to learn how they make decisions across eight areas deal sourcing investment decisions valuation deal structure postinvestment valueadded exits internal organization of firms and relationships with limited partners in selecting investments vcs see the management team as more important than business related characteristics such as product or technology they also attribute more of the likelihood of ultimate investment success or failure to the team than to the business while deal sourcing deal selection and postinvestment valueadded all contribute to value creation the vcs rate deal selection as the most important of the three we also explore and find differences in practices across industry stage geography and past success we compare our results to those for cfos graham and harvey  and private equity investors gompers kaplan and mukharlyamov forthcoming revision what do private equity firms say they do date posted sep    we survey  private equity pe investors with combined assets under management of more than  billion about their practices in firm valuation capital structure governance and value creation investors rely primarily on internal rates of return and multiples to evaluate investments their limited partners focus more on absolute performance as opposed to riskadjusted returns capital structure choice is based equally on optimal tradeoff and market timing considerations pe investors anticipate adding value to portfolio companies with a greater focus on increasing growth than on reducing costs we also explore how the actions that pe managers say they take group into specific firm strategies and how those strategies are related to firm founder characteristics revision ceo personality and firm policies date posted jul    based on two samples of high quality personality data for chief executive officers ceos we use linguistic features extracted from conferences calls and statistical learning techniques to develop a measure of ceo personality in terms of the big five traits agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism and openness to experience these personality measures have strong outofsample predictive performance and are stable over time our measures of the big five personality traits are associated with financing choices investment choices and firm operating performance revision are ceos different characteristics of top managers date posted jun    we use a data set of over  executive assessments to study thirty individual characteristics of candidates for top executive positions – ceo cfo coo and others candidate characteristics can be classified by four primary factors general ability execution skills charisma and strategic skills ceo candidates tend to score higher on all four of these factors cfo candidates score lower hired candidates score higher than all assessed candidates on interpersonal skills for each job category suggesting that such skills are important in the selection process scores on the four factors also predict future career progression nonceo candidates who score higher on the four factors are subsequently more likely to become ceos the patterns are qualitatively similar for public private equity and venture capital owned companies we do not find economically large differences in the four factors for men and women women however are ultimately less likely to become ceos holding the  new what do different commercial data sets tell us about private equity performance date posted dec    this paper examines private equity both buyout and venture funds performance around the globe using four data sets from leading commercial sources for north american funds our results echo recent research findings buyout funds have outperformed public equities over long periods of time in contrast venture funds saw performance fall after spectacular results for vintages in the s for funds outside north america buyout funds show performance similar to those in north america while venture fund performance is weaker than in north america venture samples outside north america are however relatively small and strong conclusions await further research the similarity of performance estimates across the data sets strengthens confidence in conclusions about the results of private equity investing revision private equity performance a survey date posted aug    we survey the literature on private equity performance focusing on venture capital and buyout funds rather than portfolio companies we describe recent findings on performance measures average fund returns risk adjustments cyclicality and liquidity persistence interim returns and selfreported net asset values the performance of different types of investors in funds and the links between management contracts and fund returns buyout funds have outperformed the sp  net of fees on average by about  over the life of the fund venture capital funds raised in the s outperformed the sp  while those raised in the s underperformed the results are consistent across a number of datasets and papers before the s buyout and venture capital fund performance showed strong evidence of persistence since  buyout fund persistence has declined while venture capital fund persistence has remained equally strong revision how do private equity investments perform compared to public equity date posted jun    the merits of investing in private versus public equity have generated considerable debate often fueled by concerns about data quality in this paper we use cash flow data derived from the holdings of almost  institutional investors to study over  north american buyout and venture capital funds average buyout fund returns for all vintage years but one before  have exceeded those from public markets averaging about  to  annually post vintage year returns have been roughly equal to those of public markets we find similar performance results for a sample of almost  european buyout funds venture capital performance has varied substantially over time north american venture funds from the s substantially outperformed public equities those from the early s have underperformed and recent vintage years have seen a modest rebound the variation in venture performance is significantly linked to capital flows performance is lower for funds started  new what do private equity firms say they do date

the conventional wisdom for investors in private equity funds is to invest in partnerships that have performed well in the past this is based on the belief that performance in private equity persists across funds of the same partnership we present new evidence on the persistence of us private equity buyout and venture capital funds using a researchquality dataset from burgiss sourced from over  institutional investors relying on detailed cashflow data for funds we study the persistence of buyout and venture capital fund performance of the same general partners across different funds we pay

privacy policy persistence is best predictor of ceo success steven n kaplan  bloomberg facebook twitter email print share world persistence is best predictor of ceo success steven n kaplan by steven n kaplan more stories by steven n kaplan october    pm edt the death of apple inc’s steve jobs has brought a lot of talk about the characteristics of the ideal chief executive officerone school of thought holds that successful ceos are team players good listeners and humble in the book “good to great” jim collins called such people “level ” leadersyet jobs and other superstars such as jeff bezos of amazoncom inc and facebook inc’s mark zuckerberg aren’t generally seen in those terms in a recent article in the wall street journal bezos was described as “not always a ‘nice’ ceo” but rather as one who “can inspire and cajole but also irritate and berate” so which is the right model the humble team player or the arrogant tyrantthe main challenges in answering this question arise because most of the stories and much of the research about ceos are backwardlooking that is to say they identify who has succeeded and then figure out which characteristics those ceos had the potential problem with this methodology is that hundreds of people may have had exactly the same characteristics but only a few succeeded the ones we know about through the stories in other words afterthefact stories don’t always predict what qualities lead to successprior knowledgewhile much has been written about what makes a great corporate chief there is surprisingly little systematic objective work on the topic ideally you would want to look at a group of ceos before they were regarded as successful meaning at the moment they were hired you could classify the different abilities and characteristics they had when they took the job and then see which of those led to better performance in a soontobepublished paper in the journal of finance morten sorensen mark klebanov and i were able to conduct such an experiment we obtained detailed assessments of more than  ceo candidates in firms funded by privateequity investors both buyout and venturecapital firms the assessments were carried out by a company called ghsmart which interviewed each applicant and then rated that person on more than  specific characteristics and abilitieswe classified abilities into three categories some we called “hard” or executionrelated such as being efficient aggressive persistent and proactive some we called “soft” or interpersonal such as being flexible a good listener open to criticism and a team player and some fit neither category such as being persuasive organized analytical and calm a methodological note hard and soft abilities appear to be independent in the sense that they are not correlated with other characteristics such as age or gender we next determined whether the ceo was successful to measure success we used the investors’ evaluations of actual performance and of their investments’ financial returnwhat did we find executionrelated skills were the most important the most successful ceos were those who were persistent efficient and proactive persistent leaders don’t give up they stick with assignments until they are done efficient ceos get a lot done in a short period of time and proactive ones are selfdirected and regularly bring in new ideas differences in persistence efficiency and proactivity were meaningfully related to successfor buyouts ceos who scored high in those dimensions succeeded  percent to  percent of the time ceos who didn’t score well succeeded less than half the time those are big differences some of the “in between” characteristics  particularly being organized  were related to success the softer traits  good listener team player and open to criticism  didn’t matterget things donewhy do we think we got these results and why do we think they are right ceos who are persistent efficient and proactive get things done those who don’t display those skills don’t achieve results even if they are good listeners team players and so on and if a leader doesn’t get things done their employees get frustrated or even leave particularly the better oneswhen people hear these results they usually ask if the patterns apply more broadly for example outside of private equity or for nonceos while we don’t have the data to answer that definitively we suspect the findings would be valid in other fields here are two reasonsfirst in a new book teresa amabile of harvard business school studied what motivates employees and teams within organizations what makes them most enthusiastic about their work she finds that it isn’t money recognition interpersonal support or clear goals instead employees are most positive when they make progress and it is almost redundant to say that persistent efficient proactive ceos make the most progress clear thinking from leading voices in business economics politics foreign affairs culture and more share the view sign up second when i described our study to a senior executive at a leadershiptraining organization he said the results were consistent with what he had seen he wasn’t surprised that we didn’t exactly agree with the findings of “good to great” instead he referred me to a book written more than  years ago by peter drucker one of the great management thinkers of the th century his work was based on personal observation rather than large sample data analysis in the book “the effective executive” drucker wrote “effective executives differ widely in their personalities strengths weaknesses values and beliefs all they have in common is they get the right things done” says effective executives share the following they utilize time efficiently focus on contribution do first things first and make effective rational decisions those qualities are remarkably similar to the ones that mattered in our studylet’s return to the question of what to look for in a ceo level  leaders while humble showed unwavering resolve in other words they were persistent and proactive and there is no doubt that jobs while arrogant and perhaps even unpleasant at times was persistent efficient and proactive both types of ceos can create the kind of progress that motivates employees and succeedssteven n kaplan a professor of entrepreneurship and
