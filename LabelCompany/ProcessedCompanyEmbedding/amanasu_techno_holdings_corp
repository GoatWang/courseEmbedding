biomonitec glaze by nmg inc a japanese corporation traditional microbe level detection systems take at least  hours to process however this mobile system can process the same information in  minutes the company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts the second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine haruka formerly heartlet developed by nanomax corporation in japan the haruka is a machine used in retirement homes hospitals and even in private residences the haruka allows the patient maximum comfort the haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system this machine is the only machine in its class to have a  government rebate which the company believes makes the technology extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis the company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the haruka brand and is now seeking manufacturing partners on april th  the company acquired amanasu water corporation from its sister company amanasu environment corporation and renamed it amanasu support corporation during the quarter ending march   the company sold its  ownership of amanasu support corporation formerly named amanasu water corporation water to its parent company amanasu corporation japan for  because the subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets transferred on the sale the excess was transferred to paidin capital history the company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business see cautionary statements below the company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a highpowered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter the technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with amanasu corporation formerly family corporation amanasu corporation a japanese company and the companys largest shareholder acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors amanasu corporation subsequently transferred the right to the company and the company succeeded to the exclusive worldwide rights atsushi maki a director and officer of the company is the sole shareholder of amanasu corporation at this time the company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies constructing four prototype motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter the market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully to meet the economical sale price requirement the company planned to conduct their manufacturing in china to reduce cost and hoped it would meet the companys expectations however significant difficulty with protecting the companys proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged in addition to proprietary issues there were major concerns in customer service followups ie product warranty maintenance etc the company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in china the result of safety related incidents if not managed appropriately would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the company to solve the two major issues the company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition evader motorsports inc evader an electric motorcycle producer entered into an international distributor agreement whereby the company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of evader products evader in turn would manage customerservice concerns the company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in japan with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties the company also considered evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters the company believed that with a combined effort using both companies resources and technology the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and evaders scooters the research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required first the retail price of the evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the japanese market the research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from china to japan directly the quality of their product is unclear however the retail price of the new companys product effectively competes in the japanese market the refinements needed to make the evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time thus the company has decided to discontinue business relations with evader and abandon the electric scooter project however the company still holds the related patents item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued history continued in place of the electric scooter other projects including a cooperative effort with seems inc formerly introduced as pixen inc and their breakthrough bioscent technology are in development seems inc is a pioneer in the newly developed bioscent technology industry bioscent technology involves the application of scent data transmission a digitized form of scents in various industries such as biotechnology medical care environment security etc in addition to common aroma therapy due to its revolutionary technologies seems has been able to become a multimillion dollar company in less than  years and is expected to become public its daa defensive aromatic air is its current flagship product in addition to being an air purifying system seems daa effectively removes up to  of air pollutants such as ammonia and by products of cigarette smoke it also provides odor neutralization and airborne antibacterial effects seems has also developed a scentparticle sensor which is programmable to detect certain scent particles this sensor is  times more sensitive than even a dogs sense of smell this scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection all diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses seems sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data with uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the fda for various technologies by seems inc the company decided to begin a new project in the foodbeverage industry specifically franchise management under the new leadership of yukinori yoshino who was appointed president of the company as of october th  however due to personal reasons unrelated to the company mr yoshino stepped down as president as of may   with the chairman mr atsushi maki assuming the position of chief executive officer products electric motor scooter the company initial intentions were to participate in the emerging electric vehicle market by using its licensed technologies to design manufacture and market lightweight electric motor scooters the company planned to provide its own battery charging technology to evader motorcycle inc to develop an improved electric scooter aiming at the japan and southeast asian markets however with recently marketing research the evader product was not able to meet the companys pricing standards the companys electric scooter project will be on hold until more customerservice related resources can be attained automated human waste disposal unit haruka this technology collects human waste of hospital and other care facility patients on an individual basis through an automated system patents pending the noninvasive collection mechanism is fastened to patient which in turn is connected to the collector itself the part attached to the patient contains several cleaning mechanisms which are activated automatically through the units controller the collection unit can then be emptied by an attending care professional when the unit is full the company believes that the hospital and related care industries will greatly benefit from this form of technology with an automated system care professional will be able to more effectively allocate their time to more critical patient needs while at the same time the patient is provided with more comfort the company plans to utilize government health care initiatives to reduce the cost the purchaser varies by market which the company believes is the cornerstone to the project that will in turn help revolutionize the care industry the company believes that the haruka is a class i medical device which has a much shorter approval process the company has tentative plans for

name to genesis water technology on august   and to supreme group international inc on december   on june   it changed its name to amanasu technologies corporation it changed its name again on december   to amanasu techno holdings corporationthe company is a development stage company and has not conducted any operations or generated any revenue since its inception the companys principal offices were relocated on april   from  east th street th floor new york ny  to  park avenue center th floor new york ny  telephone   the tokyo branch has relocated from  motoakasaka minatoku tokyo japan to  azabujuubann minatoku tokyo japan telephone  current as of april th  amanasu techno holdings corporation herein after the company acquired amanasu water corporation from its brother company amanasu environment corporation and renamed it to amanasu support corporation the company will continue to manufacture and market  technologies which the company believes have great market potential the first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods called biomonitec glaze by nmg inc a japanese corporation traditional microbe level detection systems take at least  hours to process however this mobile system can process the same information in  minutes the company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts   the second technology is a automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine haruka formerly heartlet developed by nanomax corporation in japan the haruka is a machine used in retirement homes hospitals and even in private residences the haruka allows the patient maximum comfort the haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system this machine is the only machine in its class to have a  government rebate which the company believes makes the technology extremely competative even in the current global economic crisis the company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the haruka brand and is now currently seeking manufacturing partners          history the company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business see cautionary statements below the company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a highpowered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter the technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with amanasu corporation formerly family corporation amanasu corporation a japanese company and the companys largest shareholder acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors amanasu corporation subsequently transferred the right to amanasu technologies corporation and the company succeeded to the exclusive worldwide rights atsushi maki a director of the company is the sole shareholder of amanasu corporation at this time the company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies constructing four prototype motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter the market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully to meet the economical sale price requirement the company planned to conduct their manufacturing in china to reduce cost and hoped it would meet the companys expectations however significant difficulty with protecting the companys proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged in addition to proprietary issues there were major concerns in customer service followups ie product warranty maintenance etc the company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in china the result of safety related incidents if not managed appropriately would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the company to solve the two major issues the company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition evader motersports inc evader an electric motorcycle producer entered into an international distributor agreement whereby the company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of evader products evader in turn would manage customerservice concerns the company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in japan with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties the company also considered evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters the company believed that with a combined effort using both companies resources and technology the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and evaders scooters the research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required first the retail price of the evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the japanese market the research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from china to japan directly the quality of their product is unclear however the retail price of the new companys product effectively competes in the japanese market the refinements needed to make the evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time thus the company has decided to discontinue business relations with evader and abandon the electric scooter project however the company still holds the related patents in place of the electric scooter other projects including a cooperative effort with seems inc formerly introduced as pixeninc and their breakthrough bioscent technology are in development seems inc is a pioneer in the newly developed bioscent technology industry bioscent technology involves the application of scent data transmission a digitized form of scents in various industries such as biotechnology medical care environment security etc in addition to common aroma therapy due to its revolutionary technologies seems has been able to become a multimillion dollar company in less than  years and is expected to become public by early  its daa defensive aromatic air is its current flagship product in addition to being an air purifying system seems daa effectively removes up to  of air pollutants such as ammonia and by products of cigarette smoke it also provides odor neutralization  and airborne antibacterial effects seems has also developed a scentparticle sensor which is programmable to detect certain scent particles this sensor is  times more sensitive than even a dogs sense of smell this scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection all diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses seemss sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data with uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the fda for various technologies by seems inc the company decided to begin a new project in the foodbeverage industry specifically franchise management under the new leadership of yukinori yoshino who was appointed president of the company as of october th  however due to personal reasons unrelated to the company mr yoshino stepped down as president as of may   with the chairman mr atsushi maki assuming the position of chief executive officer          products electric motor scooter the company initial intentions were to participate in the emerging electric vehicle market by using its licensed technologies to design manufacture and market lightweight electric motor scooters the company planned to provide its own battery charging technology to evader motorcycle inc to develop an improved electric scooter aiming at the japan and southeast asian markets however with recently marketing research the evader product was not able to meet the companys pricing standards the companys electric scooter project will be on hold until more customerservice related resources can be attained automated human waste disposal unit “haruka” this technology collects human waste of hospital and other care facility patients on an individual basis through an automated system patents pending the noninvasive collection mechanism is fastened to patient which in turn is connected to the collector itself the part attached to the patient contains several cleaning mechanisms which are activated automatically through the units controller the collection unit can then be emptied by an attending care professional when the unit is full the company believes that the hospital and related care industries will greatly benefit from this form of technology with an automated system care professional will be able to more effectively allocate their time to more critical patient needs while at the same time the patient is provided with more comfort the company plans to utilize government health care initiatives to reduce the cost the purchaser varies by market which the company believes is the cornerstone to the project that will in turn help revolutionize the care industry the company believes that the haruka is a class i medical device which has a much shorter approval process the company has tentative plans for production during  however cannot guarantee this schedule plan of operation the company is a development stage corporation it has not commenced its planned operations of manufacturing and marketing a lightweight electrical motor scooter its operations to date have been limited to conducting various tests on its technologies the company will continue to develop and market two technologies which the company believes have great market potential the first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods called biomonitec glaze by nmg inc a japanese corporation traditional microbe level detection systems take at least  hours to process however this mobile system can process the same information in  minutes the company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial

this machine is the only machine in its class to have a  government rebate which the company believes makes the technology extremely competative even in the current global economic crisis the company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the haruka brand and is now currently seeking manufacturing partners        the company will also be concentrating its efforts on capital raising efforts to enter into the nasdaq global market the company satisfies all entry requirements except for investment capital the companys target is to raise  in the near future as stated above the company can not predict whether or not it will be successful in its capital raising efforts and thus be able to satisfy its cash requirements for the next  months if the company is unsuccessful in raising at least  it may not be able to complete its plan of operations as discussed above the company is expecting to gain the capital from issuing and selling the shares of the company during the quarter ending march   the company sold its  ownership of amanasu support corporation formerly named amanasu water corporation water to the parent company amanasu corporation japan for  because the subsidiary had an

liabilities as at march   was  compared to  at december   expenses for the three months ended march   were  compared to  for the same period of the prior year the increase is primarily due to higher professional and filing fees the net loss for the three months ended march   was  compared with  for the same period of the prior year the higher loss is due to increases in administrative expense and interest expense          liquidity and capital resources the companys cash requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be  this amount is comprised of the following estimate expenditures  in annual salaries for office personnel office expenses and travel  for rent  for professional fees and for miscellaneous expenses the company has sufficient cash on hand to support its overhead for the next twelve months and there are no material commitments for capital at this time other than as described above the company will need to issue and sell shares to gain capital for operations
