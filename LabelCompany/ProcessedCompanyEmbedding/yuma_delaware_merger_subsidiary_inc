transaction upon completion of the transaction which is subject to the approval of stockholders of both companies davis will become a wholly owned subsidiary of yuma we believe the combination of these two companies is a compelling value transaction for each companys owners and look forward to working with davis and its board of directors to complete the merger said sam l banks chairman and chief executive officer of yuma this transaction truly represents a scenario where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and is anticipated to increase our proved reserves by approximately

rates once the transaction is complete yuma expects significant ga synergies associated with the merger and will be well positioned to take advantage of the collective portfolios of the combined

which will have a liquidation preference of approximately  million and is estimated to have a conversion price of approximately  per share after giving effect for the reverse split upon closing there is expected to be an aggregate of approximately  million shares of common stock outstanding with approximately  being owned by the current common stockholders of davis the transaction is expected to qualify as a taxdeferred reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of  davis is a houstonbased oil and gas company over  of the common stock of davis is owned by entities controlled by or coinvesting with evercore capital partners red mountain capital partners and sankaty advisors on june   and effective as of may   we entered into the waiver and tenth amendment the amendment to our credit agreement the credit agreement with société générale the bank as administrative agent and issuing bank and each of the lenders and guarantors party thereto the amendment maintains our borrowing base at  million and automatically reduces our borrowing base to  million on the earliest of i august   if the registration statement on form s the form s filed with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to the pending merger agreement has not been declared effective by such date ii the date that is fortyseven days after the date the form s has been declared effective by the sec iii september   and iv in the event of the termination of the merger agreement in the event that the sec does not declare the form s effective by august   we expect to enter into discussions with our lenders participating in our credit facility and enter into a new amendment to the credit facility that will extend the waiver of these breaches until the closing of the merger the credit agreement is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets a breach of any of the terms and conditions or the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement could result in acceleration of our indebtedness in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable as a result we have classified the outstanding balance under our credit facility as current receipt of audit opinion with going concern qualification the audit opinion provided by the companys independent public auditing firm relating to the companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included a going concern qualification the companys audited consolidated financial statements were included in its annual report on form ka for the year ended december   which was filed with the sec on may   generally due to net losses incurred and borrowing base deficiencies under the credit agreement as discussed above the companys independent registered public accounting firm indicated in its opinion that these conditions raise a substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern as discussed above on february   the company entered into the merger agreement for an allstock transaction upon completion of the transaction which is subject to shareholder and bank approval as well as other customary conditions and approvals and in the absence of significant reduction in commodity prices the company believes it will be able to satisfy its lenders and eliminate any borrowing base deficiency further the company believes that its auditors may withdraw the going concern qualification while management believes that the merger is likely to occur it can provide no assurance of the completion of the merger with davis or any elimination of its borrowing base deficiency or any amendment to the credit agreement further the company can provide no assurance that its auditors will withdraw their going concern qualification please refer to our annual report on form ka for the year ended december   our form q for the quarterly periods ended march
