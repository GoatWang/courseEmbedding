of the master funds business its results of operations depend on the general partners ability to recognize and capitalize on trends and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the global capital and commodity markets the general partners investment and trading methods are confidential so that substantially the only information that can be furnished regarding the master funds results of operations is contained in the performance record of its trading unlike operating businesses general economic or seasonal conditions do not directly affect the profit potential of the master fund and its past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results the general partner believes however that there are certain market conditions for example markets with strong price trends in which the master fund has a better likelihood of being profitable than in others liquidity and capital resources units may be offered for sale as of the beginning and may be redeemed as of the end of each month the amount of capital raised for the partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations as the partnership and the master fund have no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses brokerage commissions and charges within broad ranges of capitalization the general partners trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the master fund in which the partnership participates the partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of units and capital is increased through trading profits if any neither the partnership nor the master fund engages in borrowing the master fund trades futures and forward contracts and may trade swap spot and options contracts on interest rates commodities currencies metals energy and stock indices risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts market risk and the potential inability of counterparties or brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts credit risk market risk is generally to be measured by the face amount of the futures positions acquired and the volatility of the markets traded the credit risk from counterparty nonperformance associated with these instruments is the net unrealized gain if any on these positions plus the value of the margin or collateral held by the counterparty the risks associated with exchangetraded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with otc transactions because exchanges typically but not universally provide clearinghouse arrangements in which the collective credit in some cases limited in amount in some cases not of the members of the exchange is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange in most otc transactions on the other hand traders must rely typically but not universally solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties margins which may be subject to loss in the event of a default are generally required in exchange trading and counterparties may require margin or collateral in the otc markets  the general partner has procedures in place to control market risk although there can be no assurance that they will in fact succeed in doing so these procedures primarily focus on  real time monitoring of open positions  diversifying positions among various markets  limiting the assets committed as margin or collateral generally within a range of  to  of an accounts net assets at exchange though the amount may at any time be substantially higher and  prohibiting pyramiding that is using unrealized profits in a particular market as margin for additional positions in the same market the general partner attempts to control credit risk by causing the partnership to deal exclusively with large wellcapitalized financial institutions as brokers and counterparties the financial instruments traded by the master fund contain varying degrees of offbalance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures forward and spot contracts or the master funds satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the statements of financial condition of the master fund due to the nature of the master funds business substantially all its assets are represented by cash cash equivalents and us government obligations while the master fund maintains its market exposure through open futures forward and spot contract positions the master funds futures contracts are settled by offset and are cleared by the exchange clearinghouse function open futures positions are markedtomarket each trading day and the master funds trading accounts are debited or credited accordingly options on futures contracts are settled either by offset or by exercise if an option on a future is exercised the master fund is assigned a position in the underlying future which is then settled by offset the master funds spot and forward currency transactions conducted in the interbank market are settled by netting offsetting positions or payment obligations and by cash payments the value of the master funds cash and financial instruments is not materially affected by inflation changes in interest rates which are often associated with inflation could cause the value of certain of the master funds debt securities to decline but only to a limited extent more importantly changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down market price trends during which the master funds profit potential generally increases however inflation can also give rise to markets which have numerous short price trends followed by rapid reversals markets in which the master fund is likely to suffer losses the master funds assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents including us government securities or securities issued by federal agencies other commodity futures trading commissionauthorized investments or bank held or certain other money market instruments eg bankers acceptances and eurodollar or other time deposits which are used to margin the master funds futures forward and spot currency positions and withdrawn as necessary to pay redemptions and expenses other than potential marketimposed limitations on liquidity due for example to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits which are inherent in the master funds futures forward and spot trading the master funds assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so during its operations through march   the partnership through its investment in the master fund experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the numerous markets traded by the general partner critical accounting estimates the master fund records its transactions in futures forward and spot contracts including related income and expenses on a trade date basis open futures contracts traded on an exchange are valued at fair value which is based on the closing settlement price on the exchange where the futures contract is traded by the master fund on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined spot currency contracts are valued based on current market prices spot price forward currency contracts are valued based on pricing models that consider the spot price plus the financing cost or benefit forward point forward points from the quotation service providers are generally in periods of one month two months three months six months nine months and twelve months forward while the contractual forward delivery dates for the forward currency contracts traded by the master fund may be in between these periods the general partners policy to determine fair value for forward currency contracts involves first calculating the number of months from the date the forward currency contract is being valued to its maturity date months to maturity then identifying the forward currency contracts for the two forward months that are closest to the months to maturity forward month contracts linear interpolation is then performed between the dates of these two forward month contracts to calculate the interpolated forward point model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment such instruments are typically classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions such as accrual of expenses that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements based on the nature of the business and operations of the partnership the general partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the partnerships financial statements are appropriate and reasonable however actual results could differ from these estimates the estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment the general partner further believes that based on the nature of the business and operations of the partnership no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the partnerships critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported  results of operations due to the nature of the partnerships trading through its investment in the master fund the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year period ended march   total partners capital of the month ending partnership march     december    three months change in partners capital   percent change   three

ended march   during a quarter of extreme market volatility the fund registered a strong performance led by gains on long interest rate futures positions trading of equity futures and foreign exchange forwards were also profitable meanwhile commodity futures were marginally negative as a gain from trading energy futures was outweighed by fractional losses from trading metal and agricultural futures concerns about global growth that international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde described as …too low too fragile and facing increased risks to its durability… combined with doubts about policy makers competence and capabilities generated strong demand for government securities for most of the quarter the demand for this debt was underpinned when the bank of japan moved official interest rates into negative territory at the end of january the bank of england delayed any potential rate increase the european central bank the ecb and peoples bank of china the pboc eased monetary policy in march and a speech by federal reserve fed chair janet yellen squashed expectations for a near term fed rate increase consequently long positions in us german french italian british japanese australian and canadian notes and bonds were profitable long positions in shortterm dollar and sterling interest rate futures were also profitable equity markets were particularly volatile during the first quarter of  tracing out a classic vshaped path the tumultuous first half of the period saw many equity indices experiencing multiyear lows before rebounding impressively over the second half of the quarter early on weak economic data out of china and concerns about official policy decisions generated a renewed rout in chinese equities and the yuan these events combined with a further collapse in energy prices worries that fed interest rate increases and a stronger dollar might impede global growth and a halt in corporate profit growth produced a broad sharp equity selloff later equity prices recovered as energy prices rebounded the ecb pboc and fed displayed easier policy tendencies the us dollar eased and growth concerns moderated on balance short positions in chinese hong kong japanese singaporean indian and spanish futures were profitable trading of us and canadian stock index futures also posted gains on the other hand short positions in dutch and south african futures a long uk stock futures position and trading of the european stoxx future resulted in somewhat offsetting losses foreign exchange trading was also volatile at the beginning of the year given the search for safety declining oil prices and the fed relatively hawkish policy position the us dollar strengthened thus during january and february long dollar trades versus the pound sterling canadian dollar korean won russian ruble and mexican peso were profitable the pound fell precipitously when the possibility of britains exit from the eu became more likely and boris johnson the mayor of london endorsed the move as the quarter unfolded however the pboc aggressively implemented measures to support the yuan the g shanghai communique in late february signaled a strong stance against currency competition that took some steam out of the dollar and the likelihood of a near term increase in interest rates by the fed diminished prompting a us dollar decline especially against emerging market currencies where interest rates tend to be higher a stabilization of commodity prices also helped the commodity producing countries a series of events abroad further encouraged the us dollar slippage mexicos surprise february  basis point hike in official interest rates the increasing likelihood of an ouster of president dilma rousseff in brazil an increase in official rates in south africa and rising oil prices and high interest rates supporting the russian ruble consequently short dollar positions against the currencies of australia brazil canada columbia india israel mexico new
