identities in his scientific life  among them philosopher poet neurologist neurophysiologist neuropsychiatrist collaborator theorist cybernetician mentor engineer he was writes tara abraham in this account of mccullochs life and work an intellectual showman and performed this part throughout his career while mcculloch claimed a common thread in his work was the problem of mind and its relationship to the brain there was much more to him than that in rebel genius abraham uses mccullochs life as a window on a past scientific age showing the complex transformations that took place in american brain and mind science in the twentieth century  particularly those surrounding the cybernetics movementabraham describes mccullochs early work in neuropsychiatry and his emerging identity as a neurophysiologist she explores his transformative years at the illinois neuropsychiatric institute and his work with walter pitts  often seen as the first iteration of artificial intelligence but here described as stemming from the new tradition of mathematical treatments of biological problems abraham argues that mccullochs dual identities as neuropsychiatrist and cybernetician are inseparable he used the authority he gained in traditional disciplinary roles as a basis for posing big questions about the brain and mind as a cybernetician when mcculloch moved to the research laboratory of electronics at mit new practices for studying the brain grounded in mathematics philosophy and theoretical modeling expanded the relevance and ramifications of his work mccullochs transdisciplinary legacies anticipated todays multidisciplinary field of cognitive sciencescience  technology cyberneticscondition used  goodhpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new unused and
