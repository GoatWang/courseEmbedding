supply chain risks as oems but they can often identify potential risks faster than their oem customers by james carbone  many electronics oems spend considerable time and devote considerable resources identifying and eliminating risks in their supply chains often they rely on their electronics manufacturer services ems providers to help them reduce risk because ems providers are in a unique position in the supply chain they often have dozens of oem customers and thousands of suppliers with such a view into the supply chain ems providers can see potential supply disruptions developing before their oem customers do erich hoch chief supply officer for ems provider jabil circuit based in st petersburg fla says many ems providers face the same risks as oems those risks include continuity of supply driven by geopolitical events sourcing option constraints leadtimes quality issues compliance to environmental and other regulations and suppliers’ financial instability an ems provider’s risk isnt greater than an oem but it is more complex given the nature of the business as an aggregator in the supply chain says hoch an ems provider combines similar component requirements of oem customers in different industries and buys a wide variety of parts using a large number of suppliers in diverse geographies he explains “the benefits of this aggregation are deeper supply chain knowledge and greater visibility” says hoch “at the end of the day we should be better than oems at risk mitigation” “at the end of the day we should be better than oems at risk mitigation” says eric hoch chief supply officer for jabil circuithe notes that jabil has dedicated focused resources that monitor manage and mitigate risk the company has developed supply chain software tools that enable it to not only react quickly to disruptions in the supply chain but also to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks to identify risks jabil looks at the different attributes of the supply chain” including the origin of parts sourcing options such as whether a part is single or multisourced the status of the supplier whether the supplier is strategic to jabil and part change and leadtime risks “through our tools we have a systemic proactive methodology to identify classify and prioritize risk” says hoch everyone’s business at ems provider sanmina headquartered in san jose calif “everyone helps manage risk to some extent” says troy hiner vice president of supply management “we have our own extensive market updates which we build and share with all sanmina teams but to help identify risks we also pull in data from the supply base from all regions of the world industry market resources the news media our front line procurement teams our sales teams and our customers” he says every risk is unique and can affect a different piece of sanmina’s business according to hiner “some risks pop up quickly like issues created by natural disasters or transportation strikes while some concerns are always in the background like the problems the industry is seeing with north korea right now” he says regardless of the type of risk longterm strategic planning coupled with “the ability to quickly address an unforeseen issue” is imperative to mitigate risk says hiner strategic planning includes having multiple sources and parts and regional diversity” of supply he adds hiner notes that contingency plans are crucial in helping to reduce risk and guarantee continuity of supply “to identify risks we pull in data from the supply base from all regions of the world industry market resources the news media our front line procurement teams our sales teams and our customers” says troy hiner vice president of supply management at sanmina“however you just can’t plan for everything that could possibly happen” he says for instance an ems provider may have multiple sources for a semiconductor however if the facility of a resin supplier that provides material for the semiconductor package gets damaged by a flood manufacturing of the package material can shut down and disrupt production of the chip “that’s why you need longterm contingency planning established supply partners and a team that communicates well and works together closely to come up with a solution to attack an issue the very instant it occurs” ems providers say certain commodities have more risk than others depending on their manufacturing processes and the amount of customization required often custom parts have single sources “i am very concerned with single source strategy and therefore those components have a much higher visibility in our company” in terms of risk says hoch besides having multiple suppliers for a part jabil also diversifies its sourcing locations the ems provider tries to make sure crucial components are built in different geographies so if a disaster strikes one location the part is available from a facility in a different region jabil also maintains “intelligent safety stock levels and continually sweeps bill of material bom data for multiple preselected attributes and then identifies and prioritizes types of risk as well as potential revenue impact to customers and ourselves” says hoch “our experts develop an action plan and work it proactively” disclaimer the opinions beliefs and viewpoints expressed by the various authors andor forum

acquisition underlines digital transformation  disruption in retail bioemail thisprintcomment  erich hoch  ceo jabil packaging solutions   post a comment no ratingslogin to rate tweet we are all aware of the disruption occurring in the retail space and the digital transformation the sector is currently undergoing underlined by amazon’s acquisition of whole foods and bringing its supply chain ecommerce and big data expertise to bear in fact big data played a role in the selection of the acquisition target amazon was able to identify the retailer with the largest overlap with their amazon prime customer base  at jabil packaging solutions we recently commissioned dimensional research to conduct a survey entitled ‘trends in ecommerce packaging’ and the results serve to underline the importance packaging plays in the brand and retail experience packaging’s increasingly important role in retail is not just because it helps a product’s shelf appeal but often because it is the first physical and tactile experience a consumer has with an online brand everyone loves unwrapping gifts on a special occasion which brand wouldn’t want to deliver that joy every time a consumer receives its product  in the survey almost all  agreed that packaging impacts the purchase experience citing the condition of the package on arrival lack of waste and ease of opening as the key factors most over  agreed that bad packaging can ruin a customer experience whilst good packaging creates a memorable customer experience enhancing the brand in the eyes of the consumer it seems certain that competition in this area will only increase particularly as amazon leverages alexa and the smart algorithms that influence purchasing decisions and drive product adoption brands are going to have to respond quickly to this disruption with innovative solutions of their own smart packaging that delivers information like spoilage replenishment or expiry dates to the consumer as well as data on usage to the brand is a great place to start huge numbers of consumers enjoy the frictionless convenience of shopping with amazon with its simple purchasing and delivery process but many businesses underestimate the role of packaging in this experience our survey participants drawn from both the online and physical retail space were divided on where the role of packaging was most important but most  agreed that it was a brand’s responsibility to deliver good packaging to all channels amazon is an innovator and bringing this innovation to grocery shopping is a likely disruptor for the entire sector so what do online and instore retailers need to consider to stay uptodate with technology in packaging smart packaging plays an increasingly important role in retail the ability to highlight the need to replenish and connect that need with a simple route to reorder offers great potential for brand loyalty as well as real time data that can influence marketing and of course improve the supply chain rfid is also playing a greater role as tag costs reduce which in turn drives adoption packaging that can selfreport problems in the shipment process is possible and smart tags or labels can also help drive new models for autoreplenishment imagine being at the store and being able to check remaining volumes or getting a lowlevel warning on your smartphone or perhaps being able to review the use by dates of your refrigerator’s contents in the survey  said that they see opportunities for packaging innovation with modern technology  what’s more as packaging plays a greater role we need to be more cognoscente of the need for a sustainable approach packaging needs to be simple and have as little environmental impact as possible this might mean selecting different materials all while driving costs down and ensuring the product reaches the consumer in good condition and delivers a good brand experience this will become even more important as the convenience of seamless home delivery encourages consumers to buy smaller quantities more often  while we all try to assess the result of such a disruption in the retail space we can be sure of one thing this will not be the last change we see brands are going to need to be more agile adapting to change as it occurs leveraging partners to drive more value and more innovation of their own bringing new solutions to the market faster than ever before the world has moved to one of instant gratification and every brand will need to improve their speed to market in response we believe that good packaging drives brand brilliance and can be the difference between alsoran packaging and brand leadership  we also believe that packaging will be a key battleground for retail brands as they seek to win the mindshare of an increasingly techsavvy consumer email thisprintcomment comments view comments newest first  oldest first  threaded close this box be the first to post a comment regarding this story ebn newswire
