his examination of postwar growth politics the book contrasts the reasons for expansion and the way it has occurred in the past fifty years with the negative effects it has produced and the reactions against it he also looks at the attitudes and behaviors that have developed as americans have become a people of more more the politics of economic growth in postwar america robert m collins description james carville famously reminded bill clinton throughout  that its the economy stupid yet for the last forty years historians of modern america have ignored the economy to focus on cultural social and political themes from the birth of modern feminism to the fall of the berlin wall now a scholar has stepped forward to place the economy back in its rightful place at the center of his historical narrative in more robert m collins reexamines the history of the united states from franklin delano roosevelt to bill clinton focusing on the federal governments determined pursuit of economic growth after tracing the emergence of growth as a priority during fdrs presidency collins explores the record of successive administrations highlighting both their success in fostering growth and its partisan uses collins reveals that the obsession with growth appears not only as a matter of policy but as an expression of cold war ideologyboth a means to pay for the arms buildup and proof of the superiority of the united states market economy but under johnson this enthusiasm sparked a crisis spending on vietnam unleashed runaway inflation while the nation struggled with the moral consequences of its prosperity reflected in books such as john kenneth galbraiths the affluent society and rachel carsons silent spring more continues up to the end of the s as collins explains the real impact of reagans policies and astutely assesses clintons disciplined growthmanship which combined deficit reduction and a relaxed but watchful monetary policy by the federal reserve writing with eloquence and analytical clarity robert m collins offers a startlingly new framework for understanding the history of postwar america show more more the politics of economic growth in postwar america

account of postworld war ii americas love affair with the blessings of economic growth in the process we learn much about federal efforts sometimes successful sometimes not to sustain it i learned a great deal about policymaking and economic ideas from collins thoroughly researched analysisjames t patterson author of grand expectationsthe united states  more is one of those rare books that will actually change how historians perceive the past through the prism of government attitudes toward abundance robert collins finds fresh things to say about american presidents from franklin d roosevelt to bill clinton challenges current perceptions of richard nixon and ronald reagan and raises searching questions about how we should evaluate economic policy todaywilliam e leuchtenburg university of north carolina at chapel hill in more robert collins provides a thoroughly historicized account of how american attitudes toward economic growth have evolved in the latter half of the twentieth century this project altogether unusual and sorely needed prompts us to examine critically a vast array of deeplyheld beliefs concerning the virtues and costs of economic expansion in a fashion that is as welcome as it is necessary moreover it allows collins to provide us with a novel and most thoughtprovoking consideration of the social and political forces that paved the way for the supplyside revolution of the reagan years a fine achievement and a most important contributionmichael a bernstein university of california san diego more is a brilliant and fascinating examination of the postwar politics of growth from its liberal heyday between the late s and the late s through its trials in the s and into its antistatist reincarnation in the s and beyond growthmanship in robert collins engaging account is at once an economic panacea a political compromise and a cultural consensusa tangle of aspirations and anxieties that confounded policymakers both when it paid off and when it did not this is economic history at its best offering both a subtle and accessible account of growth politics and its dilemmas and a compelling argument for their importance in framing our broader understanding of the postwar eracolin gordon university of iowa more is essential reading for anyone interested in american growth policy since the new deal thoroughly researched lucidly written and fully cognizant of the subjects complexities and ambiguities it offers not only a fascinating and much needed reconstruction of american growth initiatives and their critics but also a new and persuasive conceptualization of successive growth regimes and divergent political visions and prescriptions in major respects it adds to or alters our understanding of new deal ambivalence postnew
