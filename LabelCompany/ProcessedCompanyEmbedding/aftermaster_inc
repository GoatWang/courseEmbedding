possibilities in digital audio processing   aftermaster audio labs is headed by a group of world class audio engineers and music industry veterans who have been involved with the development and implementation of countless successful proprietary audio technologies and products over the last  years as well as an unrivaled resume of hit music recordings the aftermaster audio labs mission was to bring texture shape form and emotion back to consumer audio  the rapid adoption of digital audio was a disruptive and highly transformative force in not only the music industry but also the consumer electronics industry however few addressed the issue of whether digital audio quality could really be markedly improved   aftermaster audio labs undertook the challenge of finding innovative ways to take digital audio to significantly greater heights in amplitude depth and clarity without altering file size or distorting the original recording solving the digital audio riddle involved exploring unconventional approaches and pairing technological innovation with the team’s expertise to develop a novel technology that can solve a variety of issues that were limiting the sound quality of digital audio after thousands of hours of developing listening and testing a true breakthrough in digital audio processing emerged that far surpassed expectations and has the potential to change the industry once again  that technology is the award winning aftermaster audio “aftermaster” aftermaster labs maintains five primary business units professional music mastering consumer electronics online mastering aftermaster recording and mastering studios and audio consulting services aftermaster audio technology aftermaster is a groundbreaking and revolutionary audio technology developed for mastering remastering and processing of audio  it is unlike any other audio enhancement product or mastering process commercially available  aftermaster delivers an unparalleled clarity depth imaging and fullness to audio recordings while delivering a significant increase in volume without increased distortion loss of dynamic range or affecting high and low frequencies  it brings audio alive and creates imaging and depth to the flat sound field inherent in digital audio  its versatility and smart processing characteristics make it effective across a broad range of applications stemming from professional recording studios to a standalone speaker unit the aftermaster process is highly sophisticated and was developed by challenging the listening standard for digital audio that became the

engineers to master music for some of the worlds biggest artists for online music mastering for independent artists and soon in consumer hardware products the aftermaster difference audio enhancement technologies have been offered for decades and generally focus on using wideners expander’s and volume boosters  traditional enhancers typically add high end exciters and widen the audio to make sound appear to be enhanced when in reality they lose frequency range change the balance and degrade the sonic integrity noticeably  this results in a muddy playback or changes important elements of a recording  in music it thins out the drums vocals bass losing the top or bottom and the dynamic range  in essence the production style and creative intent of what the artist engineers producers and mastering technicians intended for the public to hear is changed by blanket processors unlike other audio post production processes aftermaster preserves the original intention of an audio event and brings greater clarity depth and amplitude to all of the audio elements without changing the integrity of the underlying recording this is accomplished by aftermaster’s proprietary and stateoftheart adaptive intuitive response™ mechanisms and complex algorithms which provide a ground breaking pristine listening experience where virtually every sonic detail is heard with added warmth and fidelity  indeed without any compromises apparent volume richness and clarity can now be obtained on any device when aftermaster’s real time intuitive audio enhancement is utilized for more information on
