weighted in our opinion there are many types of smart beta approaches and the ones we believe are attracting the most attention currently are   equally weighted indexes components are often selected from established indexes such as the sp  but are equally weighted so that all components have identical weights when rebalanced fundamentally weighted indexes components are selected to provide broad exposure to an equity market based on market capitalization but companies are weighted by a fundamental factor such as aggregate dividends or earnings factorbased indexes components are selected based on one or more fundamental factors and are weighted based on one or more fundamental factors factorbased indexes can also be modified equal weighted where stocks are first divided into tiers based on certain factors and then equal weighted within those tiers low volatility indexes components are selected because they have exhibited lower volatility than the overall stock market andor are weighted based on their historic volatility the history of smart beta   though you may just now be hearing about smart beta etfs they have been around for some time in fact wisdomtree was an early pioneer in this category inventing the concept of dividend weighting equity markets  in  we launched one of the first families of alternatively weighted etfs calling them “fundamentally weighted”we weighted these first etfs by dividends because we believe there is a benefit to rebalancing equity markets back to a measure of relative value  from there in  we applied the same methodology to the earningsgenerating segments of the market to expand our offering  today wisdomtree offers investors smart beta etfs in all major equity markets around the world dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time the benefits of smart beta  investment managers and investors alike are always looking for better ways to invest indexing can be highly efficient and etfs have a number of benefits that make them a wise way to invest and have led to their quick adoption and impressive industry growth enhanced portfolio returns increased dividend income reduced portfolio risk more efficient exposure to equity risk premium equity risk premium refers to the excess return that an individual stock or the overall stock market provides over a riskfree rate this excess return compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of the equity market the size of the premium will vary as the risk in a particular stock or in the stock market as a whole changes highrisk investments are compensated with a higher premium past performance is not indicative of future results diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time the future of smart beta etfs   while some industry insiders may worry that smart beta is a fad investors do not seem to agree consider that  uslisted etfs tracking nonmarket capweighted indexes gathered  billion or nearly onethird of new net inflows in   a new study conducted by cogent research a division of market strategies international indicates that more than half  of institutional decision makers will increase their use of smart beta etfs over the next three years—that’s more than any other etf category including market capweighted etfs   according to morningstar etfs have grown at double the rate of mutual funds since january  with asset growth of  and  respectively we believe these findings could lead to smart beta being the largest category of etfs and the primary driver of etf growth going forward perhaps helping them match equity mutual fund assets under management currently  trillion in less than a decade
