the ariston rd in  with castle precision engineering ltd machining many of the parts robertson left ariston which had been taken over by dunlop westayr ltd and reorganised as ariston audio ltd in february  linn products ltd was formed to sell turntables made by castle precision engineering this was officially announced in an advertisement in hifi news  record review with the following text the turntable previously available under the name ariston rd is now available under the name linn lp there were claims and even patent litigation at the time that the first linn sondek lp was a carbon copy of the rd and many parts interchangeable ultimately the patent was awarded successfully to linn the companys philosophy is as controversial as its founder who is known for his believing in only two ways of doing things – the linn way and the wrong way whilst many in the industry speak of them in strictly reverential terms notable critic ken kessler accuses the company with a touch of hyperbole of being doctrinaire prone to propaganda brainwashing historical revisionism and other ways of interpreting reality as such and because linn supposedly design their products within the

however the lps sound quality has been improved through retrofittable upgrade kits the successive upgrades consist mostly of refinements in materials used and improved manufacturing tolerances in  some thirty years after the birth of the compact disc sales of the lp and accessories still accounted for  percent of the companys turnover in  linn patented its isobaric loading principle and launched the linn isobarik loudspeaker initially linn manufactured the lp itself but not any other components such as tonearms and cartridges this gap was filled with a largely complementary range

itself the sondek cd pioneered by alan clark was launched in  in  it was discontinued when philips ended production of the laser around which the player was designed on  november  linn said it would stop making cd players to focus on digital streaming products instead  crisisedit in may  linn announced that founder ivor tiefenbrun would relinquish the position of linns managing director in favour of fd and company secretary peter murphy an year veteran of the firm as part of his succession planning tiefenbrun had appointed him to the linn board in november  as the obvious successor in the short term along with his elder son natan at around that time tiefenbrun executed a share swap with his brother marcus in exchange for his shares in castle precision engineering consolidating his stake in linn to  marcus was to remain a nonexecutive director ivor tiefenbrun had given up executive duties after being diagnosed with a serious illness the company faced its most significant crisis since its founding when it plunged into the red in  due to escalating costs and weighed down by up to ₤ million in short term debt the distribution deal with loewe television and the partnership to supply aston martin with in car entertainment ice systems were terminated the companys turnover declined by £ million lloyds tsb the companys bank put linn on its special measures list and installed a troubleshooter on the board to redress and restructure the business in  the bank ordered asset disposals all properties except the headquarters was earmarked for sale linn shed twothirds of its staff including then managing director peter murphy and some senior managers at some point after march  linn closed the original factory that was next door to castle precision engineering run by ivors brother on drakemire drive thus the metalworking and training facility were moved into the eaglesham facility  – ds digital streaming becomes new company strategyedit linn was one of the first audio manufacturers to understand the likely impact of the internet and the future importance of the network which became the focus of the company’s new strategy under its ds  digital streaming – product development planthe first product to be introduced under the new strategy was the klimax ds network music player linn’s first product to support the playback of bit khz studio master quality recordings from a digital stream over a home networkthe linn records website – wwwlinnrecordscom  was the first site to sell drmfree bit studio master quality tracks downloaded over the internet the pioneering availability of studio master bit khz and introduction of the first linn ds network music player combined to set the company’s path for the future ivors son gilad was promoted from head of engineering to managing director in april  and ivor was brought back with executive responsibilities in february  gilad tiefenbrun was officially named managing director of the company ivor remains executive chairman  – dsi  label of the yearedit the majik dsi was launched as the first linn ds player to integrate a preamplifier allowing connected sources to be streamed onto a network and received by any other linn ds player located throughout the home as a result linn retired the dedicated knekt multiroom system in october linn records was awarded label of the year by gramophone magazine referencing the company’s ongoing commitment to improving the quality of the recording process and distributing music online at studio master quality   kiko systemedit linn launched its first compact lifestyle system called kiko available in five colours but only as a complete system comprising a dsm and dedicated active speakers critical reaction confirmed that the combination offered the performance of much larger systems kiko was awarded best music system £ in both  and  by what hifi magazine   th anniversaryedit linn celebrated its th anniversary with a limited edition sondek lp launched in partnership with specialist whisky distiller highland park the th anniversary lp was produced as limited run of  individually numbered units featuring linns highest sondek specification and including a plinth sourced from yearold highland park whisky barrels the anniversary sondeks were also supplied with a dual branded bottle of yearold highland park single malt whisky   exakt  the system is in the speakeredit exakt technology has been described by the company as its most important development since the introduction of the original sondek turntable exakt was designed to eliminate many of the sources of loss inherent in the traditional analogue hifi chain by keeping the bit lossless signal in the digital domain all the way to the loudspeaker and converting to analogue at the latest possible stage exakt effectively turns the speaker into an intelligent network connected software upgradeable product inside each exakt loudspeaker is a proprietary digital platform  called the exakt engine by linn  that allows the company to claim such performanceenhancing capabilities as the complete elimination of phase and magnitude distortion plus the ability to also offer room optimisation exakt was initially launched as a klimax top level system to the highest critical acclaim in  the room optimization capabilities of exakt were released as a free software upgrade to all nonexakt products under the name space  exakt range extendededit the exakt range was extended to include two new systems exakt akubarik and the first stand mount speaker version exakt akudorik which also received the highest critical acclaim   tidal integration with linn ds playersedit in late  linn announced the availability of lossless music streaming service tidal tidal service on linn ds digital players to provide access to a cdquality library of over  million audio tracks using the internet     the return to sustained profitability and growthedit in november  linn announced its sixth continuous year of profitability with revenue also continuing to grow in five of the previous six years the company had continued to allocate a significant percentage of its turnover to rd throughout the previous eight years with the focus on the ds strategy of studio master quality audio delivered over the network extended more latterly with the development of exakt technology all have combined to have a positive impact on turnover and profitability partnershipsedit during much of the s and s linn adopted a tight working relationship with naim audio it all started in about  when linn was looking for suitable amplifiers to drive their isobarik loudspeaker and came across verekers nap  their product ranges were complementary and their names were often mentioned together being an engineering company linn had the electromechanical part of the chain while naim worked exclusively on the electronics during this time the linnnaim system was a preferred combination for many audiophiles the two companies advocated a sourcefirst philosophy based on the same principle as garbage in garbage out – that an amplifier that correctly performed its role would only faithfully amplify a signal but that all things being equal a superior source component would allow the recorded music to better connect with the listener on an emotive level it followed that a superior source signal paired with lesser amplification would sound better than an inferior source through highquality amplification and speakers this flew in the face of conventional wisdom that had been made prevalent by edgar villchur in line with the philosophy of the comparative demonstration the companies dealers eschewed multispeaker demonstrations with switched comparators to singlespeaker dem rooms the two companies had almost the same sales and marketing strategy and shared many of the same retailersdealers since many of the principles the two companies subscribed to were thought to be heretical or flying in the face of conventional wisdom linnnaim aficionados were nicknamed flat earthers sometimes affectionately sometimes derogatorily the two companies diverged during the s at the dawn of digital audio in  linn formed a brand partnership to supply audio systems to aston martin cars linn supplied amplification and loudspeaker systems for the vanquish and db models but three years later was replaced by alpine electronics the previous supplier awards and recognitionedit ivor tiefenbrun was awarded the mbe by hm queen elizabeth ii in for his and his companys engineering achievements and outstanding service to the electronics industry as of  january  linn products ltd has been awarded the royal warrant of appointment as a tradesman to his royal highness charles prince of wales as a provider of entertainment systems linn was awarded the queens award for enterprise in innovation in  products and trademarksedit linn have a number of trademarks for their products many of which have the characteristic k in place of a hard c the origins of this practice have been relayed in a number of ways during linns history ivor tiefenbrun stated it is a contraction of both sound deck and the word soundex as all designs have their own unique recognisable sound several of the names have scottish origins eg kairn keltik ekos keilidh cairn celtic ecosse ceilidh some have relevance to the function they perform eg knekt a system to connect many rooms together or klout a powerful amplifier more recently some names are derived from descriptives of quality exakt klimax

point bearing which was the usp of the lp turntable hamish robertson designed the ariston rd in  with castle precision engineering ltd machining many of the parts robertson left ariston which had been taken over by dunlop westayr ltd and reorganised as ariston audio ltd in february  linn products ltd was formed to sell turntables made by castle precision engineering this was officially announced in an advertisement in hifi news  record review with the following text the turntable previously available under the name ariston rd is now available under the name linn lp there were claims and even patent litigation at the time that the first linn sondek lp was a carbon copy of the rd and many parts interchangeable ultimately the patent was awarded successfully to linn the companys philosophy is as controversial as its founder who is known for his believing in only two ways of doing things – the linn way and the wrong way whilst many in the industry speak of them in strictly reverential terms notable critic ken kessler accuses the company with a touch of hyperbole of being doctrinaire prone to propaganda brainwashing historical revisionism and other ways of interpreting reality as such and because linn supposedly design their products within the context of an alllinn system they try to ensure that all the variables are covered in a proper demonstration sondek lpedit the lp working with a linn ekos tonearm main article linn sondek lp the sondek lp is a suspended subchassis turntable with a singlepoint platter bearing from its introduction in  there have not been any radical changes to the turntable design which remains in production however the lps sound quality has been improved through retrofittable upgrade kits the successive upgrades consist mostly of refinements in materials used and improved manufacturing tolerances in  some thirty years after the birth of the compact disc sales of the lp and accessories still accounted for  percent of the companys turnover in  linn patented its isobaric loading principle and launched the linn isobarik loudspeaker initially linn manufactured the lp itself but not any other components such as tonearms and cartridges this gap was filled with a largely complementary range from amongst others supex cartridges grace and sumiko tonearms and naim audio amplification digital compact discedit linns first cd player the karik was released in  –  years after the cd format itself the sondek cd pioneered by alan clark was launched in  in  it was discontinued when philips ended production of the laser around which the player was designed on  november  linn said it would stop making cd players to focus on digital streaming products instead  crisisedit in may  linn announced that founder ivor tiefenbrun would relinquish the position of linns managing director in favour of fd and company secretary peter murphy an year veteran of the firm as part of his succession planning tiefenbrun had appointed him to the linn board in november  as the obvious successor in the short term along with his elder son natan at around that time tiefenbrun executed a share swap with his brother marcus in exchange for his shares in castle precision engineering consolidating his stake in linn to  marcus was to remain a nonexecutive director ivor tiefenbrun had given up executive duties after being diagnosed with a serious illness the company faced its most significant crisis since its founding when it plunged into the red in  due to escalating costs and weighed down by up to ₤ million in short term debt the distribution deal with loewe television and the partnership to supply aston martin with in car entertainment ice systems were terminated the companys turnover declined by £ million lloyds tsb the companys bank put linn on its special measures list and installed a troubleshooter on the board to redress and restructure the business in  the bank ordered asset disposals all properties except the headquarters was earmarked for sale linn shed twothirds of its staff including then managing director peter murphy and some senior managers at some point after march  linn closed the original factory that was next door to castle precision engineering run by ivors brother on drakemire drive thus the metalworking and training facility were moved into the eaglesham facility  – ds digital streaming becomes new company
