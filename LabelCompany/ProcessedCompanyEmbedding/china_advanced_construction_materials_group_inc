cement is a commodity and is merely one ingredient in the chemically engineered mixed product that is concrete what is concrete concrete is one of the most essential construction materials it is economical offers continuity and solidity and bonds with other materials the active ingredients in concrete are cement and water which when combined create a chemical reaction cement includes the inactive ingredients gravel and sand for cement strength characteristics strength of concrete the compressive strength of concrete is very high but its tensile strength is relatively low since concrete must resist a great deal of stretching bending or twisting it must be reinforced with steel durability of concrete the durability of concrete or its strength is determined largely by the watercement ratio this durability gives concrete the ability to resist deterioration caused by ‘wear and tear’ and exposure to the elements the character size and grading of the aggregate also have important effects on both strength and durability however the character size and grading of the aggregate also have important effects on both strength and durability water tightness of concrete in order to keep the concrete as watertight as possible the amount of water used must be minimized to achieve the necessary degree of workability concrete is also strong and fireproof concrete that is subject to wear such as floor slabs and pavements must be capable of resisting abrasion concrete has a wide variety of applications all important building elements foundations columns walls slabs and roofs are made from concrete concrete is also used in the construction of roads runways bridges and dams what is cement most cement used today is portland cement this is a combination of lime silica iron oxide and alumina it is usually manufactured from limestone mixed with shale clay or marl the major use of cement is for the production of concrete which is one of the best hardwearing construction materials available tthe other important application of cement is for the production of mortar which is used primarily for joining bricks blocks or stones in walls cement can also be used independently as a grouting material in modern technology cement is also used in the process of solidificationstabilization that is a technique used for the removal of contaminated wastes another significant use of cement is in the engineered soils by which the poor quality soils are improved by the addition of cement after which the soils are usable as a base for foundations for different constructions the production of cement causes a number of harmful effects to the environment including significant carbon dioxide emissions additional pollution is generated by the release of dust and gases from the operation of machinery and blasting conducted in the quarries appropriate equipment is used to minimize the dust emissions and to separate gases in order to reduce the harmful effects on the environment cement is a commodity concrete is a value added product chad syverson associate professor of economics university of chicago states a good place to start is to clear up some confusion that i constantly encounter first cement and concrete are not the same thing even though the two terms are often used interchangeably in conversation concrete comprises the roads we drive on and the buildings in which we live and work cement is an ingredient in concrete it is mixed with sand gravel water and small amounts of chemical admixtures to make concrete cement holds the key reagent that allows concrete to harden through a chemical reaction called hydration into a useful structural material but it is worthless for such purposes if used by itself referring to concrete as cement is a bit like referring to bread as flour a second confusion is that the readymixed alternatively readymix concrete industry is the same as the industry of precast or prefabricated concrete products readymixed concrete is the fluid form of concrete delivered to construction sites in the familiar barrelbacked mixer trucks not cement trucks and poured into a desired shape precast or prefabricated concrete products like block brick pipe and reinforced structural members are instead made by pouring concrete into molds and curing them on the factory site in the government industrial classification systems readymix concrete is sic  or naics  while precast or prefabricated concrete products are classified separately as sics  and  or naics  and  chad syverson chad syverson is

item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations overview we are a holding company whose primary business operations are conducted through our whollyowned subsidiaries xin ao construction materials inc bviacmbeijing ao hang construction material technology co ltd chinaacmh and our variable interest entity beijing xinao concrete group xin ao and its subsidiaries we engage in the production and supply of advanced construction materials for large scale commercial residential and infrastructure developments and are primarily focused on producing and supplying a wide range of advanced readymix concrete materials for highly technical large scale and environmentallyfriendly construction projects that are mainly sold in the peoples republic of china prc during the nine months ended march   we supplied materials and provided services to our projects through one readymixed concrete plant in beijing our management believes that we have the ability to capture a greater share of the beijing market via expanding relationships and networking signing new contracts and continually developing marketleading innovative and ecofriendly readymix concrete products principal factors affecting our financial performance we believe that the following factors will continue to affect our financial performance       large scale contractor relationships we have contracts with major construction contractors that are constructing key infrastructure commercial and residential projects our sales efforts focus on largescale projects and large customers which place large recurring orders and present less credit risk to us for the nine months ended march   one customer accounted for approximately  of our sales should we lose any large scale customers in the future and are unable to obtain additional customers our revenues will suffer           experienced management managements technical knowledge and business relationships give us the ability to secure major infrastructure projects which provides us with leverage to acquire less sophisticated operators increase production volumes and implement quality standards and environmentally sensitive policies if there were to be any significant turnover in our senior management it could deplete the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team           innovation efforts we strive to produce the most technically and scientifically advanced products for our customers and maintain close relationships with tsinghua university xian university of architecture and technology and beijing dongfang jianyu institute of concrete science  technology we entered technical service contracts with these research institutes to further improve our production and products if our research and development efforts are not sufficient to adapt to the change in technology in the industry our products may not compete effectively           competition our competition includes a number of stateowned and large private prcbased manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours we compete primarily on the basis of quality technological innovation and price essentially all of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process with award contracts often being made awarded to the lowest bidder though other factors such as shorter schedules or prior experience with the customer are often just as important within our markets we compete with many national regional and local state owned and private construction entities some of which have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us in addition there are a number of larger national companies in our industry that could potentially establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets our relative market share and

products for the three months ended march   we generated total revenue of approximately  million as compared to approximately  million during the three months ended march   a decrease of approximately  million or  the decrease in revenue was principally due to decreased sales volume by  because of the strengthened result of the prc governments increased inspections of overloaded transportation vehicles which also affected our sales of our concrete truck transportation services the decrease in revenue was offset by the increase in our selling price of concrete by  during the three months

million for the three months ended march   as compared to approximately  million for the three months ended march   a decrease of approximately  million or  the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily associated with the decrease of production volume and the decrease of unit production costs mainly caused by the decrease of concrete truck rental expenses after the termination of our operating lease for our concrete plant in the eastern suburban area of beijing and because we had fewer repair expenses for our own trucks in our manufacturing overhead cost during the three months

operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations we engage in the production of advanced construction materials for large scale infrastructure commercial and residential developments our business is capital intensive and we are highly leveraged debt financing in the form of shortterm bank loans loans from related parties and bank acceptance notes have been utilized to finance our

additional to cash onhand and restricted cash we also have other current assets mainly composed of accounts receivables and prepayments and advances to suppliers although we believe that we can realize our current assets our ability to repay our current obligations will depend on the future realization of our current assets management has considered historical experience the economic environment trends in the construction industry the expected collectability of accounts receivable and the realization of the prepayments on inventory and provided for an allowance for doubtful accounts as of march   we expect to realize balances net of allowance within the normal operating cycle of a twelvemonth period if we are unable to realize our current assets within the normal twelvemonth operating cycle we may have to consider supplementing our available sources of funds through the following      financial support and credit guarantee commitments from our shareholders            other available sources of financing from prc banks and other financial institutions given our credit history based on the above considerations management is of the opinion that we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due however there is no assurance that management will be successful in their plans there are a number of factors that could potentially arise that could undermine the companys plans such as changes in the demand for our products economic conditions competitive pricing in the concretemix industry our

any plans for expansion loan facilities  we had a total of approximately  million and  million outstanding on loans and credit facilities as of march   and june   respectively see note  to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis principles of consolidation the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of china acm and its wholly owned subsidiaries bviacm chinaacmh and its variable interest entity xin ao collectively the company all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation in accordance with fasb asc  consolidation of variable interest entities variable interest entities or vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes in connection with the adoption of this asc the company concludes that xin ao is a vie and china acm is the primary beneficiary the financial statements of xin ao is consolidated with china acms financial statements use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts deferred taxes and prepayments and advances stockbased compensation and fair value and useful lives of property plant and equipment actual results could be materially different from those estimates  revenue recognition revenue is realized or realizable and earned when four criteria are met      persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company considers its sales contracts to be pervasive evidence of an arrangement      delivery has occurred      the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and      collectability of payment is reasonably assured the company sells its concrete products primarily to major local construction companies sales agreements are signed with each customer the agreements list all terms and conditions with the exception of delivery date and quantity which are evidenced separately in purchase orders the purchase price of products is fixed in the agreement and customers are not permitted to renegotiate after the contracts have been signed each agreement includes a cancellation clause if the company or the customers breach the contract terms specified in the agreement the company recognizes revenue when title and ownership of the goods are transferred upon shipment to the customer by the company and collectability of payment is reasonably assured the company includes the shipping and handling fee in both revenue and cost of revenue financial instruments us gaap regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements define fair value establish a threelevel valuation hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs are defined as follows level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest accounts and notes receivable we extend unsecured credit to our customers in the normal course of business accounts are considered past due after  days in establishing the required allowance for doubtful accounts management considers historical experience the economic environment trends in the construction industry and the expected collectability of the overdue receivable management reviews its accounts receivable each reporting period to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate an estimate for doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovering is considered remote we provide a provision of  of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable balance that are past due more than  days but less than one year  of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable past due from one to two years  of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable past due beyond two years  of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable past due beyond three years plus additional amount as necessary which our collection department had determined the collection of the full amount is remote with the approval from our management to provide a  provision allowance for doubtful accounts our management have continued to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary  notes receivable represent trade accounts receivable from various customers where the customers banks have guaranteed such customers obligation the notes are noninterest bearing and typically have a three or six month maturity date the notes are generally charged with a transaction fee of  of the notes amount the company has the ability to submit requests for payment to a customers bank earlier than the scheduled maturity date subject to a discount on interest charged and a processing fee accounting for longlived assets we classify our longlived assets into i machinery and equipment ii transportation equipment iii office and equipment and iv buildings and improvements longlived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable it is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other industry changes if circumstances require a longlived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value if the carrying value of the longlived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and thirdparty independent appraisals as considered necessary if the value of an asset is determined to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less disposition costs due to recurring losses the deterioration of the concretemix industry in beijing prc and because of competitive pricing pressures we have performed an impairment analysis and determined our onglived assets are impaired as a result we recorded an impairment charge of  million for the year ended june   these charges were related to the impairment of our transportation equipmentplants and machinery the loss was determined using level  inputs there was no impairment charge for the nine months ended march   and  competitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect the companys estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by longlived assets and thus could result in future impairment losses income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes which requires us to use the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes under the assets and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forward under this accounting standard the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot criteria should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred united states federal state and local income tax returns prior to  are not subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders  recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note  of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk while we have shortterm bank loans outstanding although interest rates for our shortterm loans are typically fixed for the terms of the loans the terms are typically twelve months and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal interest rates are approximately  for rmb bank loans with a term of twelve months or less credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk from its cash in bank and fixed deposits and accounts and notes receivable other receivables and advances on equipment purchases the credit risk on cash in bank and fixed deposits is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial institutions however the companys cash in bank deposited in the financial institutions in the prc is not insured accounts and notes receivable other receivables and advances on inventory purchases are subjected to credit evaluations an allowance has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts which have been determined by reference to past default experience and the current economic environment foreign exchange risk the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by among other things changes in the prcs political and economic conditions the rmb does not fluctuate with the us dollar although the peoples bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant shortterm fluctuations in the exchange rate the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term in august  the prcs currency dropped by a cumulative  against the us dollar on hopes of boosting the domestic economy making prc exports cheaper and imports into the prc more expensive by that amount the effect on trade can be substantial the trend of depreciation of rmb continued in the year  and the three months ended march   compared with the lowest point from rmb versus us dollars in  the rmb has depreciated by  compared to the exchange rate as of march   moreover it is possible that in the future prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in rmb but our reporting currency is the us dollar fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in us dollars in addition appreciation or depreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we might issue in the future that will be exchanged into us dollars and earnings from and the value of any dollardenominated investments we make in the future very limited hedging transactions are available in the prc to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all in addition our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currencies most of the transactions of the company are settled in rmb and us dollars in the opinion of the directors the company is not exposed to significant foreign currency risk inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of raw materials and overhead costs could impair our operating results inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the nine months ended march   a high rate of inflation in the future may have a continued adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs  item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we
