voyagedallas staff share tweet pin today we’d like to introduce you to roslynn williams thanks for sharing your story with us roslynn so let’s start at the beginning and we can move on from there at the age of  or  i would go with my aunt and volunteer with convoy of hope she had a foot ministry and we would clean and massage the feet of the homeless i remember one year she had some of her students from ogle come this homeless man came to our tent and no one wanted to touch him my aunt grabbed all her supplies and treated him like royalty when he got up the joy in his eyes brought me to tears i knew then at that very moment i wanted to help people with massage but life happens…i got pregnant married and then divorced  years later the uncertainty of making a living in massage therapy was too great when being a single parent i went to college for criminal justice instead i played it safe to provide for my daughter in  my daughter kassandra started her senior year i was just released from the city of fort worth due to car accident and fmla running out i was sitting at a friend’s house and a commercial came on for texas center for massage therapy i’ve seen this commercial a thousand times but never heard they offered financial aid until that day i called and scheduled a tour i had no job nor money but i started classes a week later anyway found a fulltime job left my house at am and returned after pm monday thru thursday a year later kassandra graduates high school and i graduate massage school the best decision of my life we’re always bombarded by how great it is to pursue your passion etc – but we’ve spoken with enough people to know that it’s not always easy overall would you say things have been easy for you it hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows…actually still waiting for those days upon graduating i went all in as an entrepreneur i’ve lost everything to follow my purpose…my home car belongings slept in my car on occasions living with my daughter and her boyfriend i’m looking for a building now and it’s hard without working capital building solid clientele has been challenging but when asked would i change anything…no i absolutely love what i do and will surrender everything to do it things are starting to look up and my business is getting noticed so as you know we’re impressed with roslynn’s healing touch – tell our readers more for example
