competitive landscapeoverall scoreproduct  marketteamtractionterms of offeringrisk reward profile share tweet pin share submit post hops and grain overview hops and grain is an award winning craft brewery based out of austin texas since opening in  hops and grain’s sustainable brewing practices and experimental beers have kept their austin taproom full of onsite drinkers while they continue to expand their wholesale distribution revenues from that austin facility exceeded  million in  and now hops and grain are looking to open a new location in nearby san marcos that will help them expand their capacity from  barrels of beer to  to help finance that new facility hops and grain is offering up to  million in revenue based loans on wefunder investors in those loans will receive  of all revenues earned at the new san marcos facility until their loan has been paid back with an additional  return i invested  in hops and grain for the reasons outlined above and described in detail below to learn more about this new world of investment crowdfunding and how i analyze potential investments head to krowdfundcominvest necessary legalese disclaimer the views expressed in this post are my personal opinions i arrived at when deciding to invest my own personal funds in hops and grain since i am not a professional  licensed financial advisor and since i do not know your unique financial situation none of the opinions expressed on my site should be taken as personal investment advice nor should it be considered a solicitation for investment as i am not affiliated with hops and grain although i have chosen to invest  in the business you should conduct your own due diligence andor consult a professional financial advisor before making your own decision to invest  product  market all photo credits to hops and grain  wefunder josh hare opened the doors to hops and grain in  with a focus on sustainable brewing practices including canning not bottling their beers that first east austin location has gone on to hit nearly  million in annual sales and has created a lineup of beers that includes a world beer cup gold medal winner although their limited production capacity has kept them from distributing widely i’ve come across a can or two of the pale dog pale ale in my beer shop browsings and remember enjoying the balance between the crisp hops and malty backbone but in today’s world of user generated reviews you don’t have to take my word on the quality of the beer hops and grain has averaged a score of  out of  on popular beer review sites beer advocate and untappd considering my favorite local beer the  hop drop ‘n roll ipa which won a world beer cup gold medal in the super competitive americanstyle ipa category scored just a  out of  that  average score for the entire lineup of hops and grain beers is pretty impressive much like many of the other  craft breweries in operation across the us hops and grain sells their beer to patrons for on site consumption in a tap room where profit margins can exceed  however according to hops and grain’s wefunder investment page  of their beer production gets sold to wholesale distributors split almost evenly between draft kegs and canned beers when distributors get involved profit margins take a serious haircut with hop and grain claiming their wholesale margins are somewhere between  and  it should be mentioned now that investors in hops and grain’s wefunder offering will be investing only in the new san marcos facility or as the wefunder page states “separate entity same brand” the new san marcos location will be located between austin and san antonio and will also have a tap room but in a town of just  versus the k in austin we can assume that most of the  barrels of brewing capacity will be going out the doors to distributors hops and grain’s brand recognition in texas has allowed those distributors to get austinproduced beers on the shelves of places like whole foods and trader joes but as this new capacity will allow them to widen their geographic reach hops and grain will surely face some stiff competition from those other  american craft breweries i mentioned earlier but getting mass distribution of your brewery’s brew is the way to strike it rich in this industry just look at ballast point the san diegobased craft brewery that was recently purchased for one billion dollars by corona  model owner constellation brands unfortunately for investors considering hopping on hop and grain’s wefunder offering potential returns will be capped at just x your investment more on that below but for my product and market rating while i think beer drinkers will always find a way to get their hands on good beer it will still be an uphill battle for hops and grain to get more shelf space as they begin competing in the competitive nationwide beer market my product  market rating  team former professional triathlete josh hare founded hops and grain in  after he couldn’t shake the idea to start up a craft brewery in his neighborhood of east austin since then he’s brought on other team members that have helped him continuously expand austin’s operational capacity revenues and tap room crowds while that management team will help oversee the new san marcos location it’s just a  minute or so drive after all the new location’s success really depends on hiring and maintaining quality employees for that new location hops and grain recognizes that fact and states on their wefunder page “the biggest thing that we’ve found as far as the challenges is finding and retaining good people we’ve got an incredible management team in place in austin that will be able to really help communicate the culture to the employees underneath them at both facilities that’s the most important thing in retaining staff knowing that we don’t have to start from scratch on a management team at the new facility will really help mitigate some of the risk” while that management team certainly does mitigate some of the risk it’s still an unknown for investors and since wefunder investors will be reliant on the san marcos location to return their capital i had to reflect that uncertainty in my team rating my team rating  traction again wefunder investors will be reliant on the yettoopen san marcos facility to pay back their loan and return a potential profit more details in the terms of offering section if instead we could invest in the total hops and grain business including the austin location that is expected to clear  million in revenues in  this would be a slam dunk investment but the new san marcos facility will still greatly benefit from the groundwork the austin location has achieved with good award winning beer and solid distributor relationships san marcos has put many of the normal risks a new brewery faces behind them now they just need to focus on building a high quality facility and hiring good people if they can do that and the craft beer industry doesn’t fall off a cliff hops and grain san marcos should be able to generate the revenue needed to pay back investors so even though there is still a lot of work to be done to get san marcos up and running the traction that hops and grain austin has already established factored heavily into my traction rating my traction rating  terms of offering so we’ve got good beer good people and a good history but the terms of hops and grain’s crowdfund investment offering is where things went south for me had hops and grain offered a tiny sliver of equity or a smaller percentage of revenues for their entire operation i would be much more bullish on this crowdfunding investment opportunity instead hops and grain llc the existing business in austin has created a new legal entity specific to the san marcos location hops and grain production llc which is who wefunder “investors” are lending to wefunder investors will provide up to  million in cash to help get the production facility at san marcos up and running and in exchange for that capital investment hops and grain production will on an annual basis beginning one year from opening start sending  of all revenues derived from that san marcos location to those investors once investors are paid back their initial investment and a return of  the revenue loan will be paid in full and hop and grain’s obligation to investors will have been satisfied while most investment crowdfunding offerings sell an actual ownership percentage of the business to investors there is one distinct advantage to the revenue based financing that hops and grain production is offering while equity investors may have to wait years for the company to turn a profit or get acquired before receiving cash flows from their investment hops and grain investors will receive ongoing cash distributions equating to  of the san marcos facility’s revenues unfortunately as more people invest in the offering there will be “more mouths to feed” from that  slice of the revenue pie which means it will take longer for everybody to earn their money back plus the promised  return so how long will it take to pay investors back if hops and grain raise the full  million ceo josh hare stated on the company’s wefunder page that he expects it to take between  and  years for investors to receive their full x return when i asked for san marcos’s sales forecasts on hops and grain’s wefunder page josh replied “at max capacity in our new facility we can generate close to m annually we will be building the facility out to have max production capacity from day  and i anticipate that we’ll reach that maximum revenue point between years ” if they are able to achieve and sell through that max production capacity by year  hops and grain will have no problem returning the full  to investors well by year  regardless of how much money they end up raising but as shown by the charts below if sales are slow to pick up or hops and grain san marcos experiences delays in opening their new facility the length of time it time it takes to get paid back will stretch out and the rate of return investors will achieve will drop precipitously keep in mind that the figures shown below are my own “back of the napkin” assumptions but they show how widely returns can vary with “irr” being the internal rate of return on the amount invested irr is a good way to analyze the average rate of return of an investment that doesn’t return its capital in one lump sum liquidity event such as an acquisition or ipo my “best case” scenario raise  million no sales in year  buildout of facility sell  of production capacity in year  and sell  in year  and beyond  investment  of revenues net cash flow irr year    year    year     year     year     year     scenario  raise  million no sales in year  buildout of facility sell  of production capacity in year   million  in year   in year  and  in year  and beyond investment  of revenues net cash flow irr year    year    year     year     year     year     year     scenario  raise  million no sales in year  or  delays in buildout of facility sell  of production capacity  million in year  and grow  each year from there investment  of revenues net cash flow irr year    year    year    year     year     year     year     year     year     year     year     based on those assumptions it could take wefunder investors anywhere from  to  years just to get their initial investment back and as much as ten to receive their full  profit but those scenarios don’t take into account far gloomier possibilities what happens if we are in fact in a craft beer bubble and it pops or what if the san marcos facility is a complete bust for some other reason hopefully that won’t be the case but if that were to occur investors couldn’t rely on the existing austin operations to pay them back since that llc is not a liable party on the loan agreement instead the only option investors would have would be to hope to sell off the assets of the san marcos brewery which the loan agreement grants them a security interest in if the brewery does go belly up i’m guessing it will be in part due to an economic environment that would be tough to sell used brewery equipment into so investors would likely be better off just asking for the leftover inventory and having themselves a nice little going out of business party with that possibility in mind a  return seems like a fair return given the risks involved and while i will gladly take an  return on my investment and spend it on the cases of hops and grain beer that will surely be popping up in north carolina by  at that lower rate of return i would have been better off just sticking my money in less risky publicly traded stocks or bonds which historically have averaged between  to  returns given the variability of those returns and the risks involved i had to score the terms of hops and grain’s offering pretty low my terms rating  risk reward profile given hg austin’s success since  if hops and grain were offering even  to  of their entire operation austin and san marcos i would give this riskreward rating a  as it is however investors are depending on the new san marcos facility to open on schedule within a year and quickly ramp up production to get paid back and eventually make money if any significant delays occur in construction or permitting or if hops and grain sees a drop in demand for any reason it could take investors a decade or more to eventually receive the full x investment return they are promised on the other hand if everything goes to plan and the world falls in love with hops and grain’s line of canned beers equity owners of the company mostly founders and management will be scroogemcduckdiving into their piles of gold long after the loan obligation to wefunder investors has been paid and fully satisfied my riskreward score therefore reflects the fact that there is a decent amount of risk here but none of the unlimited financial upside that equity ownership offers my risk reward rating  conclusion with an overall score of  hops and grain still falls within the range i consider acceptable as a suitable crowdfund investment seeing as how i’ve always wanted to be a part owner of a brewery and since i should begin seeing some cash flows in as little as  months i decided to add hops and grain to my personal investment crowdfunding portfolio with a  investment to follow the progress of my entire portfolio check out my portfolio page if

taught th grade science but i never stopped thinking about beer in  i finally scratched that itch and opened hops  grain say hello to our beers i write all of our recipes myself but it really starts from my conversations with our customers—they tell me what flavors theyve been craving or the crazy ideas they have our product lineup is a reflection of our biggest fans   is brewed in the style of a

for dryhopping in order to give you a different aroma and flavor experience with every new batch porter culture our baltic porter starts with a base of pilsner and munich malts and we layer in chocolate wheat and debittered black malt to provide flavors of coffee dark chocolate raisins and just a hint of roast a neutral yeast profile lets the malts take center stage a pale mosaic american

with a small amount of vienna and caramel malts to add distinct character and a mouthful of hoppiness the one they call zoe it’s similar to old world german lagers but dryhopped to add an extra layer of complexity zoe is based on pale and vienna malts with a beautiful white layer of foam resting on top delivering floral and citrus dryhop aromatics with every sip our first location austin tx we

opportunities more investors more investors details expand all what are you building after  years of rapid growth in our local market we are setting out to build a second production facility and tasting room in san marcos tx with the goal of tripling our current production capacity and reaching a vibrant fast growing market of young professionals we plan to carry our attention to detail adherence to quality standards and devotion to consistency to this new facility we’ll be building a state of the art brewery and a large tasting room and event space for private events as well as weekly hours for sampling and tours our expansion to san marcos will enable us to reach more people introduce new products and bring our capacity from  barrels to  how did you get started my background in beer began in college as a young biology student i attended small university that didn’t allow alcohol consumption during your tenure so my buddies and i found that you could purchase all the ingredients to make beer without being legal drinking age it began as more of an experiment and ultimately turned into a pretty elaborate homebrew operation years later i was just as in love with homebrewing as when i started so i began pitching this idea of building a brewery that not only makes great beer but markets it to this huge community of people that love to get outside love to eat good food and love to support local why open up in east austin for the  years that i’ve lived in austin i’ve always resided in east austin it’s a rapidly developing area that has seen a lot of changes in the  years that i’ve been here historically the neighborhood has been rooted in rd th th generation families that really really love their neighborhood they like the idea of not having to drive all the way across town to go to a grocery store you kind of have everything it’s a self sustaining community—but it lacked a brewery having lived there and fallen in love with the neighborhood it seemed like a perfect fit for a brewery what do you think a local brewery adds to the community what i fell in love with was this romantic vision of a brewery in the middle of a neighborhood with huge vent stacks on the roof and steam coming out the top of it the neighborhood brewery as major cities like austin and denver continue to grow in numbers and space it’s becoming more and more important to provide access to what makes our cities great without having to drive an hour to get to them austin receives an incredible amount of tourism because of our reputation as such a locally committed city visitors say they love the local feel of austin the local feel that they recognize and enjoy in austin is being in the middle of a neighborhood and popping into a restaurant or a bar or a brewery so when it came to opening a brewery there were no other options for me what makes your brand unique the beer that we produce is one component but the story that we tell is what brings people back time and again for us our story is about our focus on the community we make beers that we believe are culturally relevant rather than going in and saying “these are the beers that we like to drink enjoy it or not” we like to open our doors invite people in and hear what the community wants there are elements of it that scream austin our product is build on quality early on we made a huge investment in an onsite lab you can get people to drink your beer once but if you want them to drink it twice it needs to be consistent and it needs to be high quality and it needs to taste great our lab is where we ensure that quality at a brewery of our scale it’s unheard of to have the type of equipment that we have in our lab but i believe there’s no way you can scale a brand if you can’t make it over and over and over identical to the way that you did before and continue to grow the quality tell us about the beer lab the first one is our qaqc lab where we test shelf stability storage stability and multiple other data points that ensure we are producing a consistent and high quality product we test every parameter that we can throughout our entire process the second lab is our pilot brewery inside of our facility is this small scaled down replica of our main brew house that produces  gallons per batch that’s the place where we churn out all kinds of experimental beers test out new ingredients and train new staff we only serve those products onsite and we really involve every customer that comes into our tasting room in that process how do you choose your beers and flavors i currently serve the role of brewmaster i write all of our recipes and i oversee quality management the recipes all really start from my conversations with people our product lineup is a reflection of our community once we dial in the concept for a new beer that’s when i sit down and really start to dig into specific recipe formulation from water profiles all the way down to the specific malt and hop varieties from there every beer starts on that small pilot system we brew multiple batches on that system testing out different things testing out feedback from our customers before we ever decide to scale that up and actually put it into a package during that trial and error process is when we start to involve our graphic designer we involve him in the entire evolution of the brand and the story of the brand so that when he starts to put together those visual elements from can design to tap handle to inclusion into our website it’s all consistent how had the business been doing up to now we did not anticipate the overwhelming response that we go when we started selling out beer our projections showed us selling the volume that we currently sell in our th year we almost overnight were completely sold out we basically doubled our production year over year for  straight years our current facility is just about maxed out on available space and capacity so we’ve started installing systems that enable us to yield a little bit more beer out of each tank we are in year  and we still have not been able to expand outside of austin we’re not even able to supply the demand in austin it’s been an incredible experience but it’s also been a stressful experience just trying to balance it out we’ve had to say no a lot over the past year with new accounts because i believe it’s critically important that we maintain inventory at all of our current accounts it’s been frustratingly gratifying what percent of your revenue is from the tap house v distributors  of what we produce in gallons goes out to our wholesalers among that we’re pretty evenly split  between  packs of  oz cans and kegs for draft sales we’ve got a really great presence in heb whole foods central market trader joe’s total wine spec all of the major chain stores here in austin as well as almost  independent liquor stores and corner shops that love to showcase craft beer we have a really great reach in the offpremise channels wit the onpremise side there are literally hundreds of restaurants and bars that are really committed to craft beer here in austin and we service all of those as well the other  of volume is what we pour in our tasting room when you look at revenue though  of our annual revenue comes from our tasting room what kind of margins do you get on beer sold on site v distribution our margins on the beer that goes out into the wholesale market is between  kegs are a little bit higher margin because of the lower packaging cost but all around the margins are very tight when you work with a wholesaler we have to focus on volume to maintain profitability whereas when we make it in house and serve it in house our only overhead is our labor our margins are in the  when we sell it onsite because of our current model of selling a souvenir glass we have the cost of the glass that eats into our margins after all is said and done our cost of goods for that  souvenir glass is nearly  selling it by the glass and not having to sell the actual glass itself but just the liquid that should improve our profit margin another  is selling beer on site or retail distribution more important to the business we get customers that are buying our beer out in the market and then they look up our website and see we have a tasting room and then they come to visit we also have people that find our tasting room first come in and then realize that we also package our beer and the next time they’re at the grocery story they pick up a six pack they really feed each other i think almost equally why are you expanding and how did you choose the new location the plan for this new expansion is to enable our current facility to keep operating at full capacity the new facility in san marcos will also have an onsite tasting room and production space similar to our austin facility san marcos as a city is much easier from a city code perspective than austin which also heavily factored into the decision making san marcos is growing incredibly fast there are almost  students there and a large population of young professionals because the cost of living is much cheaper than austin many people live there and commute into the city we’ve been wanting to expand down into the san antonio market houston el paso and then eventually dallasft worth this second facility will enable us to service all of those new markets the corridor between san antonio and austin is connecting more closely every year san marcos is perfectly positioned between the  cities and there is a lot of commuter traffic up and down that corridor how do you think about competition competition is definitely ramping up in our industry especially when you look at retail shelf space there’s a lot of brands out there a lot of choices which is ultimately why people come to craft beer to begin with because of those choices we want to make beer that’s high quality but it’s the beer that you have in your fridge all the time that’s a big differentiator for us our focus has not just been around making the whales as our industry calls them we make very consistent very high quality very reliable beer from a competition standpoint we own that shelf space how fast have you been growing last year we cleared just over  million in revenue and we should do  million this year because of our continued growth in our tasting room sales we’ve been able to continue that  revenue split each year with our new efficiencies in raw materials purchasing as well as new production efficiencies we’re able to get a little bit higher margin from our wholesale revenue this year is where we’ll see our revenue will grow over  but our production volume will be around  growth something that we’ll take into this new facility is building those efficiencies in from the beginning so we can realize the raw material economies of scale ordering for both facilities have you chosen the site for the new brewery yet we’ve been looking at a lot of properties in san marcos and have a number of great potential sites we’ve already met with the local city and building offices there and have a good idea for the construction timeframe i already know exactly how long the brewing equipment takes to fabricate and make wrapping up the fundraising piece is the next step for us what are the risks and challenges the biggest thing that we’ve found as far as the challenges is finding and retaining good people we’ve got an incredible management team in place in austin that will be able to really help communicate the culture to the employees underneath them at both facilities that’s the most important thing in retaining staff knowing that we don’t have to start from scratch on a management team at the new facility will really help mitigate some of the risk construction permitting is never as easy as you would like for it to be so that’s a challenge as well building in a new city will be a learning experience but knowing and having a great general contractor that has done work in san marcos definitely takes some of the load off i would say some of the biggest challenges are going to be the staffing element and then just getting through the initial construction permitting what are the backgrounds of your teammates our operations manager’s background has been in farming and operations management being in an industry like beer where we produce an agricultural product he’s been a huge asset in really streamlining inventory management staffing and the day to day production and operations then we have our packaging manager who came to us from the petroleum industry working in demolition and excavation and is very operations focused he manages everything from the beer going into kegs and cans all the way downstream to wholesalers picking up from us and managing their inventory our marketing manager came to us from whole foods she was the marketing lead here in austin she’s got an incredible amount of experience both in digital marketing and then also event marketing she manages all of our digital channels social media monthly newsletter yelp our google plus pages all of those elements that ultimately tell our story she also manages all of our onsite events our tap room manager came to us from from boston where she had  years in bar management experience our sales manager spends most of his time out in the field managing both the sales team with our distributors as well as doing higher level account management with our retailers our tap room manager has a great staff underneath her that tells the story directly to our customers on the production side having  people that are really focused around efficiency and have a lot of experience in that has been huge because we’re dealing with farmers and growers all over the country and brokers in the middle and we’re at the mercy of mother nature having people that have worked in industries that understand that and understand how to compensate for it has been huge what are your guiding principles commitment to our industry our community and our environment any time we decide to do anything be it hiring a new employee changing raw materials suppliers writing a new recipe buying glassware for the tasting room we always ask ourselves if we are going to add or bring more sustainability to all three of those areas with that decision if we can say yes then we move forward with that exploration and that’s a huge piece of what we stand for we use  wind energy we make dog treats out of our spent brewing grains and we divert all of our solid waste away from our waste water stream we work with a local company that uses it for compost starter we are a recognized platinum green business leader by the
