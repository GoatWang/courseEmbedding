while these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work which limits their applicationat hitachi we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments it also includes a gripper that automates manual operations such as pulling out shelves and picking out productsthe dual arm robot uses builtin sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked while in motion it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelvesbut there’s more to this robot than order picking with its dual arms this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two armswith the advancement

automation and robotics facilities incorporating industrial automation into their manufacturing processes continually strive to improve efficiency through increased speed and greater precision often the most direct means to achieve these goals is reduced weight and increased stiffness of the robotics and in particular the end effectors lightweight end effectors translate directly to increased speed on the production line higher precision reduced motor and actuator loads and improved reliability for many application such as injection molding a  second reduction in cycle time translates into a yearly savings of  or more one of our customers actually saved  million a year with a custom carbon fiber robotic arm solution we helped them develop dragonplate works with companies in the consumer products semiconductor beverage injection molding aerospace and automotive industries as well as many others that utilize robotics in their manufacturing or inspection processes in addition we work with companies that specialize in the design and fabrication of automated systems to replace their obsolete metal end effectors with lightweight carbon fiber composites with typical weight reductions of  many carbon fiber options are available to robotics and automation designers using basic structural materials flat sheets angles hat stiffeners cchannels rectangular tubes lightweight end effectors can easily be designed and implemented often into existing manufacturing lines with minimal other changes with relative ease  pound end effectors can be reduced to  pounds or less substantially reducing vibration as well as bearing and motor wear by utilizing our dragonplate tube connector systems a myriad of additional options are available for example square and rectangular tubes can be connected with flat gusset plates creating extremely strong yet lightweight frames pultruded round tubes are easily connected using our patented universal joint connector system to form trusses and our patent pending modular connector system provides an efficient and extremely robust way to make easily disassembled carbon fiber tubular structures out of our braided and rollwrapped round tubes leveraging inhouse finite element analysis cad design and tool making dragonplate regularly works with customers to produce highly specialized robotics and automation end effectors we

a century while focusing on cocreation with clients to generate new value the history of hitachi group’s robotics dates back to the s with our servomanipulator a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operationssince then hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants with hitachi’s rd focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to lifein  hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies by  hitachi proudly introduced emiew a serviceassistance robot that can talk and work with people we’re also focusing on cocreation with clients to generate new value currently we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement highquality prototyping alongside our clients the proliferation of iot in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace this shift has also made realworld applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics as we develop robotics solutions for the age of iot we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward solving today’s challenges for a better future hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers emiew is a human symbiotic robot that actively communicates with people emiew draws from hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy a cloudbased it infrastructure serves as a “remote brain” which monitors and controls the robot’s body this brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives emiew the ability to communicate navigate through its surroundings and provide customer support and guidanceby accurately understanding situations in various service settings emiew is able to recognize and approach those in need it can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services — improving user satisfaction and business efficiency for the practical applicationemiew is conducting a demonstration test view more

view more the autonomous mobile dual arm robot that’s pioneering the future of logistics consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result while these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work which limits their applicationat hitachi we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments it also includes a gripper that automates manual operations such as pulling out shelves and picking out productsthe dual arm robot uses builtin sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked while in motion it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelvesbut there’s more to this robot than order picking with its dual arms this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two armswith the advancement of our automation technologies the future of logistics is closer than ever the autonomous mobile dual arm robot is still in its development stages and it is yet to be determined when it will be put to
