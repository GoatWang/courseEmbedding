transform boombust narrative it workers in bangalore  reuters forecasting the success or failure of emerging markets is a tricky game attempts have seen the creation of acronyms like brics and mints they have been the source of dreams dating back to marco polo for every index that suggests renewed optimism about developing economies one can offer up a cautionary counterargumentthe story of emerging markets has historically been one of big booms and busts the asian tigers ran straight into the asian financial crisis  years ago resourcerich countries economies have mirrored cyclical commodity price trends while manufacturing nations have inevitably faltered when their workforces seek less laborintensive positionsbut the underlying story in many emerging markets today particularly in asia will be based on new fundamentals that will help transform the narrative from one of caution to expectations of sustained success this story will be about digital readiness internet technology expertise use and investment by harnessing the power of digital china for example stands to grow its gross domestic product  by  the equivalent of adding  billion to its already huge economyconsider the fundamentals on a broadbrush level most readers intuitively would accept that some emerging markets are home to tech savvy expertsfrom indias information technology campuses in bangalore to israels startup community anecdotal evidence supports the theory of it centers thriving well beyond silicon valley no surprise then that the internet economy is growing  per year in emerging markets according to boston consulting groupon a more granular level there is evidence of a wider pool of talent and greater demand for it in emerging markets than elsewhere earlier this year accenture commissioned research on women in the workforce with an eye to finding out what skills are needed to help women attain pay parity with men one of the ancillary insights the research yielded was that in many emerging markets particularly china women tend to be as schooled in it as men creating a large potential pool of candidates for such workwe found that the digital capabilities of male and female undergraduates in china are fairly equal  of the chinese undergraduate women surveyed said they had taken computing or coding module classes as against  of the men some  of the female students said they felt they adopt new technologies quickly as compared with  of the men a base of nearly universal tech savviness among college graduates is an essential building block for futureready businesses and nations that can rotate to the new world orderconsumption demandto drive economic engines nations need more than just expertise they need consumption once again emerging markets stand out because they need digital services the majority of the worlds  billion unbanked population reside in emerging markets this is leading to significant innovation in mobile and financial technologies market research company berg insight estimates that the number of registered mobile money accounts in emerging markets has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of  and will reach  billion this yearthis consumption demand has attracted investment and much of that is coming from emerging markets into other emerging markets consider the story of indian mobile payment app paytm one of its main investors has been chinas alibaba group holding japans softbank is also a key backerpaytm benefitted late last year from indian prime minster narendra modis effort to cut corruption and increase tax payments by canceling roughly  of paper currency in circulation the mobile payment app became a lifeline for continued business operationsonce people start using digital payments and experience the convenience they stay hooked paytms mobile wallet app now has  million customerstech savvy customer bases dont have to be rich they just need to have a smartphone as we know many people in asia are armed with at least one china and india are in pole position to take advantage of technological knowhow but other techsavvy emerging markets in the region such as indonesia malaysia and thailand show promise due to their willingness to utilize digital solutionthis can be a foundation for continued growth sustained from within which can buffer emerging asia from global booms and busts it also could make emerging markets attractive to global investors those companies that demonstrate a willingness to rotate their core business to the new era by using digital not just to cut costs but across entire businesses  from planning and strategy to making new products selling and managing  are poised for growthskeptics counter that digitization wont drive job creation but the history of innovation shows otherwise with new innovations come new jobs the invention of airplanes meant the creation of positions for engineers pilots and air traffic controllers from transportation to healthcare such employment creation can be outlined think astronauts radiologists and app developers some jobs are lost but new ones are invented often at a higherwage entry level pointwhile economic predictions are
