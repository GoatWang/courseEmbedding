hour this could damage the filter do not use pumps with flows less than  galhr a minimum of  gallons per hour is necessary to perform the backflush operation all pressure filters restrict the flow from your pump expect about a  reduction in the water flow through the filterhow it works mechanical filtration pond water flows down through the bioactivators which remove suspended debris and dirt from the water biological filtration occurs on the massive surface areas found in the bioactivators beneficial bacteria will naturally colonize on the surface area and convert harmful pollutants in the water into relatively harmless nitrate which are absorbed by the aquatic plants and from partial water changes this is known as the nitrogen cycle open profile bioactivators tetraponds new bioactive pressure filters come equipped with openprofile bioactivators which offer superior filtration and backflush performance over closed biomedia and foamthese bioactivators have been perfected and used in the commercial aquaculture industry where demanding filtration is required due to extreme environmental conditions the advanced technological design of the bioactivators provides a large active surface area for the beneficial bacteria to colonizeduring the backflush operation these bioactivators provide unrestricted water flow to all the surfaces so that dirt and debris are thoroughly removed while leaving the beneficial bacteria on the bioactivator surfaces intact and robustfiltration process pump water from the pond to the pressure filter water is mechanically and biologically filtered filtered water is forced up the center tube in models with a uv clarifier the uv light destroys the singlecelled algaes ability to reproduce filtered water is forced under pressure to the waterfall or stream tubing attachment for maximum flow use  inch id tubing also fits  inch id tubingtip for maximum flow attach the largest tubing fitting use a saw to cut the filter outlet  inlet fittings to match the tubing you have selectedhow the greenfree uv clarifier works the tetrapond uv clarifier works by exposing singlecelled algae to very high levels of ultra violet light as the pond water containing them is pumped through the clarifier the water containing singlecelled algae comes in close contact with the light from the uv bulb that is protected from the water by a quartz glass sleevethe ultraviolet radiation disrupts the algaes ability to reproduce the algae die and clump together and then the algae can be easily removed by the bioactivators inside the pressure filterfor most ponds with normal levels of green water algae the clearing process should take about one week however with thicker algal blooms this may take  weeks the uv clarifier will reduce the growth of the algae but water clarity is also dependent on the pond filter removing the dead algaewhen installing the uv clarifier on a pond that already contains green water the clarifying process can be rapidly
