financial planning asset managment insurance management lots of smart successful americans inadvertently invest the hard way the hard way is succumbing to the emotional roller coaster of news and neighbors it’s listening to msnbc cnn and fox news and having your confidence questioned by the catastrophe du jour it is hearing neighbors and colleagues brag about silver bullet strategies or how best to time the market and wondering if you should be following in their footsteps in the hard way investors find this incoming information to be so arresting or compelling that they can’t help

financial all rights reserved phillips financial management llc dba phillips financial an sec registered investment advisor  disclosure documents scroll to top phillips financial  financial planning financial planning – phillips financial financial planning financial planning asset managment insurance management many smart consumers aren’t aware there is a profound difference between receiving sound bites of planning advice in the process of getting your investments managed – and the experience of going through an intentional financial planning process an intentional financial planning process involves deep discussion regarding your aspirations and concerns for the future of your life your family and your life’s work these are not questions checked off a shortlist they are robust conversations that become the landscape for the financial aspects of our working relationship true financial planning also includes collecting your many types of assets and integrating them into a common set of financial projections legal tax and financial disciplines are unavoidably linked through the tax code the financial markets and the economy it is not possible to make efficient strategic decisions about your future without evaluating your total picture with our process – for the first time in most peoples’ lives – they can actually see how their whole financial life comes together what’s the difference between a financial product and a financial plan many traditional approaches to planning attempt to separate the family aspects of planning from the financial decisions also the process is treated as a project suggesting that planning done once can serve the lifetime of the family or business at the end of the day planning is about lives and livelihoods planning done well considers the people and the financials together and the plan itself is cared for consistently over the lifetimes it’s purported to serve download our free report how to overcome the three dysfunctions of traditional planning why pay a fee for financial planning if you’re promised a financial plan for free the methodology itself creates more questions than answers how thorough is your plan if the professionals aren’t being compensated for their time and wisdom if it isn’t thorough which elements have been left out and which opportunities were left unexplored planning without a fee treats the plan itself as a middle man an obstacle in the way of a transaction in our experience at phillips financial planning fees change the way everyone in the relationship thinks about the relationship and how you think about a relationship influences its longterm health and dynamics planning fees signal you and your advisor that it’s time to focus on the plan itself when an advisory relationship begins with a clear commerce exchange there’s no smoke and mirrors in play it sets your clarity as the core objective for the discussions what is fiduciary duty a fiduciary duty is a duty to act in another party’s best interests parties owing to this duty are called fiduciaries they make a professional commitment to disclose and minimize conflicts of interest whenever possible many individuals and families aren’t aware that an advisor’s business model directly affects the standard to which they are held if the advisor is not a fiduciary they can offer you a product and the product simply needs to be a logical choice based on limited information at a specific point in time they are not required to look at your bigger picture  phillips financial all rights reserved
