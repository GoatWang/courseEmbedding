investments and employ certain investment techniques that involve risks including but not limited to investing in foreign securities lending portfolio securities investing in restricted and illiquid securities investing in securities on a whenissued and delayed delivery basis writing put and call options and entering into repurchase agreements the funds net asset value and offering price can be found in the mutual funds section of local newspapers under federated and the appropriate class designation listing investment information investment objective the funds objective is to provide longterm growth of capital any income received from the portfolio is incidental the investment objective cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders while there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective it endeavors to do so by following the investment policies described in this prospectus investment policies the fund pursues its investment objective by investing in shares of other openend management investment companies for which affiliates of federated investors serve as investment adviser and principal underwriter the federated funds and herein referred to as the underlying funds that invest primarily in foreign equity securities the underlying funds in which the fund will invest include but are not limited to federated asia pacific growth fund federated emerging markets fund federated european growth fund federated international small company fund and federated latin american growth fund the charts below show the approximate parameters in which the fund will generally invest in large and small capitalization stocks and in developed and emerging markets the adviser can adjust these ranges from time to time at its sole discretion the prospectus contains two pie charts in the center of the page the first depicts developed vs emerging markets exposure and shows  of assets invested in emerging markets and  of assets invested in developed markets the second chart depicts large capitalization vs small capitalization exposure and shows  of assets invested in small capitalization stocks and  of assets invested in large capitalization stocks under normal circumstances the fund expects to operate within the following ranges federated asia pacific growth fund    federated european growth fund    federated emerging markets fund    federated international small company fund    federated latin american growth fund    the funds strategy of investing in the shares of other international equity funds is designed but not guaranteed to reduce the risk associated with investing in a single sector or regionalspecfic underlying fund holding a diversified portfolio of international equity funds also may provide access to a wider range of companies industries countries and markets than would be available through any one underlying fund international securities and markets are subject to currency rate fluctuations and potentially greater price volatility and liquidity considerations than us securities investors have historically sought to reduce these risks through multicountry diversification the fund is designed to give shareholders a single investment that offers broad international diversification under normal market conditions and as an investment policy the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in underlying funds that are international equity funds however as an operational policy the fund anticipates investing substantially all of its assets in international equity funds international equity funds are those which invest primarily in equity securities of companies located in three or more countries outside the united states the adviser will attempt to identify and select a varied portfolio of international equity funds which presents the greatest longterm capital growth potential based on the advisers analysis of many factors the adviser will allocate the funds assets across the underlying funds such that the fund will be exposed to large and small capitalization stocks from both developed and emerging markets outside of the united states small capitalization companies are those companies that have a market capitalization of  billion or less at the time of purchase large capitalization companies are those companies that have a market capitalization of over  billion at the time of purchase emerging markets companies are defined as i those for which the principal securities trading market is and emerging market country ii those which are organized under the laws of or with a principal office in an emerging market country or iii those wherever organized or traded who derive directly or indirectly through subsidiaries at least  of their total assets capitalization gross revenue or profit from its most current year from goods produced services performed or sales made in such emerging market countries from time to time the adviser will alter the allocation percentages of the underlying funds based on market risk economic fundamentals and unique market characteristics within the foreign markets an asset classes in which the underlying funds invest the adviser will first assess the relative attractiveness of geographic regions and individual countries after identifying the most and least attractive countries or regions consideration will be given to expected returns and risks before deciding which areas if any to overweight or underweight by rebalancing the fund through investment of the proceeds of new purchases into the fund by making purchases and sales among the shares of the underlying funds or a combination of the two the adviser will continually manage the funds exposure to large and small capitalization stocks from both developed and emerging markets because the fund and the underlying funds may invest in substantially similar securities in a similar fashion thereby incurring similar risks all further references to the fund hereinafter include the underlying funds unless otherwise indicated although many of the underlying funds may have the same or similar investment policies as the fund they are not required to do so assets not invested in international equity funds may be invested in underlying funds other than international equity funds such as global funds funds that invest primarily in securities of issuers throughout the world including the united states the fund also may enter into forward commitments repurchase agreements and foreign currency transactions maintain reserves in foreign or us money market instruments and purchase options and financial futures contracts unless indicated otherwise the investment policies of the fund may be changed by the directors without approval of shareholders shareholders will be notified before any material changes in these policies become effective following the grant of certain exemptive relief from the sec the fund will also be permitted to invest directly in a professionally managed diversified portfolio of equity securities of companies domiciled outside the united states that the adviser believes offer excellent opportunities for longterm growth additionally the fund for liquidity purposes may maintain direct investments in shortterm money market securities however for temporary defensive purposes when the adviser determines that market conditions warrant the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in us and foreign money market instruments to the extent that the funds assets are invested in the underlying funds its investment performance will correspond directly to that of its proportionate investment in those underlying funds this strategy involves certain additional expenses and certain tax results which would not be present in a direct investment in mutual funds see expenses of the fund and sharesand federal tax information the fund may purchase shares of noload funds available without a transaction fee andor pay their own distribution expenses see additional considerations of investing in other investment companieseach underlying fund provides a prospectus and other disclosure documents to the fund these documents are also available to fund shareholders directly from the underlying fund acceptable investments the equity securities in which the fund may invest include common stock preferred stock either convertible or non convertible sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts or shares and warrants including other substantially similar forms of equity with comparable risk characteristics as well as other forms which may be developed in the future securities may be purchased on securities exchanges traded overthecounter or have no organized market the fund may also purchase corporate and government fixed income securities denominated in currencies other than us dollars enter into forward commitments repurchase agreements and foreign currency transactions maintain reserves in foreign or us money market instruments and cash and purchase options and financial futures contracts common and preferred stock stocks represent shares of ownership in a company generally preferred stock has a specified dividend and ranks after bonds and before common stocks in its claim on income for dividend payments and on assets should the company be liquidated after other claims are satisfied common stockholders participate in company profits on a pro rata basis profits may be paid out in dividends or reinvested in the company to help it grow increases and decreases in earnings are usually reflected in a companys stock price so common stocks generally have the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of all corporate securities while most preferred stocks pay a dividend the fund may purchase preferred stock where the issuer has omitted or is in danger of omitting payment of its dividend such investments would be made primarily for their capital appreciation depositary receipts the fund may invest in foreign issuers by purchasing sponsored or unsponsored securities representing underlying international securities such as american depositary receipts adrs american depositary shares adss european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs global depositary certificates gdcs international depositary receipts idrs and russian depositary certificates rdcs or securities convertible into foreign equity securities adrs and adss typically are issued by a united states bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation edrs which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts cdrs gdrs gdcs idrs and rdcs are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they also may be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation adrs adss cdrs debt securities in pursuit of the funds objective of longterm growth of capital the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities capital appreciation in debt securities may arise as a result of favorable changes in the creditworthiness of issuers relative interest rate levels or relative foreign exchange rates any income received from debt securities will be incidental to the funds objective of longterm growth of capital these debt obligations consist of us and foreign government securities and corporate debt securities including but not limited to samurai and yankee bonds eurobonds and depositary receipts the issuers of such debt securities may or may not be domiciled in emerging countries the debt securities in which the fund may invest may be rated at the time of purchase as low as c by standard  poors ratings group sp convertible securities are fixed income securities which may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of the issuers underlying common stock at the option of the holder during a specified time period convertible securities may take the form of convertible bonds convertible preferred stock or debentures units consisting of usable bonds and warrants or a combination of the features of several of these securities the investment characteristics of each convertible security vary widely which allows convertible securities to be employed for a variety of different investment strategies in selecting a convertible security the adviser evaluates the investment characteristics of the convertible security as a fixed income investment and the investment potential of the underlying security for capital appreciation restricted and illiquid securities the fund may invest in restricted securities restricted securities are any securities in which the fund may otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objective and policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law securities that can be traded without restrictions in nonus securities markets will not be treated as restricted even if they cannot be traded in us securities markets without restriction restricted securities may be issued by new and early stage companies which may include a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses as a result of the absence of a public trading market for these securities they may be less liquid than publicly traded securities although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions the prices realized from these sales could be less repurchase agreements the fund may invest in repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are arrangements by which the fund purchases a security for cash and obtains a simultaneous commitment from the seller usually a bank or brokerdealer to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price and specified future date the repurchase price reflects an agreedupon interest rate for the time period of the agreement the funds risk is the inability of the seller to pay the agreedupon price on the delivery date however this risk is tempered by the ability of the fund to sell the security in the open market in the case of a default in such a case the fund may incur costs in disposing of the security which would increase fund expenses the adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the firms with which the fund enters into repurchase agreements whenissued a lending of portfolio securities in order to generate additional income the fund may lend portfolio securities on a shortterm or longterm basis to brokerdealers banks or other institutional borrowers of securities the fund will only enter into loan arrangements with broker dealers banks or other institutions which the adviser has determined are creditworthy under guidelines established by the directors and will receive collateral in the form of cash or us government securities equal to at least  of the value of the securities loaned at all times temporary investments for temporary defensive purposes when the adviser determines that market conditions warrant up to  of total assets and to maintain liquidity up to  of total assets the fund may invest in us and foreign debt instruments as well as cash or cash equivalents including foreign and domestic money market instruments shortterm government the fund may also enter into foreign currency transactions to protect fund assets against adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations such changes could unfavorably affect the value of fund assets which are denominated in foreign currencies such as foreign securities or funds deposited in foreign banks as measured in us dollars although foreign currency exchanges may be used by the fund to protect against a decline in the value of one or more currencies such efforts may also limit any potential gain that might result from a relative increase in the value of such currencies and might in certain cases result in losses to the fund further the fund may be affected either unfavorably or favorably by fluctuations in the relative rates of exchange between the currencies of different nations crosshedging transactions by the fund involve the the fund may also protect against the decline of a particular foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell an amount of that currency approximating the value of all or a portion of the funds assets denominated in that currency hedging the success of this type of shortterm hedging strategy is highly uncertain due to the difficulties of predicting shortterm currency market movements and of precisely matching forward contract amounts and the constantly changing value of the securities involved although the adviser will consider the likelihood of changes in currency values when making investment decisions the adviser believes that it is important to be able to enter into forward contracts when it believes the interests of the fund will be served the fund will not enter into forward contracts for hedging purposes in a particular currency in an amount in a call option gives the purchaser the right to buy and the writer the obligation to sell the underlying currency security or other asset at the exercise price during the option period a put option gives the purchaser the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying currency security or other asset at the exercise price during the option period the writer of a covered call owns assets that are acceptable for escrow and the writer of a secured put invests an amount not less than the exercise price in eligible assets to the extent that it is obligated as a writer if a call written by the fund is exercised the fund foregoes any possible profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying asset over the exercise price plus the premium received in writing futures and options on futures the fund may enter into futures contracts involving foreign currency securities and securities indices or options thereon for bona fide hedging purposes the fund may also enter into such futures contracts or related options for purposes other than bona fide hedging if the aggregate amount of initial margin deposits exclusive of the margin needed for foreign currency hedging on the funds futures and related options positions would not exceed  of the net liquidation value of the funds assets provided further that in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation in addition the fund may not sell futures contracts if the value of such futures contracts exceeds the total market value of the funds portfolio securities futures contracts and the fund may enter into securities index futures contracts and purchase and write put and call options on securities index futures contracts that are traded on regulated exchanges including nonus exchanges to the extent permitted by the cftc securities index futures contracts are based on indexes that reflect the market value of securities of the firms included in the indexes an index futures contract is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the differences between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally written the fund may enter into securities index futures contracts to sell a securities index in anticipation of or during a market decline to attempt to offset the an option on a securities index futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a securities index futures contract the fund may purchase and write put and call options on securities index futures contracts in order to hedge all or a portion of its investment and may enter into closing purchase transactions with respect to written options in order to terminate existing positions there is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected the fund may also invest in options on securities index futures contracts when the adviser believes such investment is more efficient liquid or cost effective than investing directly in the futures contract or in the securities underlying the index or when the futures contract or underlying securities are not available for investment upon favorable terms the use of it is not certain that a secondary market for positions in futures contracts or for options will exist at all times although the adviser will consider liquidity before entering into these transactions there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange or otherwise will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any particular time the funds ability to establish and close out futures and options positions depends on this secondary market new futures contracts options thereon and other financial products and risk management techniques continue to be developed the fund may use these investments and techniques to the extent consistent with its investment objectives and regulatory and federal tax considerations risks of futures and options transactions when the fund uses futures and options on futures as hedging devices there is a risk that the prices of the securities swap agreements as one way of managing its exposure to different types of investments the fund may enter into interest rate swaps currency swaps and other types of swap agreements such as caps collars and floors depending on how they are used swap agreements may increase or decrease the overall volatility of the funds investments its share price and yield the fund may invest up to  of its assets in swap agreements that the adviser determines to be liquid swap agreements are sophisticated instruments that typically involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of risks assumed as a result swaps can be highly volatile and may have a considerable impact on the funds performance swap agreements are subject to risks related to the counterpartys ability to perform and may decline in value if the counterpartys creditworthiness deteriorates the economies of foreign countries may differ from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rate of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position further the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent on international trade and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers exchange controls managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade prior governmental approval for foreign investments may be required under certain circumstances in some countries and the extent of foreign investment in certain debt securities and domestic companies may be subject to limitation foreign ownership with respect to any foreign country there is the possibility of nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation political changes governmental regulation social instability or diplomatic developments including war which could affect adversely the economies of such countries or the value of the funds investments in those countries in addition it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in a court outside of the united states brokerage commissions custodial services and other costs relating to investment may be more expensive than in the united states foreign markets may have different clearance and settlement procedures such as requiring payment for securities before delivery in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases securities prices in emerging market countries can be significantly more volatile than in developed countries reflecting the greater uncertainties of investing in lesser developed markets and economies in particular emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments and may present the risk of nationalization of businesses expropriation confiscatory taxation or in certain instances reversion to closed market centrally planned economies such countries may also have restrictions on foreign ownership or prohibitions on the repatriation of assets and may have less protection of property rights than developed countries the economies of emerging market countries may be predominantly based on only a few industries or dependent on revenues from particular commodities or on international aid or development assistance may be highly vulnerable to changes in local or global trade conditions and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates currency risks because the majority of securities purchased by the fund are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the funds net asset value the value of interest earned gains and losses realized on the sale of securities and net investment income and capital gain if any to be distributed to shareholders by the fund if the value of a foreign currency rises against the us dollar the value of fund assets denominated in the currency will increase correspondingly if the value of a foreign currency declines against the us dollar the value of fund assets denominated in that currency will decrease under the united states internal revenue code the code the fund is required to separately account for the foreign currency component of gains or losses which will usually be viewed under less readily available market quotations on foreign companies differences in government regulation and supervision of foreign stock exchanges brokers listed companies and banks differences in legal systems which may affect the ability to enforce contractual obligations or obtain court judgments the limited size of many foreign securities markets and limited trading volume in issuers compared to the volume of trading in us securities could cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the quality of securities the likelihood that foreign securities may be less liquid or more volatile foreign brokerage commissions may be higher unreliable mail service between countries political or financial changes which adversely affect investments in some countries increased risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities certain markets may require payment for securities before delivery religious and ethnic instability and certain national policies which may restrict the funds investment opportunities including restrictions on investment in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests us government policies in the past us government policies have discouraged or restricted certain investments abroad by investors such as the fund investors are advised that when such policies are instituted the fund will abide by them diversification with respect to  of the value of total assets the fund will not invest more than  in securities of any one issuer other than cash cash items securities of investment companies or securities issued or guaranteed by the government of the united states or its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities or acquire more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer for which purposes all indebtedness of an issuer shall be deemed a single class and all preferred stock of an issuer shall be deemed a single class except that futures or option contracts and securities of mutual funds shall not be subject to this restriction this policy cannot be changed without the approval of holders of a majority of the funds shares nondiversification the underlying funds in which the fund invests may be nondiversified investment companies as such there is no investment company act of   act limit on the percentage of assets which can be invested in any single issuer an investment in such funds therefore will entail greater risks than would exist in diversified investment companies because the higher percentage of investments among fewer issuers may result in greater fluctuation in the total market value of the funds portfolio any economic political or regulatory developments affecting the value of the securities of such issuer held by the fund will have a greater impact on the total value of the funds portfolio than would be the case if the fund were diversified among more issuers however it is anticipated that the underlying funds will comply with subchapter m of the internal revenue code this requires that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year the aggregate value of all investments in any one issuer except us government obligations cash cash items and other investment companies which exceed  of a funds total assets shall not exceed  of the value of its total assets and with respect to the remaining assets no more than  of a funds assets shall be invested in a single issuer risk factors relating to investing in high yield securities the debt securities in which the fund invests are usually not in the three highest rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization aaa aa or a for sp or fitch and aaa aa or a for moodys but are in the lower rating categories or are unrated but are of comparable quality and have speculative characteristics or are speculative lowerrated bonds or unrated bonds are commonly referred to as junk bonds a description of the rating categories is contained in the appendix of this prospectus debt obligations that are not determined to be investment grade are high yield highrisk bonds typically subject to greater market fluctuations and greater risk of additional considerations of investing in other investment companies any investment in a mutual fund involves risk and although the fund invests in a number of underlying funds this practice does not eliminate investment risk under certain circumstances an underlying fund may determine to make payment of a redemption by a fund wholly or partly by a distribution in kind of securities from its portfolio in lieu of cash in conformity with the rules of the sec in such cases the fund may hold portfolio securities distributed by an underlying fund until the adviser determines that it is appropriate to dispose of such securities the fund may purchase shares of both load and noload underlying funds including those with a contingent deferred sales charge however in most cases the fund anticipates purchasing fund shares without a sales charge or qualifying for a reduction or waiver of any sales charge because of the amount it intends to invest in the underlying fund under the  act a mutual fund must sell its shares at the price including sales charge if any described in its prospectus and current rules under the  act do not permit negotiation of sales charges therefore the fund currently is not able to negotiate the level of the sales charges at which it will purchase shares of load funds nevertheless when appropriate the fund will purchase such shares pursuant to i letters of intent permitting it to obtain reduced or no sales charges by aggregating its intended purchases over time generally  months from the initial purchase under the letter ii rights of accumulation permitting it to obtain reduced or no sales charges as it purchases additional shares of an underlying fund and iii the right to obtain reduced or no sales charges by aggregating its purchases of several funds within a family of mutual funds investment limitations the fund will not oborrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements arrangements in which the fund sells a portfolio instrument for a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set date or pledge securities except under certain circumstances the fund may borrow up to onethird of the value of its total assets and pledge its assets to secure such borrowings or owith respect to  of its total assets invest more than  of the value of its total assets in securities of any one issuer other than cash cash items securities of other investment companies or securities issued or guaranteed by the us government and its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements collateralized by such securities or acquire more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer the above investment limitations cannot be portfolio turnover although the fund does not intend to invest for the purpose of seeking shortterm profits securities in the funds portfolio will be sold whenever the adviser believes it is appropriate to do so in light of the funds investment objective without regard to the length of time a particular security may have been held generally a high portfolio turnover rate results in increased transaction costs and higher taxes paid by the funds shareholders in addition a high rate of portfolio turnover may result in the realization of a larger amount of capital gains which when distributed to the funds shareholders are taxable to them transactions for the funds portfolio will be based only upon investment considerations and will not be limited by any other considerations when the funds adviser deems it appropriate to make changes in the funds portfolio there is no limit on the underlying funds portfolio turnover rates hub and spoker option if the directors determine it to be in the best interest of the fund and its shareholders the fund may in the future seek to achieve its investment objective by investing all of its assets in another investment company having the same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies and restrictions as those applicable to the fund it is expected that any such investment company would be managed in substantially the same manner as the fund the initial shareholder of the fund who is an affiliate of federated global research voted to vest authority to use this investment structure in the sole discretion of the directors no further approval of shareholders is required shareholders will receive at least  days prior notice of any such investment in making its determination the directors will consider among other things the benefits to shareholders andor the opportunity to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies although it is expected that the directors will not approve an arrangement that is likely to result in higher costs no assurance is given that costs will remain the same or be materially reduced if this investment structure is implemented net asset value the funds net asset value per share fluctuates the net asset value for shares is determined by adding the interest of each class of shares in the market value of all securities and other assets of the fund subtracting the interest of each class of shares in the liabilities of the fund and those attributable to each class of shares and dividing the remainder by the total number of each class of shares outstanding the net asset value for each class of shares may differ due to the variance in daily net income realized by each class such variance will reflect only accrued net income to which the shareholders of a particular class are entitled the net asset value of each class of shares of the fund is determined as of the close of trading normally  pm eastern time on the new york stock exchange monday through friday except on i days on which there are not sufficient changes in the value of the funds portfolio securities that its net asset value might be materially affected ii days during which no shares are

redeemed within six full years following purchase class b shares will automatically convert into class a shares based on relative net asset value on or around the fifteenth of the month eight full years after the purchase date class b shares provide an investor the benefit of putting all of the investors dollars to work from the time the investment is made but until conversion will have a higher expense ratio and pay lower dividends than class a shares due to a b fee class c shares class c shares are sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to a  contingent deferred sales charge on assets redeemed within the first  months following purchase class c shares provide an investor the benefit of putting all of the investors dollars to work from the time the investment is

discounts and accumulated purchases concurrent purchases signing a month letter of intent using the reinvestment privilege or purchases with proceeds from redemptions of unaffiliated investment companies quantity discounts and accumulated purchases as shown in the table on the previous page larger purchases may reduce the sales charge paid the fund will combine purchases of class a shares made on the same day by the investor the investors spouse and the investors children under age  when it calculates the sales charge in addition the sales charge if applicable is eliminated or reduced for purchases made at one time by a trustee or fiduciary for a single trust estate or a single fiduciary account if an additional purchase of class a shares is made the fund will consider the previous purchases still invested in the fund for example if a shareholder already owns class a shares having a current value at the public offering price of  and he purchases  more at the current public

general information about the fund the fund is a portfolio in world investment series inc the corporation which was established under the laws of the state of maryland on january   shares of the fund are offered in three classes known as class a shares class b shares and class c shares individually and collectively referred to as shares as the context may require this statement of additional information relates to all three classes of shares of the fund investment objective and policies the investment objective of the fund is to provide longterm growth of capital any income realized from the portfolio is incidental the fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in shares of other mutual funds the portfolios of which consist primarily of equity securities of nonus issuers additionally pursuant to exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission sec the fund may also invest directly in equity securities of companies domiciled outside the united states the investment objective cannot be changed without approval of shareholders types of investments the fund invests primarily in shares of other openend management investment companies for which affiliates of federated investors serve as investment adviser and principal underwriter the federated funds and herein referred to as the underlying funds that invest primarily in foreign equity securities to the extent that the funds assets are invested in underlying funds its investment experience will correspond directly with that of its proportionate investment in those funds the fund may also invest in a diversified portfolio composed of nonus securities and directly in the securities held by the underlying funds because the fund and the underlying funds will have substantially similar investment experiences and incur similar risks all further references to the fund hereinafter include the underlying funds unless otherwise indicated although many of the underlying funds have the same or similar investment policies as the fund they are not required to do so a substantial portion of these instruments will be equity securities of companies domiciled outside the united states the fund will invest in equity securities denominated in foreign currencies including european currency units of issuers located in at least three countries outside of the united states and sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts the fund may also enter into forward commitments repurchase agreements foreign currency transactions and maintain reserves in foreign or us money market instruments whenissued and delayed delivery transactions these transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for the fund no fees or other expenses other than normal transaction costs are incurred however liquid assets of the fund sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the funds records at the trade date these assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction has been settled the fund does not intend to engage in whenissued and delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than  of the total value of its assets lending of portfolio securities the collateral received when the fund lends portfolio securities must be valued daily and should the market value of the loaned securities increase the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the fund during the time portfolio securities are on loan the borrower pays the fund any dividends or interest paid on such securities loans are subject to termination at the option of the fund or the borrower the fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or equivalent collateral to the borrower or placing broker the fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan but would terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment there is the risk that when lending portfolio securities the securities may not be available to the fund on a timely basis and the fund may therefore lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price in addition in the event that a borrower of securities would file for bankruptcy or become insolvent disposition of the securities may be delayed pendng court action repurchase agreements the fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily to the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the fund the fund could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities in the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent disposition of such securities by the fund might be delayed pending court action the fund believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the funds portfolio securities subject to repurchase agreements a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the fund and allow retention or disposition of such securities the fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as brokerdealers which are found by federated global research the funds investment adviser the adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the corporations board of directors the directors the fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily in the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent disposition of such securities by the fund might be delayed pending court action the fund believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the funds portfolio securities subject to repurchase agreements a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the fund and allow retention or disposition of such securities the fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as brokerdealers which are deemed by federated global research corp the funds adviser the adviser to be creditworthy restricted and illiquid securities the ability of the directors to determine the liquidity of certain restricted securities is permitted under an sec staff position set forth in the adopting release for rule a under the securities act of  as amended the rule the rule is a nonexclusive safeharbor for certain secondary market transactions involving registration for resales of otherwise restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers the rule was expected to further enhance the liquidity of the secondary market for securities eligible for resale under the rule the fund believes that the staff of the sec has left the question of determining the liquidity of all restricted securities to the directors the directors may consider the following criteria in determining the liquidity of certain restricted securities othe frequency of trades and quotes for the security othe number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential buyers odealer undertakings to make a market in the security and othe nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades notwithstanding the foregoing securities of foreign issuers which are not listed on a recognized domestic or foreign exchange or for which a bona fide market does not exist at the time of purchase or subsequent transaction shall be treated as illiquid securities by the directors futures and options transactions the fund may engage in futures and options hedging transactions in an effort to reduce fluctuations in the net asset value of shares the fund may attempt to hedge all or a portion of its portfolio by buying and selling financial futures contracts buying put options on portfolio securities and listed put options on futures contracts and writing call options on futures contracts the fund may also write covered call options on portfolio securities to attempt to increase its current income the fund will maintain its positions in securities option rights and segregated cash subject to puts and calls until the options are exercised closed or have expired an option position on financial futures contracts may be closed out only on the exchange on which the position was established futures contracts the fund may engage in transactions in futures contracts a futures contract is a firm commitment by two parties the seller who agrees to make delivery of the specific type of security called for in the contract going short and the buyer who agrees to take delivery of the security going long at a certain time in the future however a stock index futures contract is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally written no physical delivery of the underlying securities in the index is made the purpose of the acquisition or sale of a futures contract by the fund is to protect the fund from fluctuations in the value of its securities caused by anticipated changes in interest rates or market conditions without necessarily buying or selling the securities for example in the fixed income securities market price generally moves inversely to interest rates a rise in rates generally means a drop in price conversely a drop in rates generally means a rise in price in order to hedge its holdings of fixed income securities against a rise in market interest rates the fund could enter into contracts to deliver securities at a predetermined price ie go short to protect itself against the possibility that the prices of its fixed income securities may decline during the anticipated holding period the fund would go long ie agree to purchase securities in the future at a predetermined price to hedge against a decline in market interest rates put options on futures contracts the fund may engage in transactions in put options on futures contracts the fund may purchase listed put options on futures contracts unlike entering directly into a futures contract which requires the purchaser to buy a financial instrument on a set date at a specified price the purchase of a put option on a futures contract entitles but does not obligate its purchaser to decide on or before a future date whether to assume a short position at the specified price the fund would purchase put options on futures contracts to protect portfolio securities against decreases in value resulting from market factors such as an anticipated increase in interest rates generally if the hedged portfolio securities decrease in value during the term of an option the related futures contracts will also decrease in value and the option will increase in value in such an event the fund will normally close out its option by selling an identical option if the hedge is successful the proceeds received by the fund upon the sale of the second option may be large enough to offset both the premium paid by the fund for the original option plus the decrease in value of the hedged securities alternatively the fund may exercise its put option to close out the position to do so it would simultaneously enter into a futures contract of the type underlying the option for a price less than the strike price of the option and exercise the option the fund would then deliver the futures contract in return for payment of the strike price if the fund neither closes out nor exercises an option the option will expire on the date provided in the option contract and only the premium paid for the contract will be lost when the fund sells a put on a futures contract it receives a cash premium which can be used in whatever way is deemed most advantageous to the fund in exchange for such premium the fund grants to the purchaser of the put the right to receive from the fund at the strike price a short position in such futures contract even though the strike price upon exercise of the option is greater than the value of the futures position received by such holder if the value of the underlying futures position is not such that exercise of the option would be profitable to the option holder the option will generally expire without being exercised the fund has no obligation to return premiums paid to it whether or not the option is exercised it will generally be the policy of the fund in order to avoid the exercise of an option sold by it to cancel its obligation under the option by entering into a closing purchase transaction if available unless it is determined to be in the funds interest to deliver the underlying futures position a closing purchase transaction consists of the purchase by the fund of an option having the same term as the option sold by the fund and has the effect of canceling the funds position as a seller the premium which the fund will pay in executing a closing purchase transaction may be higher than the premium received when the option was sold depending in large part upon the relative price of the underlying futures position at the time of each transaction call options on futures contracts the fund may engage in transactions in call options on futures contracts in addition to purchasing put options on futures the fund may write listed call options on futures contracts to hedge its portfolio against for example an increase in market interest rates when the fund writes a call option on a futures contract it is undertaking the obligation of assuming a short futures position selling a futures contract at the fixed strike price at any time during the life of the option if the option is exercised as market interest rates rise or as stock prices fall causing the prices of futures to go down the funds obligation under a call option on a future to sell a futures contract costs less to fulfill causing the value of the funds call option position to increase in other words as the underlying futures price goes down below the strike price the buyer of the option has no reason to exercise the call so that the fund keeps the premium received for the option this premium can help substantially to offset the drop in value of the funds portfolio securities prior to the expiration of a call written by the fund or exercise of it by the buyer the fund may close out the option by buying an identical option if the hedge is successful the cost of the second option will be less than the premium received by the fund for the initial option the net premium income of the fund will then help offset the decrease in value of the hedged securities when the fund purchases a call on a financial futures contract it receives in exchange for the payment of a cash premium the right but not the obligation to enter into the underlying futures contract at a strike price determined at the time the call was purchased regardless of the comparative market value of such futures position at the time the option is exercised the holder of a call option has the right to receive a long or buyers position in the underlying futures contract the fund will not maintain open positions in futures contracts it has sold or call options it has written on futures contracts if in the aggregate the value of the open positions marked to market exceeds the current market value of its securities portfolio including cash or cash equivalents plus or minus the unrealized gain or loss on those open positions adjusted for the correlation of volatility between the hedged securities and the futures contracts if this limitation is exceeded at any time the fund will take prompt action to close out a sufficient number of open contracts to bring its open futures and options positions within this limitation margin in futures transactions unlike the purchase or sale of a security the fund does not pay or receive money upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract rather the fund is required to deposit an amount of initial margin in cash or us treasury bills with the custodian or the broker if legally permitted the nature of initial margin in futures transactions is different from that of margin in securities transactions in that futures contracts initial margin does not involve a borrowing by the fund to finance the transactions initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract which is returned to the fund upon termination of the futures contract assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied a futures contract held by the fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of the exchange on which it is traded each day the fund pays or receives cash called variation margin equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract this process is known as marking to marketvariation margin does not represent a borrowing or loan by the fund but is instead settlement between the fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract expired in computing its daily net asset value the fund will mark to market its open futures positions the fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin when it writes call options on futures contracts regulatory restrictions to the extent required to comply with commodity futures trading commission regulation  and thereby avoid status as a commodity pool operator the fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase an option thereon if immediately thereafter the initial margin deposits for futures contracts held by it plus premiums paid by it for open options on futures would exceed  of the total assets of the fund the fund will not engage in transactions in futures contracts or options thereon for speculation but only to attempt to hedge against changes in market conditions affecting the value of assets which the fund holds or intends to purchase when futures contracts or options thereon are purchased in order to protect against a price increase on securities or other assets intended to be purchased later it is anticipated that at least  of such intended purchases will be completed when other futures contracts or options thereon are purchased the underlying value of such contracts at all times will not exceed the sum of  accrued profit on such contracts held by the broker  cash or highquality money market instruments set aside in an identifiable manner and  cash proceeds from investments due in  days or less purchasing put options on portfolio securities the fund may purchase put options on portfolio securities to protect against price movements in particular securities in its portfolio a put option gives the fund in return for a premium the right to sell the underlying security to the writer seller at a specified price during the term of the option writing covered call options on portfolio securities the fund may write covered call options to generate income as a writer of a call option the fund has the obligation upon exercise of the option during the option period to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price the fund may only sell call options either on securities held in its portfolio or on securities which it has the right to obtain without payment of further consideration or has segregated cash in the amount of any additional consideration overthecounter options the fund may purchase and write overthecounter options otc options on portfolio securities in negotiated transactions with the buyers or writers of the options for those options on portfolio securities held by the fund and not traded on an exchange otc options are twoparty contracts with price and terms negotiated between buyer and seller in contrast exchangetraded options are thirdparty contracts with standardized strike prices and expiration dates and are purchased from a clearing corporation exchangetraded options have a continuous liquid market while overthecounter options may not risks options certain hedging vehicles have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisers view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such hedging strategies could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to the fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on its investments or cause the fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in the fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of the fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of the funds position in addition futures and options markets may both be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have not markets as a result in certain markets the fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchase of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of hedging strategies would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the hedging strategies had not been utilized combined transactions the fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transaction including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single hedging strategy as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the adviser it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisers judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective swaps caps floors and collars among the hedging strategies into which the fund may enter are interest rate currency and index swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date the fund intends to use these transactions as hedges and not as speculative investments and will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rating payments of fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values the fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as these swaps caps floors and collars are entered into for good faith hedging purposes the adviser and the fund believe such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the investment company act of  as amended and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to its borrowing restrictions there is no minimal acceptable rating for a swap cap floor or collar to be purchased or held in the funds portfolio if there is a default by the counterparty the fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps risks of hedging strategies outside the us when conducted outside the us hedging strategies may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in the funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and the margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity use of segregated and other special accounts many hedging strategies in addition to other requirements require that the fund segregate liquid high grade assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid high grade securities at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by the fund will require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate liquid high grade securities sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by the fund on an index will require the fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate liquid high grade assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by the fund requires the fund to segregate liquid high grade assets equal to the exercise price except when the fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency a currency contract which obligates the fund to buy or sell currency will generally require the fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid securities denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate liquid high grade assets equal to the amount of the funds obligations otc options entered into by the fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and otc issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when the fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an otc guaranteed listed option sold by the fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when the fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the in themoney amount exceeds the exercise price the fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess otc issued and exchange listed options sold by the fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery and the fund will segregate an equal amount of assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon the fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps the fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid high grade securities having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to the funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and hedging strategies for example the fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund moreover instead of segregating assets if the fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other hedging strategies may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated the funds activities involving hedging strategies may be limited by the requirements of subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for qualification as a regulated investment company see tax status foreign currency transactions currency risks the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies are a function of such factors as supply and demand in the currency exchange markets international balances of payments governmental intervention speculation and other economic and political conditions although the fund values its assets daily in us dollars the fund may not convert its holdings of foreign currencies to us dollars daily the fund may incur conversion costs when it converts its holdings to another currency foreign exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference between the price at which the fund buys and sells currencies the fund will engage in foreign currency exchange transactions in connection with its portfolio investments the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts the fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in order to protect against a possible loss resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the us dollar and a foreign currency involved in an underlying transaction however forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit potential gains which could result from a positive change in such currency relationships the adviser believes that it is important to have the flexibility to enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts whenever it determines that it is in the funds best interest to do so the fund will not speculate in foreign currency exchange the fund will not enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts or maintain a net exposure in such contracts when it would be obligated to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of its portfolio securities or other assets denominated in that currency or in the case of a crosshedge denominated in a currency or currencies that the adviser believes will tend to be closely correlated with that currency with regard to price movements generally the fund will not enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract with a term longer than one year foreign currency options a foreign currency option provides the option buyer with the right to buy or sell a stated amount of foreign currency at the exercise price on a specified date or during the option period the owner of a call option has the right but not the obligation to buy the currency conversely the owner of a put option has the right but not the obligation to sell the currency when the option is exercised the seller ie writer of the option is obligated to fulfill the terms of the sold option however either the seller or the buyer may in the secondary market close its position during the option period at any time prior to expiration a call option on foreign currency generally rises in value if the underlying currency appreciates in value and a put option on foreign currency generally rises in value if the underlying currency depreciates in value although purchasing a foreign currency option can protect the fund against an adverse movement in the value of a foreign currency the option will not limit the movement in the value of such currency for example if the fund was holding securities denominated in a foreign currency that was appreciating and had purchased a foreign currency put to hedge against a decline in the value of the currency the fund would not have to exercise its put option likewise if the fund were to enter into a contract to purchase a security denominated in foreign currency and in conjunction with that purchase were to purchase a foreign currency call option to hedge against a rise in value of the currency and if the value of the currency instead depreciated between the date of purchase and the settlement date the fund would not have to exercise its call instead the fund could acquire in the spot market the amount of foreign currency needed for settlement special risks associated with foreign currency options buyers and sellers of foreign currency options are subject to the same risks that apply to options generally in addition there are certain risks associated with foreign currency options the markets in foreign currency options are relatively new and the funds ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary market although the fund will not purchase or write such options unless and until in the opinion of the adviser the market for them has developed sufficiently to ensure that the risks in connection with such options are not greater than the risks in connection with the underlying currency there can be no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for a particular option at any specific time in addition options on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors that influence foreign exchange rates and investments generally the value of a foreign currency option depends upon the value of the underlying currency relative to the us dollar as a result the price of the option position may vary with changes in the value of either or both currencies and may have no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security because foreign currency transactions occurring in the interbank market involve substantially larger amounts than those that may be involved in the use of foreign currency options investors may be disadvantaged by having to deal in an odd lot market generally consisting of transactions of less than  million for the underlying foreign currencies at prices that are less favorable than for round lots there is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign currencies or any regulatory requirement that quotations available through dealers or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely basis available quotation information is generally representative of very large transactions in the interbank market and thus may not reflect relatively smaller transactions ie less than  million where rates may be less favorable the interbank market in foreign currencies is a global aroundtheclock market to the extent that the us option markets are closed while the markets for the underlying currencies remain open significant price and rate movements may take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets until they reopen foreign currency futures transactions by using foreign currency futures contracts and options on such contracts the fund may be able to achieve many of the same objectives as it would through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts the fund may be able to achieve these objectives possibly more effectively and at a lower cost by using futures transactions instead of forward foreign currency exchange contracts special risks associated with foreign currency futures contracts and related options buyers and sellers of foreign currency futures contracts are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally in addition there are risks associated with foreign currency futures contracts and their use as a hedging device similar to those associated with options on currencies as described above options on foreign currency futures contracts may involve certain additional risks trading options on foreign currency futures contracts is relatively new the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary market to reduce this risk the fund will not purchase or write options on foreign currency futures contracts unless and until in the opinion of the adviser the market for such options has developed sufficiently that the risks in connection with such options are not greater than the risks in connection with transactions in the underlying foreign currency futures contracts compared to the purchase or sale of foreign currency futures contracts the purchase of call or put options on futures contracts involves less potential risk to the fund because the maximum amount at risk is the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs however there may be circumstances when the purchase of a call or put option on a futures contract would result in a loss such as when there is no movement in the price of the underlying currency or futures contract special considerations affecting emerging markets investing in equity securities of companies in emerging markets may entail greater risks than investing in equity securities in developed countries these risks include i less social political and economic stability ii the small current size of the markets for such securities and the currently low or nonexistent volume of trading which result in a lack of liquidity and in greater price volatility iii certain national policies which may restrict the funds investment opportunities including restrictions on investment in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests iv foreign taxation and v the absence of developed structures governing private or foreign investment or allowing for judicial redress for injury to private property investing in the securities of companies in emerging markets may entail special risks relating to the potential political and economic instability and the risks of expropriation nationalization confiscation or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investment convertibility of currencies into us dollars and on repatriation of capital invested in the event of such expropriation nationalization or other confiscation by any country the fund could lose its entire investment in any such country settlement mechanisms in emerging markets may be less efficient and reliable than in more developed markets in such emerging securities markets there may be share registration and delivery delays or failures most latin american countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates and corresponding currency devaluations have had any may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain latin american countries political social and economic risks even though opportunities for investment may exist in emerging markets any change in the leadership or policies of the governments of those countries or in the leadership or policies of any other government which exercises a significant influence over those countries may halt the expansion of or reverse the liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and thereby eliminate any investment opportunities which may currently exist investors should note that upon the accession to power of authoritarian regimes the governments of a number of latin american countries previously expropriated large quantities of real and personal property similar to the property which will be represented by the securities purchased by the fund the claims of property owners against those governments were never finally settled there can be no assurance that any property represented by securities purchased by the fund will not also be expropriated nationalized or otherwise confiscated if such confiscation were to occur the fund could lose its entire investment in such countries the funds investments would similarly be adversely affected by exchange control regulation in any of those countries certain countries in which the fund may invest may have groups that advocate radical religious or revolutionary philosophies or support ethnic independence any disturbance on the part of such individuals could carry the potential for widespread destruction or confiscation of property owned by individuals and entities foreign to such country and could cause the loss of the funds investment in those countries instability may also result from among other things i authoritarian governments or military involvement in political and economic decisionmaking including changes in government through extraconsititutional means ii popular unrest associated with demands for improved political economic and social conditions and iii hostile relations with neighboring or other countries such political social and economic instability could disrupt the principal financial markets in which the fund invests and adversely affect the value of the funds assets additional risk considerations the directors consider at least annually the likelihood of the imposition by any foreign government of exchange control restrictions which would affect the liquidity of the funds assets maintained with custodians in foreign countries as well as the degree of risk from political acts of foreign governments to which such assets may be exposed the directors also consider the degree of risk involved through the holding of portfolio securities in domestic and foreign securities depositories however in the absence of willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the adviser any losses resulting from the holding of the funds portfolio securities in foreign countries andor with securities depositories will be at the risk of shareholders no assurance can be given that the directors appraisal of the risks will always be correct or that such exchange control restrictions or political acts of foreign governments might not occur portfolio turnover the fund will not attempt to set or meet a portfolio turnover rate since any turnover would be incidental to transactions undertaken in an attempt to achieve the funds investment objective portfolio securities will be sold when the adviser believes it is appropriate regardless of how long those securities have been held however the underlying funds may experience much higher portfolio turnover rates resulting in higher brokerage commissions and taxable gains or losses it is estimated the rate of portfolio turnover will generally not exceed  for the period from february   date of initial public investment to november   fiscal year end the federated asia pacific growth funds portfolio turnover rate was  for the period from february   date of initial public investment to november   fiscal year end the federated emerging

willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties imposed upon it by its contract with the corporation advisory fees for its advisory services the adviser receives an annual investment advisory fee as described in the prospectus brokerage transactions the adviser may select brokers and dealers who offer brokerage and research services these services may be furnished directly to the fund or to the adviser and may include advice as to the advisability of investing in securities security analysis and reports economic studies industry studies receipt of

persons are reasonable in relationship to the value of the brokerage and research services provided although investment decisions for the fund are made independently from those of any other accounts

sales charge or imposition of a reduced sales charge pursuant to a right granted to the fund to acquire shares without payment of a sales charge or with the payment of a reduced charge then the sales

income is recorded on the exdividend date except certain dividends from foreign securities where the exdividend date may have passed such dividends are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the

traded immediately prior to the closing of the nyse certain foreign currency exchange rates may also be determined at the latest rate prior to the closing of the nyse foreign securities quoted in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at current rates occasionally events that affect these values and exchange rates may occur between the times at which they are determined and the closing of the nyse if such events materially affect the value of portfolio securities these securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the directors although the actual calculation may be done by others redeeming shares the fund redeems shares at the next computed net asset value after the fund receives the redemption request shareholder redemptions may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge redemption procedures are explained in the prospectus under how to redeem shares although the fund does not charge for telephone redemptions it reserves the right to charge a fee for the cost of wiretransferred redemptions of less than  class b shares redeemed within six years of purchase and class c shares redeemed within one year of purchase may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge the amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is based upon the amount of the administrative fee paid at the time of purchase by the distributor to the financial institutions for services rendered and the length of time the investor remains a shareholder in the fund should financial institutions elect to receive an amount less than the administrative fee that is stated in the prospectus for servicing a particular shareholder the contingent deferred sales charge andor holding period for that particular shareholder will be reduced accordingly since portfolio securities of the fund may be traded on foreign exchanges which trade on saturdays or on holidays on which the fund will not make redemptions the net asset value of each class of shares of the fund may be significantly affected on days when shareholders do not have an opportunity to redeem their shares redemption in kind although the corporation intends to redeem shares in cash it reserves the right under certain circumstances to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by a distribution of securities from the funds portfolio the corporation has elected to be governed by rule f of the investment company act of  under which the corporation is obligated to redeem shares for any one shareholder in cash only up to the lesser of  or  of a class of shares net asset value during any day period any redemption beyond this amount will also be in cash unless the directors determine that further cash payments will have a materially adverse effect on remaining shareholders in such a case the fund will pay all or a portion of the remainder of the redemption in portfolio instruments valued in the same way as the fund determines net asset value the portfolio instruments will be selected in a manner that the directors deem fair and equitable redemption in kind will be made in conformity with applicable sec rules taking such securities at the same value employed in determining net asset value and selecting the securities in a manner the directors determine to be fair and equitable redemption in kind is not as liquid as a cash redemption if redemption is made is kind shareholders receiving their securities and selling them before their maturity could receive less than the redemption value of their securities and could incur certain transaction costs elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge the amounts that a shareholder may withdraw under a systematic withdrawal program that qualify for elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge may not exceed  annually with reference initially to the value of the class b shares upon establishment of the systematic withdrawal program and then as calculated at the fiscal year end redemptions on a qualifying systematic withdrawal program can be made at a rate of  monthly  quarterly or  semiannually with reference to the applicable account valuation amount amounts that exceed the  annual limit for redemption as described may be subject to the contingent deferred sales charge to the extent that a shareholder exchanges shares for class b shares of other federated funds the time for which the exchangedfor shares are to be held will be added to the time for which exchangedfrom shares were held for purposes of satisfying the  month holding requirement however for purposes of meeting the  minimum account value requirement class b share accounts values will not be aggregated tax status the funds tax status the fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet the requirements of subchapter m of the internal revenue code as amended applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax treatment afforded to such companies to qualify for this treatment the fund must among other requirements oderive at least  of its gross income from dividends interest and gains from the sale of securities oderive less than  of its gross income from the sale of securities held less than three months oinvest in securities within certain statutory limits and odistribute to its shareholders at least  of its net income earned during the year income the fund receives from sources within various foreign countries may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source if the fund has at least  of its assets invested directly in foreign securities at the end of its taxable year it may elect to pass through the foreign tax credit to its shareholders it is expected that the fund will not have more than  of the value of its total assets at the close of its taxable year invested directly in foreign securities and therefore will not be permitted to make this election and pass through to its shareholders each shareholders respective pro rata share of foreign taxes the fund pays will therefore be netted against their share of the funds gross income the fund may invest in any nonus corporations which could be treated as passive foreign investment companies pfics this could result in adverse tax consequences upon the disposition of or the receipt of excess distributions with respect to such equity investments to the extent the fund does invest in pfics it may adopt certain tax strategies to reduce or eliminate the adverse effects of certain federal tax provisions governing pfic investments many nonus banks and insurance companies may not be treated as pfics if they satisfy certain technical requirements under the code to the extent that the fund does invest in foreign securities which are determined to be pfic securities and is required to pay a tax on such investments a credit for this tax would not be allowed to be passed through to its shareholders therefore the payment of this tax would reduce the funds economic return from its pfic shares and excess distributions received with respect to such shares are treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains an underlying fund may invest in nonus corporations which would be treated as a pfic or become a pfic under the code this could result in adverse tax consequences upon the disposition of or the receipt of excess distributions with respect to such equity investments to the extent an underlying fund does invest in pfics it may elect to treat the pfic as a qualified electing fund or marktomarket its investments in pfics annually in either case the underlying fund may be required to distribute amounts in excess of its realized income and gains to the extent that the underlying fund itself is required to pay a tax on income or gain from investment in pfics the payment of this tax would reduce the funds economic return investment income on certain foreign securities in which the fund may invest may be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes that could reduce the return on these securities tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries however may reduce or eliminate the amount of foreign taxes to which the fund would be subject shareholders tax status shareholders are subject to federal income tax on dividends and capital gains received as cash or additional shares the funds dividends and any shortterm capital gains are taxable as ordinary income capital gains shareholders will pay federal tax at capital gains rates on longterm capital gains distributed to them regardless of how long they have held the fund shares total return the average annual total return for each class of shares of the fund is the average compounded rate of return for a given period that would equate a  initial investment to the ending redeemable value of that investment the ending redeemable value is computed by multiplying the number of shares owned at the end of the period by the offering price per share at the end of the period the number of shares owned at the end of the period is based on the number of shares purchased at the beginning of the period with  less any applicable sales charge on class a shares adjusted over the period by any additional shares assuming the annual reinvestment of all dividends and distributions any applicable contingent deferred sales charge is deducted from the ending value of the investment based on the lesser of the original purchase price or the offering price of shares redeemed occasionally total return which does not reflect the effect of the sales charge may be quoted in advertising yield the yield for each class of shares is determined by dividing the net investment income per share as defined by the sec earned by the class over a thirtyday period by the maximum offering price per share of the fund on the last day of the period this value is then annualized using semiannual compounding this means that the amount of income generated during the thirtyday period is assumed to be generated each month over a twelvemonth period and is reinvested every six months the yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by the class of share because of certain adjustments required by the sec and therefore may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders to the extent that financial institutions and brokerdealers charge fees in connection with services provided in conjunction with an investment in the fund the performance will be reduced for those shareholders paying those fees performance comparisons the funds performance of each class of shares depends upon such variables as oportfolio quality oaverage portfolio maturity otype of instruments in which the portfolio is invested ochanges in interest rates on money market instruments ochanges in the funds or a class of shares expenses and ovarious other factors the funds performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings and offering price per share fluctuate daily both net earnings and offering price per share are factors in the computation of total return investors may use financial publications andor indices to obtain a more complete view of the funds performance when comparing performance investors should consider all relevant factors such as the composition of any indices used prevailing market

information dated august   relating to this prospectusproxy statement and the agreement and plan of reorganization the plan a copy of the plan is attached to this prospectusproxy statement as exhibit a the prospectus of the international value fund accompanies this prospectusproxy statement reasons for the proposed reorganization the board of directors of the corporation board has determined that a combination of the global value fund with the international value fund is the best course of action for the global value funds shareholders because after nine years of operation the global value fund has not grown to a viable size the global value funds net assets reached a calendar year end high of  million in  however as of may   the global value funds net assets had steadily declined to reach  million at the funds present size the fixed expenses of operating the fund relative to the funds net assets are too high for shares of the fund to be saleable without the advisers waiver of its investment advisory fee andor reimbursement of fund operating expenses the funds distributor federated securities corp the distributor has advised the board that it does not believe it can significantly increase sales of fund shares in the future the adviser of the fund has advised the board that it is unwilling to continue to waive its fee and reimburse the funds operating expenses the following table shows the total return performance of the global value fund based on net asset value for the past five calendar years against its performance benchmarks net sales of fund shares for each calendar year and the funds net assets at each calendar year end prior to august   the average annual returns of the global value fund should not be viewed as indicative of the future performance because the results reflect performance when the fund was operated as the world utility fund and invested primarily in securities issued by domestic and foreign companies in the utilities sector download table       global value fund      year to date at                class a shares                     msci world value index na na na na                 msci world free index na na na                  msci world telecom     na na services index               net sales of fund shares      million million million million million million               fund net assets       million million million million million million         past performance is no guarantee of future results investment return and principal will fluctuate so that an investors shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost  during the funds last fiscal year the adviser changed its benchmark index to the msci world value index from the msci world free index because it is more reflective of the funds current investment strategy  prior to august   the funds benchmark index was the msci world telecom services index and reflected the funds previous investment strategy as the table above illustrates despite the generally satisfactory performance of the global value fund relative to its performance benchmarks net sales of the funds shares and fund assets have not grown but rather declined the distributor believes that the reorganization will result in a more viable fund for global value fund shareholders as the comparative fee tables below show it is anticipated that the reorganization will result in the net expenses of the international value fund decreasing due to increased economies of scale this is primarily the result of spreading expenses across a larger pool of assets allowing shareholders to benefit from economies of scale in the form of lower fees and expenses the distributor believes that this decrease in the international value funds expenses will increase the salability of the fund the board has voted to recommend the approval of the plan pursuant to which international value fund a portfolio of the corporation would acquire all of the assets of the global value fund also a portfolio of corporation in exchange for class a b and c shares of international value fund the exchange immediately following the exchange global value fund will distribute the class a b and c shares of international value fund to holders of class a b and c shares of global value fund respectively the distribution the exchange and the distribution are collectively referred to in this prospectusproxy statement as the reorganization as a result of the reorganization each holder of class a b and c shares of global value fund will become the owner of class a b and c shares of international value fund having a total net asset value equal to the total net asset value of his or her holdings of class a b and c shares in global value fund on the closing date as hereinafter defined in considering the proposed reorganization the board took into consideration a number of factors including  the compatibility of the international value funds and the global value funds policies and limitations  the greater longterm viability of the international value fund that could result in economics of scale through the spreading of operating costs over a larger asset base  the reorganization provides for continuity of distribution and shareholder servicing arrangements and  the reorganization will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes either to the international value fund or the global value fund or to shareholders of the global value fund the board concluded to recommend that the shareholders of the global value fund vote to approve the reorganization pursuant to rule a under the investment company act of   act the board including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons determined that participation in the transaction was in the best interests of the global value funds shareholders and that the interests of existing global value fund shareholders would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction the board likewise approved the reorganization on behalf of the international value fund pursuant to rule a under the  act the board including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons determined that participation in the transaction was in the best interests of the international value funds shareholders and that the interests of existing international value fund shareholders would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction as a condition to the reorganization each fund will receive an opinion of counsel that the reorganization will be considered a taxfree reorganization under applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended so that no gain or loss will be recognized by either fund or the global value funds shareholders the tax basis of the shares of the international value fund received by global value fund shareholders will be the same as the tax basis of their shares in the global value fund purchase redemption and exchange procedures dividends and distributions procedures for the purchase redemption and exchange of class a b and c shares of the international value fund are identical to procedures applicable to the purchase and redemption of class a b and c shares of the global value fund the dividend and distribution policies of the funds are also identical for a complete description refer to the accompanying prospectus of the international value fund any questions may be directed to the international value fund at  comparison of investment objectives and policies investment objective the investment objective of the global value fund is to provide total return total return generally consists of two components  changes in the market value of its portfolio securities both realized and unrealized appreciation and  income received from its portfolio securities the investment objective of the international value fund is to provide longterm growth of capital investment exposure provided by each fund the global value fund invests primarily in a portfolio of domestic and foreign equity securities that the funds adviser believes will appreciate in value provide income or both the international value fund invests primarily in a portfolio of securities of foreign equity securities that the funds adviser has deemed undervalued both funds are permitted to invest in the developed and emerging market countries however in each fund the adviser expects that normally foreign stocks in the funds portfolio will primarily be in developed markets both funds may purchase shares of exchangetraded funds etfs the shares of etfs are listed and traded on stock exchanges at market prices as of may   the international value fund and global value fund held  securities in common representing  of international value funds portfolio and  of global value funds portfolio therefore after the reorganization global value fund shareholders will continue to gain exposure to a global portfolio of securities that the adviser has deemed to be undervalued though it is anticipated that they will have greater exposure to foreign markets than the global value fund as of may   the international value fund has approximately  which includes a  cash position of its assets invested in domestic companies while the global value fund had approximately  which includes a  cash position role of active management both the global value fund and the international value fund are actively managed this means that the advisers goal is for its stock selection skill to drive each funds performance the adviser actively manages the global value fund seeking total returns over longer time periods in excess of a benchmark index the msci world value index the adviser also actively manages the international value fund seeking total returns in excess of the mscieafe value index currently the international value fund and the global value fund share a common portfolio manager marc halperin advisers stock selection process the advisers stock selection process for both funds is value oriented the advisers process for selecting investments begins with the screening of the universe of available stocks to identify companies with those value characteristics which the adviser believes correlate to longterm return these characteristics include for example relatively low pricebook value or priceearnings ratios and relatively high dividend yields screening is performed by market so that value is relative to each individual market after screening the adviser emphasizes fundamental analysis of companies by skilled portfolio managers bottomup stock selection instead of attempting to predict the impact of economic and market cycles topdown because it believes this approach provides a greater opportunity for the advisers expertise experience and skill to create excess returns fundamental analysis involves researching a companys financial statements management and industry leadership in an attempt to appraise a companys prospects the adviser also considers the economic environment and outlook for making stock selection decisions but those factors play a secondary role to bottomup analysis the adviser seeks to purchase undervalued stocks that the adviser expects may significantly increase in price as the market recognizes the companys true value the advisers key buy criteria for a value stock includes relatively low market price quality of company management industry leadership and presence of a catalyst for higher market valuation realization of income is a secondary consideration in the advisers stock selection for the global value fund a companys stock may be undervalued due to factors such as temporary earnings declines investor indifference a change in management or unfavorable market or industry conditions the adviser selects the stock based on its belief that over time the price at which the stock trades will rise to reflect the companys true value the adviser is free to seek relative value opportunities among markets and sectors risk management in both the global value fund and the international value fund the adviser manages the portfolios exposure to random or unpredictable events that may adversely affect individual companies or the risk that the adviser is otherwise wrong in its analysis of any particular company through portfolio diversification there is no assurance these strategies will be successful in reducing portfolio risk investment constraints neither the global value fund nor the international value fund is limited in the portion of its assets that it invests in foreign companies based in either developed markets or in emerging markets further neither fund is limited in the portion of its investments that are denominated in either foreign currency or in us dollars the global value fund contains a fundamental investment policy that permits it to concentrate in the utilities industry and the international value fund contains a fundamental investment policy that permits it to concentrate in the financial services industry however both funds have no present intention of concentrating their investments in an industry both funds may hedge a portion of their currency risk by using derivatives such as futures or forward contracts currency hedges can protect against price movements in a security that a fund owns that are attributable to changes in the value of the currency in which the security is denominated hedging may reduce gains or cause losses to the fund if the hedged currency moves in a different manner than the adviser anticipated or if the cost of the hedge outweighs its value the majority of both funds portfolios have not been hedged and have therefore been subject to currency risk and it is anticipated that this will remain the case for the international value fund comparison of risks the risks associated with the international value fund and the global value fund are similar both funds are subject to the risk of general stock market volatility investing in foreign securities foreign currency risks exchangetraded funds risk liquidity risks and risks related to investing for value however the international value fund is more susceptible to the risks of investing in foreign securities and currency risks because its portfolio is normally comprised of a higher percentage of foreign securities than the global value fund at may   the international value fund had approximately  of its assets invested in foreign securities compared to the global value fund which had approximately  of its assets invested in foreign securities comparative fee tables set forth in the following tables is information regarding the

shares information about the reorganization the funds have similar investment objectives the international value funds investment objective is to provide long term growth of capital the global value funds investment objective is to provide a total return on assets total return generally consists of  changes in the market value of its portfolio securities both realized and unrealized appreciation and  income received from its portfolio securities both funds pursue their respective investment objectives by investing in securities of foreign and domestic companies that the adviser deems to be undervalued the fundamental investment limitations of the international value fund and the global value fund are similar the international value fund contains a fundamental investment policy that permits it to concentrate in financial services industries and the global value fund contains a fundamental policy that permits it to concentrate in the utilities industry however both funds have no present intention of concentrating their investments in an industry for a more in depth comparison of investment objectives policies and limitations see comparison of investment objectives and policies the global value fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in domestic securities than the international value fund as of may   the international value fund has approximately  which includes a  cash position of its assets invested in domestic companies while the global value fund had approximately  which includes a  cash position therefore after the reorganization global value fund shareholders will continue to gain exposure to a global portfolio of securities that the adviser has deemed to be undervalued though it is anticipated that they will have greater exposure to foreign markets and less exposure to domestic markets than the global value fund description of the plan of reorganization the plan provides that on or about the closing date presently expected to be on or about october   the international value fund will acquire all of the assets of the global value fund in exchange for class a b and c shares of the international value fund to be distributed pro

the extent necessary to enable the reorganization to qualify as a taxfree transfer prior to the reorganization due to nonconformance of those securities with the investment objectives policies or

forward losses the reorganization may also require the international value fund to sell acquired portfolio securities in order to rebalance its portfolio however it is anticipated that at least a portion of any gain realized by the disposition of portfolio securities will be offset by carry forward losses to the extent allowed by the code received from the global value fund in the

additional inquiries from regulatory authorities on these and related matters and more such inquiries may be received in the future as a result of these inquiries federated and the federated funds have conducted an internal investigation of the matters raised which revealed instances in which a few investors were granted exceptions to federateds internal procedures for limiting frequent transactions and that one of these investors made an additional investment in another federated fund the investigation has also identified inadequate procedures which permitted a limited number of investors including several employees to engage in undetected frequent trading activities andor the placement and acceptance of orders to purchase shares of fluctuating net asset value funds after the funds closing times federated has issued a series of press releases describing these matters in greater detail and emphasizing that it is committed to compensating the federated funds for any detrimental impact these transactions may have had on them in that regard on february   federated and the independent directors of the federated funds announced the establishment by federated of a

with certain institutional traders which allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders federated and various federated funds have also been named as defendants in several additional lawsuits the majority of which are now pending in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging among other things excessive advisory and rule b fees

federated and the federated funds and their respective counsel are reviewing the allegations and will respond appropriately additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future the potential impact of these recent lawsuits and future potential similar suits is uncertain although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the funds

reorganization the plan a copy of the plan is attached to this prospectusproxy statement as exhibit a the prospectus of the international capital appreciation fund accompanies this prospectusproxy statement reasons for the proposed reorganization the board of directors of the corporation board has determined that a combination of the european equity fund with the international capital appreciation fund is the best course of action for the european equity funds shareholders because after eight years of operation the european equity fund has not grown to a viable size the european equity funds net assets reached a calendar year end high in  of  million however as of may   the european equity funds net assets had steadily declined to reach  million at the funds present size the fixed expenses of operating the fund relative to the funds net assets are too high for shares of the fund to be saleable without the advisers waiver of its investment advisory fee andor reimbursement of fund operating expenses the funds distributor federated securities corp the distributor has advised the board that it does not believe it can significantly increase sales of fund shares in the future the adviser of the fund has advised the board that is unwilling to continue to waive its fee and reimburse the funds operating expenses the following table shows net sales of the european equity fund shares for the past five calendar years and the funds net assets for the past five calendar years enlargedownload table        european equity fund      year to date at                net sales of fund shares        million million million million million million               fund net assets       million million million million million million        by contrast the following table shows net sales of the international capital appreciation fund shares for the past five calendar years and the funds net assets for the past five calendar years        international capital      year to appreciation fund date at                net sales of fund shares       million million million million million million               fund net assets       million million million million million million        as the tables show the distributor has been able to increase the net assets of the international capital appreciation fund but has been unable to do so with regard to the european equity fund the distributor has advised the board that it believes it can continue to increase the sales of shares of the international capital appreciation fund both the european equity fund and the international capital appreciation fund are managed by the adviser and invest directly in foreign equity securities both funds invest in companies located in international markets however the european equity fund primarily focuses on investing in european companies both funds pursue their investment objectives by using a blend of growth and value investment styles although from january   to march   the european equity fund used primarily a growth investment style and was named the federated european growth fund in the growth style the funds adviser seeks to purchase stocks of companies that it expects will rapidly increase earnings or cash flows in the future in the value style the adviser seeks to purchase undervalued stocks that may significantly increase in price as the market recognizes the companys true value the primary difference between the two funds is that the international capital appreciation fund has a broader mandate to invest in other regions of the world such as asia and in emerging markets in addition to the european region the adviser of each fund shares the same analytical trading and other resources and is subject to the same investment process disciplines within the federated organization shareholders of the european equity fund will continue to receive exposure to european companies after the reorganization as of may   the european equity fund has approximately  of its assets invested in companies located in the european region while the international capital appreciation fund had approximately  as shown below in the comparative fee tables an additional benefit to european equity fund shareholders will be the significant reduction in expenses as a result of the reorganization while the international capital appreciation fund has a higher management fee than the european equity fund overall expenses charged to european equity fund shareholders are expected to decrease as a result of the reorganization this is primarily the result of spreading expenses across a larger pool of assets allowing shareholders to benefit from economies of scale in the form of lower fees and expenses the following table shows the funds average annual total returns based on net asset value relative to each funds respective benchmark for the periods ended may   the average annual returns of the international capital appreciation fund for the period june   to august   was not necessarily consistent with its subsequent performance because the results reflect the performance of the international capital appreciation fund when it was named the

recommend the approval of the plan pursuant to which international capital appreciation fund a portfolio of the corporation would acquire all of the assets of european equity fund also a portfolio of the corporation in exchange for class a b and c shares of international capital appreciation fund the exchange immediately following the exchange european equity fund will distribute the class a b and c shares of international capital appreciation fund to holders of class a b and c shares of european equity fund respectively the distribution the exchange and the distribution are collectively referred to in this prospectusproxy statement as the reorganization as a result of the reorganization each holder of class a b and c shares of european equity fund will become the owner of class a b and c shares of international capital appreciation fund having a total net asset value equal to the total net asset value of his or her holdings of class a b and c shares in european equity fund on the closing date as hereinafter defined in considering the proposed reorganization the board took into consideration a number of factors including  the compatibility of the international capital appreciation funds and the european equity funds investment objectives policies and limitations  the greater potential longterm viability of the international capital appreciation fund  the fact that the reorganization provides for continuity of distribution and shareholder servicing arrangements and  that the proposed reorganization will result in lower fees for the european equity fund shareholders as a result of economies of scale achieved by the spreading of operating costs over a larger asset base the board concluded to recommend that the shareholders of the european equity fund vote to approve the reorganization pursuant to rule a under the investment company act of   act the board including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons determined that participation in the transaction was in the best interests of the european equity funds shareholders and that the interests of existing european equity fund shareholders would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction the board likewise approved the reorganization on behalf of the international capital appreciation fund pursuant to rule a under the  act the board including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons determined that participation in the transaction was in the best interests of the international capital appreciation funds shareholders and that the interests of existing international capital appreciation fund shareholders would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction as a condition to the reorganization each fund will receive an opinion of counsel that the reorganization will be considered a taxfree reorganization under applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended so that no gain or loss will be recognized by either fund or the european equity funds shareholders the tax basis of the shares of the international capital appreciation fund received by european equity fund shareholders will be the same as the tax basis of their shares in the european equity fund purchase redemption and exchange procedures dividends and distributions procedures for the purchase redemption and exchange of class a b and c shares of the international capital appreciation fund are identical to procedures applicable to the purchase and redemption of class a b and c shares of the european equity fund the dividend and distribution policies of the funds are also identical for a complete description refer to the accompanying prospectus of the international capital appreciation fund any questions may be directed to the international capital appreciation fund at  comparison of investment objectives and policies investment objective the european equity fund and the international capital appreciation fund share the same investment objective which is to provide longterm growth of capital investment exposure provided by each fund both funds invest primarily in securities of foreign companies however the international capital appreciation fund primarily invests in both the developed and emerging market countries throughout the world while the european equity fund primarily invests in securities issued by european companies normally the european equity funds portfolio consists primarily of equity securities of the larger and more developed countries within europe such as the united kingdom france italy and germany however the european equity fund can emphasize investment in a particular country within europe including emerging markets from time to time when conditions in a country or particular opportunities are attractive to the adviser role of active management both the european equity fund and the international capital appreciation fund are actively managed this means that the advisers goal is for its stock selection skill to drive each funds performance the adviser actively manages the european equity fund seeking total returns in excess of a benchmark index the mscieurope the adviser also actively manages the international capital appreciation fund seeking total returns in excess of the msci all country world index free ex us advisers stock selection process the advisers process for selecting investments combines different analytical and valuation techniques according to investment style in the growth style the adviser seeks to purchase stocks of companies that it expects will rapidly increase earnings or cash flows in the future the adviser selects growth stocks through fundamental research and analysis of companies bottomup research while the adviser also considers the potential impact of economic and market cycles topdown in various markets bottomup research is the primary driver of stock selection because the adviser believes this approach provides a greater opportunity for its expertise experience and skill to create excess returns the advisers key buy criteria for a growth stock include quality of company management industry leadership high growth in sales and earnings and reasonable valuation in the value style the adviser seeks to purchase undervalued stocks that the adviser expects may significantly increase in price as the market recognizes the companys true value the adviser identifies value stocks by first screening the universe of available stocks to identify those companies with relatively low pricebook value or priceearnings ratios as well as other indicators of relative value such as dividend yield after identifying investment candidates the adviser performs fundamental research and analysis to select stocks the advisers key buy criteria for a value stock include relatively low market price quality of company management industry leadership and presence of a catalyst for higher market valuation the adviser employs a team approach to fundamental analysis the adviser continuously seeks to identify the countries sectors and industries where fundamental analysis is most effective at forecasting returns and then to develop expertise in those areas analysts and portfolio managers specialize in different sectors and industries and then support each other in stock selection based on this analytical support the portfolio manager then independently makes stock selection decisions by blending growth and value styles the adviser seeks to provide capital appreciation with lower overall portfolio volatility than a portfolio of only growth stocks the adviser attempts to manage the risk of relative underperformance of the stocks of growth companies in down markets by seeking to purchase growth stocks at reasonable prices while the adviser does not take concentrated positions in individual stocks the adviser may emphasize business sectors or certain countries in the funds portfolio because they exhibit stronger growth potential or the adviser believes it has greater skill or fundamental analysis is more effective in picking stocks in those sectors or countries risk management in both the european equity fund and the international capital appreciation fund the adviser manages the portfolios exposure to random or unpredictable events that may adversely affect individual companies or the risk that the adviser is otherwise wrong in its analysis of any particular company through portfolio diversification in both funds the adviser attempts to manage the relative risk of underperformance of the stocks of growth companies in down markets by seeking to purchase growth stocks at reasonable prices investment constraints neither the european equity fund nor the international capital appreciation fund is limited in the portion of its assets that it invests in foreign companies based in either developed markets or in emerging markets further neither fund is limited in the portion of its investments that are denominated in either foreign currency or in us dollars both funds may hedge a portion of their currency risk by using derivatives such as futures or forward contracts currency hedges can protect against price movements in a security that a fund owns that are attributable to changes in the value of the currency in which the security is denominated hedging may reduce gains or cause losses to the fund if the hedged currency moves in a different manner than the adviser anticipated or if the cost of the hedge outweighs its value the majority of both funds portfolios have not been hedged and have therefore been subject to currency risk and it anticipated that this will remain the case for the international capital appreciation fund comparison of risks both funds are subject to the risk of general stock market volatility investing in foreign securities and foreign currency risks the international capital appreciation fund however is subject to emerging market risk and small company risks to a greater extent than the european equity fund while the european equity fund is subject to a greater degree to european monetary union risks than the international capital appreciation fund comparative fee tables set forth in the following tables is information regarding the fees and expenses incurred by the class a b and c

securities dealers since that time federated has received additional inquiries from regulatory authorities on these and related matters and more such inquiries may be received in the future as a result of these inquiries federated and the funds have conducted an internal investigation of the matters raised which revealed instances in which a few investors were granted exceptions to federateds internal procedures for limiting frequent transactions and that one of these investors made an additional investment in another federated fund the investigation has also identified inadequate procedures which permitted a limited number of investors including several employees to engage in undetected frequent trading activities andor the placement and acceptance of orders to purchase shares of fluctuating net asset value funds after the funds closing times federated has issued a series of press releases describing these matters in greater detail and emphasizing that it is committed to compensating the funds for any detrimental impact these transactions may have had on them in that regard on february   federated and the independent directors of the funds announced the establishment by federated of a restoration fund that is intended to cover any such detrimental impact the press releases and related communications are available in the about us section of federateds website

future potential similar suits is uncertain although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the funds there can be no assurance that these suits the ongoing adverse publicity andor other developments resulting from the regulatory investigations will not result in increased fund redemptions reduced sales of fund shares or other adverse consequences for the
