delusionalcrazy oh it was but despite her calculated lies and theories that were a complete deviation from any recognition of sanity deborah dolen deliberately and intentionally targeted my family and fabricated the entire lawsuit charade in what was just another one of her attempted scams apparently thinking that she could publicly vilify and bully us with frivolous claims until we agreed to pay her to go away this time however her plans of an easy money heist didnt turn out quite as she had expected jump to the federal courts final rulings and dismissal of dolens nonsensical claims against us jump to the federal courts final judgment in favor of the defendants and against deborah dolen there had been absolutely no provocation no reason and no prior knowledge of who this woman was in fact wed never heard of this individual who called herself deborah r dolen aka mabel white before she barged straight into our lives with her concocted and irrational claims in a vexatious pro se diy lawsuit scam it didnt take long however after finding out that wed been targeted in her scam to realize that we were dealing with someone who was not only completely out of touch with reality and not in her right mind but someone who was selfish cruel calculating unprincipled and malicious as well not to mention that she was someone who was desperately seeking attention i dont know if she is at risk for delusions or just evil but it was more than a little concerning that this person had latched on to us with her hysterical claims and threats of a federal lawsuit with minimal research we found that deborah dolen was a seasoned scammer and convicted felon  and she was now apparently intent on targeting my family in a new scam involving a pro se representing herself federal lawsuit in order to set up as she boastfully named it her retirement fund her problem even though she threatened and tried her best to smear our reputations in her calculated plan to attempt to extort money from us through litigation for a bogus lawsuit because we knew she could never back up any of her false claims or complaints and there would eventually be a time of put up or shut up we stood our ground and stood up to her her threats her bullying and her attempted lawsuit scam and we now hold a judgment against her for her vexatious behavior as defined by the federal court more details on what happened deborah r dolen made claims that she was a victim of cyber bullying she also claimed she was a victim of stalking and that she had become a new advocate against it she promoted many false nonsensical victimization claims loss of income claims claims of dental and health deterioration allegedly due to us and even her inability to fit in socially  but every calculated claim was a complete pretense and conjured up as a part of her plan to scam scheme and game the legal system pro se while disparaging libeling and labeling us as her defendants and her tormentors why simply because we had become her latest scamming endeavor in which she was trying to force us into to paying her to go away needing a platform for her rhetoric being willing to consume the leniency of the court and wellknowing that no actual attorney would ever involve themselves with this sort of frivolous and irresponsible behavior on a borrowed dime dolen simply marched into court and filed her nonsensical complaint as pro se she then openly held it over our heads that she would ruin our reputations with her lies as she continued with her pro se lawsuit against us if we did not pay her to go away in the end deborah dolen obviously could not and did not according to the federal judge provide a scintilla of proof or evidence to substantiate any of her outrageous claims the only evidence this lying scammer provided was that it was her own conduct that fell under the definition of being a stalker and a bully  and in reality just like a textbook case of false victimization everything she falsely claimed we were doing to her was exactly what she was doing to us heres the ugly truth about her attempted strongarming game via a pro se lawsuit her fictional claims her delusions her lies and her motive january  in late  on a topix forum where deborah dolen had been boasting and self proclaiming herself to be a famous author forum participants googled her name and discovered her criminal history they then ousted her on that forum as being a former prostitute and convicted felon they posted links to newspaper articles written about her and from there things apparently got ugly because dolen began denying her documented history one of these posters arden had an ip location as being in the same very large city where my family and i live at some point in time deborah dolen and my husbands disturbed ex  angela schubart ledcke now married to david a niehoff now married to brian d bohrer of carmel indiana had made contact and became friends this was most likely because they had both been listed on a website that featured scammers the revengeseeking ex convinced lawsuiteager dolen that my mother my husband and i were the topix posters and she provided dolen with our names and personal information she baited and manipulated dolen into doing her dirty work of revenge by portraying to deborah dolen that we had lots of money prior to anyone in my family even knowing that deborah dolen existed but after dolen had briefly researched stalked us and our assets as she has admitted doing she and ledcke devised a plan to have my husband and me named in a bogus lawsuitsimply to try and harass us and to force us into a monetary settlement for an added act of malice angela ledcke  niehoff bohrer also provided dolen with my elderly mothers name and convinced her to include my elderly mother in the  lawsuit according to later statements made by angela schubart ledcke  niehoff bohrer my husbands ex and dolens partner in this endeavor dolen promised ledcke that she would get them us for her the ex had lost custody of a   year old daughter to my husband a few years prior and was even denied any visitation which clearly speaks for itself she had been obsessed with trying to get even with us and constantly attempted to interject herself into our lives for the purpose of causing problems this lawsuit endeavor mustve seemed perfect for her ultimate revenge to try and tarnish our names as well as punish us financially after all neither of these women had anything including their reputations and they had nothing to lose wonder what was going on  okay ill tell you in a little more detail in this time of a downturned economy many businesses are suffering sales are down people arent spending like they had been and small businesses are taking a hitespecially homebased businesses i would imagine one homebased business owner was attempting a new way to supplement her income it seems she decided to sue unsuspecting people and play a pro se lawsuit lottery game within our legal system to most this type of lawsuit abuse would not be an option to one individual who had vast experience in the court because of her own experiences and felony record the plan was to pick our pockets through the federal court by gaming the system and filing an unfounded pro se lawsuit while simultaneously filing for bankruptcy and naming us as creditors  when convicted felon  paralegal  pro se plaintiff deborah r dolen called my then  yearold mother on the phone in mid january of  she introduced herself and began to explain to my mother how people were picking on her in some online forum and calling her ugly names she went on to say how she was a famous author mabel white and how she didnt deserve to be treat in that manner my mother had no clue who this woman was or what she was talking about so when dolen began to ask my mother personal questions my mother told her that she did not know who she was and that she was not interested at this point deborah dolen began a verbal assault and rampage and she threatened my  year old mother by telling her that she had better be interested because she was going to be sued in federal court lose everything she owned and be thrown out in the streets soon thereafter deborah r dolen aka mabel white did file her patently false and baseless lawsuit against my mother my husband and me pro se in federal court her complaint and federal lawsuit was nothing more than an narration deficient of any support that was based solely on her own delusions in fact despite the fact that my mother had no internet access computer means or ability to access the internet this bogus and fantasy lawsuit named my elderly mother as a jane doe cyberstalker and accused her of cyberstalking internet fraud conspiracy and even trademark infringement for shock value and leverage for what would become a threeyear continued attempt at extorting money from us deborah dolen was also demanding a five year prison sentence for all of us  including my elderly mother being pro se dolen obviously did not know that she couldnt make criminal claims against us in this game of lawsuit lottery dolen named all of us as known cyberstalkers and was demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages  falsely identifying us as the posters on topix and making all sort of bizarre and irrational claims against us her actions her claims and her theories  and even trying to identify us as these online posters were so ridiculously insane that they defied any boundaries of sanity any although none of us had never heard of deborah dolen or her author alias of mabel white prior to being targeted and harassed and although plaintiff  debtor deborah r dolen admitted that she has had no prior business or other dealings with any of us obviously thinking she was being cunning after filing a nonsensical pro se lawsuit against us where she was demanding close to a million dollars in damages and prior to having us served dolen filed for bankruptcy writing off close to a million dollars in unsecured bad debt and listed each of us individually as creditors for the amount of  each then after she filed for bankruptcy she served us with the federal complaint why  because as she boasted she thought she could sue us and we would be unable to file an answer or countersue her for her devious actions against us because she would be under the protection of the bankruptcy court stay if we the defendants didnt answer the lawsuit because of being named creditors the plaintiff could potentially receive a default judgment if we the defendants did answer the federal complaint her attempted intent was to slap sanctions on us in bankruptcy court for violating the bankruptcy stay of protection against creditors  even though were we not creditors at that time two courts  same game and a lot of fraud after filing her federal lawsuit her first demand for money was immediate and she said that if we paid her  she would drop the lawsuit against us we refused at one point dolen tried to bargain with us and said she would not file for sanctions against us if we were to pay her a few thousand dollars she actually made many demands of monetary solutions for dismissing us from her bogus lawsuit her monetary demands ranged from  each to  and ended up escalating to claimed damages of a whopping  dolen in her own  bankruptcy affidavit swore under penalty of perjury in bankruptcy court that she only made on the average in the three consecutive years prior to this latest bankruptcy  annually in income from her claimed fame this filing also reflected that her annual income actually increased from  to  and yet at the same time she was swearing under penalty of perjury in her complaint against us in federal court that we caused her over  in lost income from the past year that amount of a  loss is the ticket to be able to file a complaint in federal court a bold lie from dolen absolutely she banks on the courts right hand never knowing what the left hand is doing and surprisingly is doesnt she was confident that she could exploit the flaws in our system and she did we answered with counterclaims and dolen immediately threatened to have us sanctioned claiming that she was under the protection of her chapter  bankruptcy and because of that we were not allowed to answer not answering however would have guaranteed her a default judgment against us that was just one of her orchestrated games with the court eventually the bankruptcy judge informed her that from the date she filed her bankruptcy she was not protected from her actions against us but would be liable for those actions after reading the case he further cautioned her against proceeding with her claims against us and clearly stated that the purpose of his court was not to protect her from her actions or the liability resulting from them what did debtor dolen hear him say well somehow she interpreted and boasted in many delusional statements and additional filings that she won we lost and that the judge had barred our counterclaims go figure deborah dolen went on to make her claims against us public she posted false and libelous commentary about us on websites in forums and selfpublished press releases she named us individually as known cyberstalkers and claimed we wanted to obtain notoriety and some sort of power by associating ourselves with her as a selfproclaimed maverick she fabricated claims that we had stalked her and that we had other victims as well she fabricated allegations and accusations that we had committed all sorts of internet fraud trademark infringement criminal acts against her  and more at one point she even published online a selfwritten fake court order against us so that the public would conclude that her stories were real  there was even one incident where deborah dolen in typical bully modusoperandi emailed harassingly to threaten and attempt to scaretactic us by claiming that the police would be knocking down our doors at  am in a raid in order to collect our computers as evidence it seemed that whatever had happen to her in her miscreant past she wished upon us and was convinced it was going to happen including jail time every claim every allegation and in fact the entire federal lawsuit was a wild display of reckless irresponsibility grandiose and persecutory delusions intentional lies and a vexatious attempt to libel and disparage us whereby she could then demand money from us to stop so why did deborah dolen target us for her lawsuit from what i learned about and read from this plaintiff since january of  i think this came about because of some sort of grandiosehero complex she may have according to my husbands ex angela schubart ledcke as mentioned previously dolen had contacted and befriended her because they were both featured on the same online scammer site ledcke dangled my family like a carrot in front of someone who was greedy enough to forget logic and reasoning and set her sights on rolling the dice and playing a game of pro se lawsuit lottery there was no other way on earth for deborah dolen to know who we were know our names our emails andor our personal information without the rants of her new friend and my husbands longtime bothersome ex angela schubart ledcke  niehoff bohrer although ledcke eventually confessed to supplying this pro se plaintiff with our names dolens original claim was that our attorney had dimed us out and that he supplied her with our names and information the only little logistical problem with that was that dolen and ledcke were trashing us on an that topix forum days prior to us knowing anything about dolen and even before our we had contact him as our attorney at that time he had never heard of us deborah dolens bullying wasnt exclusive to us she threatened our attorney with a bar complaint if he did not do what she demanded she took it to the next level and actually filed a delusion and fantasyfilled texas bar complaint against him stating under oath that he was the one who initiated her claims against us by prodding her to sue us her next step was to post her testimony and this bar complaint on the same website as the fake court order against us and then trashtalk lie about and libel our attorney continuously in public forums  eventually to the point to where our attorney was forced to file his own complaint against deborah dolen for torts injury assault libel and slander  more about this pro se plaintiff although it has been defined as stalking by this deluded plaintiff i discovered while trying to figure out just who this derangedacting nut was who had targeted and was suing harassing threatening and disparaging my family that deborah r dolen aka deborah ruth harvey deborah r graves deborah r avramidis deborah ruth avamidis has an extensive arrest criminal and felony record  according to her fdle report and court records in various florida counties alone this woman has been arrested for everything from prostitution procurement solicitation of arson pandering forgery credit card factoring probation violation rico violations money laundering racketeering and grand theft and much more deborah dolen was one of several defendants in a consumer fraud action filed by the federal trade commission and the ftc named her as one of the top  dot con scams  more info as deborah harvey she was once even captured as a fugitive tried and convicted of racketeering in a childrens spina bifida charity scam and sentenced to a seven year prison term it appears that while in prison this pro se plaintiff obtained a paralegal certificate via correspondence classes and this may be where her illusions of being an actual attorney began  i think this may also be where she learned and practiced the language she uses to attempt to intimidate others with her threats and legalbullytalk which i personally refer to as monkeymouthcellgangster talk  this pro se litigant as deborah r harvey had once been previously determined incompetent to represent herself pro se in florida court during an appeals trial after being found guilty of felony charges in one instance i discovered that she had tried this bullying im going to sue you tactic before by claiming she had the exclusive trademark for the term soy wax in that instance she went so far as to pretend in a letter to be legal counsel as d r dolen for mabel white and another inexistent partner aka alias in order to threaten and intimidate candle makers she claimed she would haul violators  into federal court in tampa if they used the term soywax but she offered to sell them permission to use the term now that in my opinion is just not normal anyway being a convicted felon no wonder she changed her name to mabel white  sounds pure and clean doesnt it  it seems that even mabel white could not live up to honest standards and although dolen claims the name to be good mabel white home living has received numerous complaints over the years through the better business bureau and has been the subject of several online scammer sites reports and consumer forums and the defendant in at least one small claims lawsuit from fed ex these complaints and concerns date back throughout the past half a dozen years but dolen has now claimed that even the complaints that are from  through  for mabel white home living mwhl have come from me and my familyregardless of the basic fact that we would have had no motive had no prior business dealings with her and didnt even know or care that she existed until january of  when she began to harass us dolen as mabel white has even posted rebuttals to many of these aged complaints against her business of mabel white home living and although they are years old she has publicly named and accused my husband my yearold mother who doesnt own or know how to use a computer and me for submitting them  on the site ripoffreportcom only moments after she emailed our attorney stating that whatever is posted on that site never comes down as a rebuttal to a complaint from  using her trade name of mabel white dolen posted all of our names along with her delusional accusations about us  of course its just my opinion but i would never do business with someone who demonstrates such unprofessional unbalanced and disturbing behavior but then again i have no interest in homemade lotions potions perfumes candy or coffee flavor oils  and would never purchased from a business that was not licensed reputable andor have fda approval on their products after all these bathroomchemist type businesses can too easily substitute canola oil as cheap fillers for essential oils for example why am i being so tacky and blogging about this no it isnt like me but because my family and i have been inconvenienced for several years by having our names associated with this convicted felon i am personally sick of deborah dolens lies threats dogmatic delusional pro se legal attacks constant attempts to libel and disparage us and demands of money from us in my opinion this woman has obviously caused her own problems because of the poor and dishonest choices she has made and continues to make in life and neither i nor any member of my family has had anything to do with her her history her problems her scams or anything else she may dream up claim and sue us for  as famous as she may think she is she was as is inconsequential to us as we had never even heard of her or her claimed trade name of mabel white an alias name she has used freely and directly to libel and harass us prior to her unwarranted attack on us what was a clear and undisputable fact in our world was that this plaintiff prior to anyone in my family having any idea that she existed was conspiring against us researching our assets posting libelous content about us online and had already gathered our names address phone numbers personal emails work emails and other personal information and yet her claim is that we had been stalking her  deborah dolen has since continued to harass my family by publishing our names and address online posting distasteful and delusional online comments and outbursts complete lies libel libel per se and has even published a selfauthored fake and unsigned court order against us again go figure i am confident that plaintiff deborah r dolen aka author mabel white mustve realized at some point that her fictional claims against us had no merit whatsoever and were solely based from the unsupported claims and gossip of her only source my husbands ex angela ledcke who has personally published online that she is a diagnosed schizophrenic whatever delusional entitlement this person may think she has to be able to pick someone out of thin air to sue trash and harass and attempt to extort money from she needs to face reality and realize that she made a poor decision when she attacked my family with her lawsuit lottery game she has never know anything about us and i daresay that if she had she would be surprised to discover just who she choose to target  i am also convinced that pride arrogance meanspirited gaming and greed outweighs her ability to recognize reality and ever admit that she was completely and totally wrong in the fantasyfilled conclusions assumptions and allegations she made against my family and in naming us in her ridiculous  nonsensical federal lawsuit  followup july   since writing about my experience in the above content on my blog bogus lawsuit filerpro se plaintiff deborah r dolen aka author mabel white  motioned the federal court in the middle district of florida for injunctive relief to shut down my entire blog and she continued to demand money from us although that motion was filled with more lies complete delusions and whatever fantasies filled her head at the time of filing the motion was denied  after the court ordered her to amend her federal complaint she made a few more attempts at making demands from us and even though we ignored her she eventually dropped my family from her newest amended bogus federal complaint we stood up to this vexatious lawsuit bully and with any luck plaintiff deborah r dolen aka author mabel white will not be able to victimize others with her vexatious pro se litigation games in the future aside from the fact that she often portrays herself as one of the rich and famous sadly this person as we have found through our personal experience demonstrates a total lack of connection with reality and in our opinion is nothing more than a bully a nut and a delusional wannabe seeking attention october    here we go again i am always shocked that there are people who simply do not recognize the consequences of their own actions dolen targeting my family in a vexatious lawsuit brought with it the consequence of me starting this blog because she brought my name online in order to try and trash and damage me in some way i felt i had the right to defend my name from her delusional rants in reality my blog never wouldve existed or at least she never wouldve been mentioned because after all without the actions she took in targeting us i never would have known who she was shes not as famous in reality as she seems to be in her own mind its just that simple yet something this person does not seem to understand instead she has continued to blame others for her own actions and threw a fit in federal court because i blogged about our experience of being the target of her latest scam attempt to continue the craziness this pro se plaintiff deborah dolen then petitioned the court to amend her lawsuit for the third time to once again add us back into her federal complaint of concocted allegations  simply as a temper fit and to try and restrict me from using her names and journaling on my blog what she has done to us she seemed to think that i had no right to use the very names that she so freely used in her attempts to publicly mock disparage bully cyberstalk cyber smear harass threaten libel and sue us with in bad faith as has been her usual pattern she added new completely crazy and concocted theories and fantasy allegations to her motion to amend this time she claimed and submitted an exhibit in the case that someone known as the water filer lady would sign a formal declaration against us because this water filter lady person received an email from someone as you can see from the pdf of this email the unknown senders name and information had been redacted from this socalled exhibit so anyone couldve sent it  including our plaintiff in our world we have never come across someone that could act so outrageously irrational and crazy but i have to admit deborah dolen as mabel white ceo did email us during the phase of her harassment campaign where she was emailing us threats via our employers to warn us that she can do crazy excerpt from one of her harassing emails to us even after being removed from dolens federal complaint in june of  in her attempt to further harass us in early  dolen published several online articles that intentionally and falsely stated that we were still defendants in this case and going to trial as cyberstalkers she was also publicly gloating because of having associated our names with those damaging labels with the exception of one lets say lessthancredible source a website owned by june maxam northcountrygazetteorg all other site owners after simply reading the irrational and ridiculous articles immediately responsibly and respectfully removed dolens bullying libel game from their online publications apparently june maxam is known for the same sort of nonsensicality and for imagining herself to be a news correspondent of some sort when asked to remove the articles she had published maxam ignorantly referenced dolens obsolete complaint that the court had previously dismissed removing us from as defendants from the case and insisted that i did go to trial as a defendant she simply responded that i was wrong in stating that i had not been a defendant at the trail some reporter  huh ive discovered that ethics principles and rationality all seem to run scarce in the world of felons and fruitcakes june maxam through her webhost challenged me to sue but suing the insolvent seems like a senseless waste of time an extra helping of insanity i personally witnessed more insane conduct in this one bogus and vexatious lawsuit filed by pro se plaintiff deborah r dolen than i think ive seen collective from anyone in my lifetime maybe thats because by choice ive never had any association with this type of unscrupulous person before some of the tactics this plaintiff has used has been beyond what anyone with an ounce of honesty andor credibility would attempt although she omitted my family from her nd amended complaint and threatened that if we continued with our counterclaims that she would motion to add us back in she actually seemed to believe that she could simply invent claims against us and act as though we were still included in her bogus lawsuit in some crazy attempt to try and intimidate me dolen listed my ex husband on her new witness list and stated that he would testify against my character when asked about this my ex said he had never even heard of deborah r dolen and that he had no intention of making any statement or testimony against me somehow in her own little world she mustve theorized that because he was an ex that he would have something negative to say about me dolen actually included this rambling and delusional theory in one of her pleadings and even intimated that hed left me in our marriage as with all of her assumptions and claims it doesnt seem to matter to her that she has absolutely no idea what shes talking about because she doesnt know anything about us dolen claimed throughout the years that this case spanned that we confused the federal court judge in texas which resulted in the orders and decisions made in our favor in this case that we prejudiced the mediator and experienced criminal attorney against her that we tampered with the imaginary potential jury pool that i personally witness tampered because of my blog and even that we tainted the federal court magistrate judge in tampa all that and yet i cant even get the postman to stop walking on my lawn federal court orders and case decisions in dolen v ryals et al february    deborah dolens lawsuit and all claims against us are dismissed for the first day in over two years my family and i are no longer being sued and harassed in federal court by pro se plaintiff deborah r dolen aka author mabel white in a targeted nonsensical and fictitious lawsuit lottery game the federal court ruled on the  pleadings and all of deborah dolens delusional and bogus claims against my family and me were dismissed with prejudice today in our favor and she is now barred from ever making those claims against us again predictably she somehow thought and immediately boasted in an email to our attorney that this decision was in her favor as the federal court order stated about claimthrower deborah r dolens tortuous action enough is enough  order of dismissal  our counterclaims were dismissed in that case but were dismissed without prejudice allowing us to reassert them in a separate action when and where we choose there wouldnt be much use for this however because dolen is what the courts commonly refer to as a insolvent defendant simply put she has nothing deborah dolens lawsuit is dismissed at trial by federal judge april    julie ryals receives a judgment against deborah r dolen and all of dolens claims are dismissed with prejudice deborah dolens vexatious and nonsensical lawsuit against julie ryals came to trial before the federal court in tampa florida on april   the issues were set before a jury on the third day of the trial after deborah dolen completed her performance as ringmaster for her own dog and pony show in response to a verbal motion by julie ryals attorney the federal judge made a decision based on the case presented and immediately dismissed all of deborah dolens claims against julie ryals with prejudice meaning that dolen cannot bring those claims again the federal judge in tampa told dolen that she quote did not show even the most minuscule ounce of proof to her claims dolen had said in published media interviews she had created by interviewing herself that she would not fall into the sand trap of having to provide proof of her unsupported allegations but would instead bring in her own witnesses to simply testify the old fashioned way because dolen had no proof but had been bulldozing through this case with only threats bullying and meritless and unsupported accusations it was no surprise that this desperate plan was actually put into play dolen introduced the testimonies of annette bartowsheski aka annette lahr from minnesota and sheryl farley aka sherry lynn farley of bradenton fl  two anonymous and scripted witnesses that dolen brought in off the streets who were willing to lie and perjure themselves in federal court for her cause i have to wonder if they realized while testifying under oath and the penalty of perjury that the scripting they received from dolen was overheard and that dolen had also confided in a friend who shared their plan in addition to the scripted testimony agenda annette bartowsheski annette lahr seemed to think it worthy to point out to the federal judge that she didnt think it was fair that i hadnt published a negative ugly comment that she submitted to my blog her comment by the way was the only negativeugly comment i have ever received and it was one that fell into the irrational nutcase category bartowsheski lahr also via her affidavit and testimony stated and complained to the federal court that my blog was too long i suppose i was unaware that this was a federal courtworthy issue or offense but like i said irrational nutcase  witness sherry farley clearly not in her right mind was even less rational and in addition to her testimony being completely offthewall crazy she told the court that her deceased mother had spoken to her by way of a tree falling on her house and told her to help deborah dolen despite these witnesses and ridiculous testimonial scripts and transparent attempts to manufacture the necessary evidence by inventing it on the stand aka perjury the federal judge dismissed their foolery and disciplined dolen  stating that she had an infinitesimalinfinity chance of prevailing in this case direct quote when dolen uttered a confused awha the federal judge clarified by saying that dolen had a snowballs chance in hell of prevailing on any claims made against mrs ryals another direct quote he further instructed pro se plaintiff deborah r dolen aka mabel white that she is forbidden from ever bringing any claims she made or could have made against julie ryals in this case in the future in any court therefore dismissing all claims against julie ryals by deborah dolen with prejudice  pending was julie ryals counterclaim of cybersquatting for the domain julieryalscom which dolen had originally purchased at the onset of this lawsuit endeavor to use as a tool for libeling namecalling and attempting to extort a cash settlement in the case dolen had kept this domain for  months until eventually abandoning the domain and letting it expire  at which time julieryalscom was recovered by julie ryals because this  counter claim was at this point moot it was also dismissed the federal courts final decision in deborah dolens vexatious lawsuit it is ordered and adjudged that judgment is entered against deborah r dolen and for julie ryals on all deborah r dolens claims despite deborah dolens continued delusions of the outcome of her fictional lawsuit the orders of the court speak for themselves defendants motion for fees against deborah dolen  re plaintiff dolens bad faith litigation order granting defendants motion for fees against plaintiff deborah r dolen etc deborah dolen attempts to recuse federal magistrate judge and fails deborah dolens response and threats via email  including additional excuses she did respond and her response to the court was a fireworks finale of crazy the ditching any fees awarded to us in  months threatened by dolen in this email was referencing her calculated upcoming bankruptcy in  months when she would be eligible to file again estimated to be in midtolate  florida court finds that pro se litigant deborah dolen engaged in vexatious conduct vexatious conduct as defined by the court is conduct that is an abuse of the judicial process and serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action the plaintiff makes several baseless arguments cites to inapplicable case law and most importantly does not refute the defendants allegations concerning her alleged vexatious litigation tactics after a review of the procedural history of this case it is clear that the plaintiff engaged in vexatious and unreasonable conduct that multiplied the proceedings pages  and  vexatious conduct as defined by the court is conduct that is an abuse of the judicial process and serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action deborah dolen files affidavit of indigency to proceed in appeals court  even after all of her claims had been dismissed and unproven dolen continues to make her same unsupported delusions about us in an application to proceed to the appeals court and have the fees waived this affidavit for indigency included a statement that dolen owed her witness  sheryl farley of bradenton close to  for trial expenses was this a payment for farleys manufactured testimony when sheryl farley wasnt paid this amount dolen promised she placed a lien against the title of deborah dolens vehicle the final judgment for fees against plaintiff deborah r dolen  march   although it probably goes without saying the simple fact that deborah dolen remained pro se throughout the history of this extortion attempt case is another indication of how baseless and unfounded her claims were and are if her claims had held any merit or truth contingency attorneys wouldve been lined up to jump on the case instead they continued to warn her of her liability in pursuing  as did the various judges involved i have to wonder if the plan to get us coaxed by dolens abettor angela schubart ledcke was worth it for her she has built up such massive hatred toward us because we refused to be bullied that i doubt if she has yet to realize how she was played by ledcke andor the permanent impact this entire endeavor has had and will have on her id be willing to expect that she will never allow herself to digest the actual reality of her ruin or why we now hold a judgment lien against her image version of judgment lien against pro se plaintiff deborah r dolen for her vexatious conduct so who was arden postfinal judgment posting topix poster arden was actually suzanne rossignol a young woman from lake city florida i found this out early in the case in  through a simple method of googling her topix screen name that included her email via her topix profile and then doing a search on facebook using that email this was something so simple and something pro se plaintiff dolen could have and should have easily done before suing me in federal court because of her lamebrain assumption that i was this topix poster its called due diligence this is one more reason why the attack on my family was calculated and nothing short of an act of revenge instigated by my husbands ex and carried out by her greedy scamming convicted felon friend who had nothing to lose and what she thought would be everything to gain after discovering who arden actually was i called suzanne to suggest that she stop acting in such a reckless and irresponsible manner online and told her that if i was able to find her real identity and contact information so easily that anyone could at first she was frightened by my call but i told her that it was dolens responsibility to discover who she was and assured her that i would not personally volunteer her identity during the case her response was something that i still find to be astounding she told me that she comes from a good family and that her actions on topix would affect that good familys good standing if they were to find out how she had been behaving apparently my family was somehow perceived to be inferior i suppose so it was okay for me to take the blame for her words and behavior although dolen did eventually discover ardens true identity during the case she was too far into it and her extortion attempts to admit it arden being someone else wasnt part of dolen and ledckes plan suzanne never came forward and she let me take the full consequences and backlash for her actions thankfully my familys good name was outstanding enough to bear up a new theory yes in  deborah dolen came up with another new theory and hysterically claimed proof of who was behind the online nonsense claiming that we were in cahoots with her ex boyfriend the one who paid her  to get out of his life apparently deborah dolen and this mans latest ex had become buds and this ex jennifer coppockbeauseigle personally emailed me with a bait question inquiring if i had any diabetic recipes huh im not diabetic my response to her was clear and concise in saying that i found it less of a coincidence that she had contacted me as i recognized her last name as being the name on my caller id when dolen was using their exs cell phone to call and harass us its a rare last name and one that i remembered and i asked her what her intent was behind the email my reply was apparently shared with dolen by this woman and they whirlwinded a new theory that this ex of theirs had paid my family and me to go after dolen i never realized how many lunatics were lurking out there if nothing else had convinced us that this deborah dolen woman was completely unhinged and a delusional nutcase this did the trick she can pretend all she wants online that she is famous and important and even that she is now saved and a christian in real life weve seen nothing but evil exuding from this woman in every way and weve experienced the truth in my opinion a genuinely saved person would have humbled themselves without hesitation and admitted that their intent abuse and actions against us were wrong and a saved person would have without question made some effort to reconcile their wrongdoing and devilspirited intentions against us instead deborah dolen has continued to lie about her intent ignore our judgment against her bash our names and has even gone on to sue others in her quest for monetary settlements   more case information   in matters of style swim with the current in matters of principle stand like a rock  thomas jefferson disclaimer this is my own personal blog where i
