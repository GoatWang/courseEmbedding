analysts commented given signs of a bottoming in the latter and pnrs latecycle sales mix we think this outgrowth is unlikely to accelerate while its markets are strong now we note that pnrs cyclicality was no lower than the sector average during the  downturn analyst julian mitchell wrote in a note that said mitchell noted that the company should continue to record strong margin growth while its operating margins have increased by about bps over the past three yearsrelated link cowen  company downgrades pentair to underperformwe view five business units  percent of sales as underearning today in that they offer bps of margin expansion opportunity we assume that twothirds of this opportunity equating to – of eps is indeed realized in the next few years mitchell continued meanwhile investors would focus on how the company deploys its vc proceeds while the company is keen to put the remaining balance sheet capacity of  billion to workmitchell said although the move would add  to eps it would increase the leverage at the very top of the largecap eemi leverage spectrum implying x nd ebitda and back to a level which management apparently found too highnotably the main aim behind the sale of vc was to reduce the leveragethere is a risk that pnr uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough vc to buy businesses that may be close to a cyclical peak in water ts and the company seems willing to return to a similar balance sheet leverage level x as before the vc sale took place  who are some of pentair plcs key competitors some
