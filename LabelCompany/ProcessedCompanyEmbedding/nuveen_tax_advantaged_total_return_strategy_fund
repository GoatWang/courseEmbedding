frequently trade at a discount to their nav  at any point in time your common shares may be worth less than you paid even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributionscommon stock risk common stock returns often have experienced significant volatilitysenior loan risk senior loans both secured and unsecured may not be rated by a national rating agency are  generally not registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and generally are not listed on a securities exchange consequently the amount of public information available about senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for more widely rated registered and exchangelisted securities  in addition some adjustable rate loans may be unsecured or insufficiently collateralized which increases the risk of fund losses if the loan’s issuer defaultscredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposesleverage risk the fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share nav market price and distributions  leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio whether that return is positive or negative leverage is intended to increase common share net income but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage including swaps may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitstax risk the tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the internal revenue service or state tax authoritiesforeign investment

the value of the fund’s investments as well as adverse political social and economic developments these risks often are magnified in emerging marketspreferred securities risk preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure and therefore are subject to greater credit riskinterest rate risk fixedincome securities such as bonds preferred convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates risebasis risk as shortterm rates change interest from floating rate loans may not increase in concert with

potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind  meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio holdings of securities rather than cash by avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions nextshares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions and associated shareholder taxes the enhanced tax efficiency that nextshares may provide can be a meaningful source of improved investor outcomes bottom line nextshares can reduce fund taxable gains a fund’s investment strategy and portfolio turnover rate are other important determinants of the frequency and amount of its capital gains distributions fund distributions of net shortterm capital gains are generally taxable as ordinary income distributions of net gains from investments held by the fund for more than one year are generally taxable at longterm capital gains rates the tax character of fund distributions is determined and provided to shareholders after the end of each calendar year in addition to capital gains distributions fund distributions may include nonqualified ordinary dividends taxed at ordinary income tax rates qualified dividends taxed at rates applicable to longterm capital gains if holding period and other requirements are met exemptinterest dividends not subject to regular federal income tax and nondividend or return of capital distributions which are not subject to current tax a nextshares fund’s redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in

taxes resulting from fund distributions reduced annual returns of actively managed us equity mutual funds by an average of  over the past  years and  over the past three years for individual investors
