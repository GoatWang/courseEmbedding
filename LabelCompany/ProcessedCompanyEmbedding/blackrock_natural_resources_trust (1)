overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year

portfolio turnover the natural resources fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the natural resources funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the natural resources funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies of the fund   the natural resources fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in equity securities of companies with substantial natural resource assets under normal circumstances the natural resources fund will invest at least  of its assets in companies with substantial natural resource assets or in securities the value of which is related to the market value of some natural resource asset equity securities include common stock preferred stock securities convertible into common stock or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock natural resource assets include materials with economic value that are derived from natural sources either directly or indirectly such as metals fuels timber underdeveloped land and agricultural products eg fertilizer and chemicals the natural resources fund normally invests in a portfolio consisting of companies in a variety of natural resource related sectors such as energy chemicals oil gas paper mining steel or agricultural products the natural resources fund focuses on investments in companies that provide exposure to commodities where existing and projected capacity is forecast to approach levels that represent full utilization of that capacity based upon supply and demand forecasts for the commodity under certain circumstances however the natural resources fund may concentrate its investments in one or more of these sectors or in one or more issuers in the natural resources related industries the natural resources fund is a nondiversified fund which means that it can invest more of its assets in fewer companies than other funds the natural resources fund will normally invest in both us and nonus companies including companies located in emerging markets and in securities denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies the natural resources fund may invest in securities of issuers with any market capitalization   the natural resources fund chooses securities using a combination of top down and bottom up investment styles   principal risks of investing in the fund   risk is inherent in all investing the value of your investment in the natural resources fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time you may lose part or all of your investment in the natural resources fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments the following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the natural resources fund   n   emerging markets risk  emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns to us investors in addition many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets    n   equity securities risk  stock markets are volatile the price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a companys financial condition and overall market and economic conditions   n   foreign securities risk  foreign investments often involve special risks not present in us investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money these risks include     n   the fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight     n   changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the funds portfolio     n   the economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the united states with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product reinvestment of capital resources and balance of payments position     n   the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries     n   many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the united states and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to us securities laws     n   settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of us investments   n   market risk and selection risk  market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the fund invests will go down in value including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by fund management will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies this means you may lose money   n   mid cap securities risk  the securities of mid cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies   n   natural resource related securities risk  because the fund concentrates its investments in natural resource related securities the fund is subject to the risks associated with natural resource investments in addition to the general risk of the stock market this means the fund is more vulnerable to the price movements of natural resources and factors that particularly affect the oil gas mining energy chemicals paper steel or agriculture sectors than a more broadly diversified fund because the fund invests primarily in companies with natural resource assets there is the risk that the fund will perform poorly during a downturn in natural resource prices   n   nondiversification risk  the fund is a nondiversified fund because the fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely   n   precious metal related securities  prices of precious metals and of precious metal related securities historically have been very volatile the high volatility of precious metal prices may adversely affect the financial condition of companies involved with precious metals the production and sale of precious metals by governments or central banks or other larger holders can be affected by various economic financial social and political factors which may be unpredictable and may have a significant impact on the prices of precious metals other factors that may affect the prices of precious metals and securities related to them include changes in inflation the outlook for inflation and changes in industrial and commercial demand for precious metals   n   sector risk  sector risk is the risk that the funds concentration in the securities of companies in a specific market sector or industry will cause the fund to be more exposed to the price movements of companies in and developments affecting that sector than a more broadly diversified fund because the fund invests primarily in one sector there is the risk that the fund will perform poorly during a downturn in that sector   n   value investing style risk  the fund follows an investing style that favors value investments historically value investments have performed best during periods of economic recovery therefore the value investing style may over time go in and out of favor at times when the value investing style is out of favor the fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investing styles    performance information   the information shows you how the natural resources
