case of professor robertson smith was held in the christian institute there was a large attendance of officebearers the chair was occupied by dr wg blackie and beside him on the platform were the rev mr scrymgeour sheriff murray professor mkendrick and messrs jas campbell of tulliechewan thos russell of ascog peter gardner ws gw clark john mclure walter duncan jmorison rrule walter macfarlane a a ferguson jhart jl mitchell jlawson boyd campbellliouglas gilbert eeith ncaw sbarclay as taylor alex avatt and gm kerr ike the meeting having been opened with prayer by the rev mr scrymgeour the chairman said in the first instance he had to read certain letters of apology which had been received from some gentlemen who were prevented being present the first was from the lord dean of guild who said that while he was not learned enough to form an opinion on questions of hebrew scholarship he professed to have an opinion on the more important question of justice and fair dealing he trusted that the next general assembly might find the recent proceedings of the commission to be unconstitutional otherwise the general principle of presbyterian church government would fall under public condemnation letters had also been received from mr james stevenson from mr as baird from mr ness bellahouston academy from mr james templeton and from dr anderson kirkwood the chairman then said fellow officebearers we are met tonight for a very grave and important purpose to call in question the legality and wisdom of the action of one of our church courts we are met because we believe our liberties as officebearers of the free church are endangered by the recent action of the commission of the general assembly in the case of professor robertson smith and at the same time to take such steps as may be competent to preserve our status and defend our rights we are not to discuss the merits of professor robertson smiths case we leave them to be dealt with by the constitutional church courts consequently those who hold opposite views respecting the merits of that case may consistently unite together in carrying out the objects of this meeting about the publisher forgotten books
