warm that is the question well at least a concern for those dry eye minded individuals having said that did you know that the human body can regulate core temperature between °f and °f when the ambient temperature is between °f and °f this is remarkable in that the ambient temperature can vary significantly while the internal core temperature remains tightly controlled in this weeks research update you will discover that measurement of the internal eyelid in normal subjects is lower—on average °c °f—than the average normal core temperature of  °c  °f our eyelids are certainly external and would thus be expected to be lower in temperature than our core but how much lower can they be to maintain normal function and by normal function i mean normally acting meibomian glands secreting healthy nonhazy or opaque solidified meibum this normal oillike meibum is the end goal of lid hygiene and warm compress therapy—shouldnt we try to get there clinically i live in houston it is warm understatement here—really warm in the summer i can honestly say that when it is really hot outside i am not thinking about how hot my eyelids might be—and how the outdoor environment might affect that what if my body was able to keep my lids cooler even when i wasnt what we dont understand is what temperature loss or even temperature regulation of the lids results in a change to the secretions and if warming the lids through warm compress therapy will return the lids to normalcy clinically warm compress therapy as well as the new lipiflow treatment would augment the bodys ability to warm the eyelids—and thus normalize the eyelid temperature regardless of why the lids were cooler warming in theory makes sense the challenge lies in making this concept manageable and accessible to our

clinical trial study was a doublemasked multicenter randomized placebocontrolled study to evaluate two doses of ebi over a sixweek period in subjects with dry eye disease the trial enrolled  subjects and was conducted in multiple centers throughout the united states the primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of ebi along with additional assessments of efficacy of ebi in patients with dry eye disease the study was designed to assess activity of ebi to determine improvements in signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with ebi as compared to baseline as well as

by eye care practitioners most clinical tests schirmers test tear break up time addition of dyes to determine ocular surface staining are often invasive and the grading severity is subjective to overcome these difficulties noninvasive tests have been developed one such device is the thermographer which noninvasively measures the temperature of the ocular surface studies in the past have successfully used this device and also demonstrated that after sustained eye opening the central corneal temperature in dry eye patients to be lower than those in normal eyes although this technique has been around since the s the tests had to be carried out in specialized temperature and humidity controlled rooms considerable training and expertise was required to obtain measurements and post processing of the obtained data was also timeconsuming to overcome these difficulties an objective noninvasive and userfriendly device that is specialized to measure ocular surface temperature was developed by tomoyuki kamao and colleagues tomey corp nagoya japan they used this thermographer as a screening tool for dry eye disease and the original abstract is presented as the abstract of the

correlation between the surface temperature and other ocular surface parameters including the central cornea and tarsal conjunctiva both upper and lower measured using the tomey ocular surface thermographer the results of this preliminary study showed that decreased conjunctival temperature was associated with an increase in the viscosity of the meibum which could potentially induce obstructive mgd the authors also speculated that impeded blood flow might lead to the decreased conjunctival temperature in patients with obstructive mgd although tomey ocular surface thermographer instrument is not currently available in north america the concept of thermography as a screening tool in mgd is novel if further research could establish a strong relationship between measuring

meibomian glands mgs is an integral component to the ocular surface evaluation and your technique should vary depending on what you want to accomplish routine mg expression for all patients is recommended as a screening test for nonobvious mgd using your thumb or forefinger apply moderate pressure just beneath the inferior lash margin above if upper lid and observe the material that emerges from the glands clear to slightly yellowish oil is a sign of meibomian gland vitality granular turbid opaque or inspissated meibum should prompt a more thorough evaluation for the symptomatic patient diagnostic expression of the mgs requires the application of a clinical scale to quantify some attribute the procedure is essentially the same apply external pressure to the lid margin and hold for  seconds some assign a grading scale to the amount of pressure needed to yield expression gentle forceful others prefer to grade the quality of the meibum expressed clear fluid granular whitishsemisolid yellowishsolid no expression alternatively you could count the number of expressible glands in a defined region of the lid ≥normal reduced for the established mgd patient consider therapeutically expressing the mgs here you need to apply significant force in order to fully evacuate thickened excreta so a drop of anesthetic may be helpful place a firm instrument such as a cotton swab paddlespatula or glass rod on the inner surface of the eyelid to avoid transferring the pressure to the globe sandwich the lid margin between your preferred finger and instrument and steadily squeeze to expel the inspissated meibum taking care to remain just beneath your patients pain threshold at all times practice your expressions the more meibum you see the better you will become at detecting abnormalities as always maintain uniformity between visits to track for changes  back to top   ocular surface update   norristown road suite  ambler pa  if you prefer not to receive email
