unbelievably brilliant the horizon a cleancut circle the air motionless cold  cold as death boundless space a small boat waiting waiting in this vast stillness waiting heartbreakingly in the offing a vast ship light streaming from her portholes her prow on an incline darkness comes to her suddenly the huge black hulk stands out in silhouette against the starlit sky silently the prow sinks deeper as if some titans hand inexorable as fate were drawing the great ship down to her death slowly slowly with hardly a ripple of that velvet sea she sinks out of sight then that vast emptiness was suddenly rent with a terrifying sound it rose like a column of heavy smoke it was so strong so imploring so insistent one thought it would even reach the throne of grace on high slowly it lost its force thinned to a tiny wisp of sound then to a pitiful whisper silence passengers on deck remained calm as they boarded the lifeboats eventually they decided mahala should get into one of the boats climbing aboard she requested that walter join her he replied no i must be a gentleman and turned away to join a group of men waiting for a later boat walter was last seen standing on the deck of the titanic wearing his tuxedo mahala recalled him helping women and children into the final lifeboats initial reports were sparse and contradictory the limits of wireless communication and the isolation of the disaster limited accurate information when word of the accident reached cedar rapids the magnitude of the disaster and the condition of either walter or mahala was unknown diaries in the brucemore archives document the reaction of the douglas family awaiting news in cedar rapids irenes entry on april  hints at the confusion surrounding the incident the news of titanics disaster came at noon while we were at luncheon  did not seem serious until evening about   spent the evening at the cedar rapids republican newspaper office having received no news george and irene left cedar rapids on april  to meet the ship carrying titanic survivors in new york on april  the cedar rapids evening gazette reported up to  oclock today no definite news had been received in cedar rapids concerning the fate of mr walter d douglas the wireless telegraph companies having great trouble in effecting communication with the carpathia it appears that a considerable number of the first and second cabin passengers especially the men must have perished but it is still hoped that mr douglas was among the ones rescued mrs douglas is on the carpathia but whether mr douglas went down with the boat as did many others of the male passengers remains to be determined in new york on april  thousands of people waited in the rain as the ship bearing the  survivors slowly approached the dock irenes entry for that date reflected the answer to the question the family and their community had been asking carpathia landed  in the eve walter not with mahala on april  eight days after the sinking the douglas family received word that walters body had been recovered by the cable ship mackay bennett and identified by his shirt and cigarette case both monogrammed wdd the ships crew recorded the following information no   male  estimated age   hair grey clothing  evening dress with wdd on shirt effects  gold watch chain gold cigarette case wdd five gold studs wedding ring on finger engraved may th  pocket letter case with  and one pound  note cards first class name  walter d douglas minneapolis walters remains were taken first to his home in minneapolis then via a special train to cedar rapids for entombment in the douglas family vault at oak hill cemetery mahala returned to her home on lake minnetonka minnesota accompanied only by berthe leroy an advocate of arts and culture she turned her estate into a showplace for extravagant gardens and furnishings collected from around the world mahala supported many local groups and charities including a donation in walters name to coe college salvaging the titanic in  rms titanic inc the company that owns salvage rights to the doomed vessel attempted to raise a section of the ships structure from the ocean floor as it fell back into the deep it landed upright in the muddy seabed affording the crew their first look at the side that had landed face down  years earlier historians originally identified the piece as the wall of a firstclass berth unoccupied on the voyage with their new perspective they discovered their earlier identification had been incorrect the large piece had actually been part of berth c occupied by walter and mahala douglas in august  dateline nbc and the discovery channel aired a primetime special featuring the story of the successful salvage of this large section of the titanic central to the hourlong segment was an interview at brucemore with borden stevens grandniece of walter and mahala  return to top  the douglas family servants domestic servants were integral to every part of the brucemore estate during the years the douglas family made brucemore their home at least ten servants were employed at any given time to clean the house care for the children cook the meals maintain the grounds greet visitors wash and iron clothing and a variety of other duties the hired help supported the familys lifestyle and allowed the douglases to pursue recreational hobbies artistic work and community service in the nineteenth and earlytwentiethcenturies many livein domestic servants worked for wealthy and middle class families with the lady of the house freed of house work she was able pursue cultural activities and become involved in her community most families employed one servant known as a maidofallwork in cedar rapids a small number had two servants and an exclusive group hired three or more servants the douglases a family of five employed one or two maids a butler a cook a nanny a coachman or chauffeur and a head gardener who supervised five to eight men on the grounds although the brucemore staff was quite sophisticated for cedar rapids it was small compared to those of their peers in other areas of the nation read about the douglas familys servants like other large homes built in the s the brucemore mansion had clearly defined areas for family and staff including separate entrances dining areas bathrooms and staircases concealed workspaces and living quarters made the servants virtually invisible to the family and their guests designed to be simple and functional the servants side allowed for the most efficient use of an employees time servants working for the douglases and other families across the country were expected to follow a strictly defined behavioral code and standard of work they were required to be neatly dressed polite and maintain a calm disposition at all times workdays were long as hired help would wake up before the family to clean the main rooms of the home prepare breakfast and serve family members as soon as they awoke a servants day would continue until the family retired for the night due to the long hours housing was provided for essential staff servants working inside the house maids butler and cook generally lived on the third floor of the mansion the head gardener and house staff with families lived onsite in the servants duplex the duplex was part of a small village that consisted of support and recreation buildings including a greenhouse barn chicken coop and squash court that later served as a bookbindery a different perspective the stories and roles of the douglases servants help provide another perspective on life at brucemore ella mcdannel  nanny one employee ella mcdannel had a very close relationship with the douglas family fondly named danny the nanny by the douglas girls danny worked for the family for over  years an americanborn woman she was the same age as irene and had a nursing degree the douglases hired her in january of  one month after barbaras birth her bedroom was on the second floor next to the nursery and her primary duties involved caring for the three girls in her diary she documented their milestones illnesses birthday parties sleepovers and other events as well as her daily activities and those of other servants dannys diary suggests that the staff shared some duties even though most multiservant households were very specialized her other tasks included washing mrs douglas hair cleaning dusting mending and sewing the second longest standing employee she left the family by  but remained in contact with them for the rest of her life bert batten  chauffer bert batten was the first member of his family to work at brucemore followed by his brother and sisterinlaw the battens came to the united states from england in  bert began working for the douglases in  and stayed until irenes death in  surpassing all other servants in length of employment as the chauffeur berts role was to drive and maintain the familys vehicles alfred and ivy batten  butler and maid berts brother and sisterinlaw alfred and ivy batten served as butler and maid for  years alfreds position gave him seniority over the other house staff his responsibilities included answering the door serving formal meals in the dining room and taking care of the silver and other precious items stored in the butlers pantry ivys duties included helping irene bathe and dress as well as general straightening and cleaning alfred and berts sisters and nieces worked for the douglases when extra help was needed for large parties mabel seay  cook a swedish cook mabel seay managed the kitchen and the elaborate formal dinners at brucemore additional maids most likely assisted her with the more tedious aspects of food preparation as well as washing dishes archie white  head gardener the head gardener was an important member of the staff and usually the highest paid employee onsite archie white the douglases last head gardener worked for the family for nearly  years his job included selecting plants operating the greenhouse and planning the care of the grounds in the spring and summer he supervised five or more gardeners in the winter his responsibilities included snow removal and firing up the boilers in the mansion as a knowledgeable gardener irene trusted archie completely with the care of the gardens and grounds while away from brucemore she wrote to him about maintenance issues and interesting plants she had seen during her travels archie who was born in jamaica british west indies married jeanie hepburn in cedar rapids they raised their children agnes and edward in the servants duplex social and cultural changes the douglases lived in a time when changes in society and culture made hiring managing and keeping servants more difficult although domestic service often paid better than factory or department store work the lack of personal freedom unpredictable and long hours and social stigma discouraged women from taking these positions as a result employers frequently turned to immigrants and minority populations as a source of help by the s the servant pool became even more limited due to world war i and immigration restrictions while middle class housewives stopped hiring livein servants in favor of new household appliances and day workers wealthy families continued to hire livein servants to illustrate social status and maintain their larger homes and estates iowa like other midwestern states had smaller servant populations than the northeast and south in linn county many bohemian and german immigrants along with americanborn girls worked as servants having male servants signified a high social position therefore men generally filled positions that required them to be visible to family and guests such as the butler or chauffeur the lives of individual servants often can be difficult to trace in some cases city directories and census records may provide the only source of information fortunately the stories of several servants at brucemore have been preserved through sources like diaries photos letters account books and other documents  return to top  history
