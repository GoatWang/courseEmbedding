directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with ifrs because adjusted income loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis excludes noncash stockbased compensation expense—a noncash expense we believe that this financial measure when considered together with our ifrs financial statements can enhance an overall understanding of cellectis’ financial performance moreover our management views the company’s operations and manages its business based in part on this financial measure in particular we believe that the elimination of noncash stockbased expenses from net income loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our core businesses our use of adjusted income loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under ifrs some of these limitations are a other companies including companies in our industry which use similar stockbased compensation may address the impact of noncash stockbased compensation expense differently and b other companies may report adjusted income loss attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure because of these and

architecture that contains an integrated microenvironment sensor low oxygen concentration is recognized as a hallmark of the microenvironment of certain solid tumors the implementation of the novel oxygen sensitive car architecture empowers car tcells with the possibility to autoregulate switch on or tuneup their functions in low oxygen hypoxic environments with the primary purpose of implementing additional levels of safety to the car tcell technologies in particular to minimize ontarget  offtumor” effects this study demonstrated the possibility to use peculiarities of the tumor microenvironment to create selfdecision making car tcells with impaired functions at high oxygen concentration the results showed that this system also possessed the key feature to be prone to quickly return to its off state in the absence of the inducing signal hypoxia a characteristic that is of prime interest to protect healthy tissues distant from the tumor site beyond this first in vitro proof

today announced the issuance of us patent  – which claims gene inactivation by use of chimeric restriction endonucleases this patent granted by the uspto to the institut pasteur and boston childrens hospital naming dr andré choulika and pr richard c mulligan as coinventors is exclusively licensed to cellectis this issued us patent  claims the method of introducing chromosomal modifications at a locus by induction of doublestranded dna cleavage using a chimeric restriction endonuclease and nonhomologous end joining recombination nhej this pivotal invention is at the basis of current nucleasebased precise gene inactivation techniques using chimeric restriction endonuclease such as cascrispr and related families zinc finger nucleases taleffector nucleases megatales some meganucleases ie endonucleases generated by the juxtaposition of specific dna binding sequences and dna cleavage domains with a recognition site of at least  base pairs this technology is universal as it can be applied to any types of cells including human animal plant cells or microorganisms this new patent follows us patent  issued on december th  which claims the use of chimeric restriction endonucleases for directing chromosomal gene editing in cells by homologous recombination this new patent complements cellectis’ strong portfolio of gene editing technologies that are implemented in its car tcell product candidates as well as within its minnesotabased agricultural biotechnology subsidiary calyxt which develops food products with healthier characteristics the inventors of this patent are dr andré choulika chairman  ceo of cellectis and one of the pioneers in the development of nucleasebased genome editing technologies and professor richard c mulligan mallinckrodt professor of genetics emeritus at harvard medical school and a founding partner of sarissa capital management professor mulligan is a worldrenowned scientist and former member of cellectis’ board of directors whose laboratory has made seminal contributions to the development of fundamental gene transfer and gene therapy technologies claim  of the us patent  “a method for attenuating or inactivating an endogenous gene of interest in a cell in vitro comprising inducing in the cell double stranded cleavage of chromosomal dna at a genomic site of interest in the specific sequence to be modified wherein the inducing comprises contacting the genomic site of interest with a chimeric restriction endonuclease said chimeric restriction endonuclease comprising a dna binding sequence and a dna cleavage domain and said restriction endonuclease recognizing a dna sequence of at least  bp wherein said restriction endonuclease is introduced as a protein or is encoded by a nucleic acid vector that is expressed thereby inducing a cellular repair mechanism which leads to highly efficient recombinational events at said genomic site of interest wherein said recombinational events introduce a mutation into said genomic site of interest thereby modifying the specific sequence in the chromosomal dna of the cell and thereby attenuating or inactivating an endogenous gene of interest in said cell” claim  of the us patent  “a method of modifying a specific sequence in chromosomal dna of a cell in vitro comprising inducing in the cell double stranded cleavage of chromosomal dna at a genomic site of interest in the specific sequence to be modified wherein the inducing comprises contacting the genomic site of interest with a chimeric restriction endonuclease said chimeric restriction endonuclease comprising a dna binding sequence and a dna cleavage domain and said restriction endonuclease recognizing a dna sequence of at least  bp wherein said restriction endonuclease is introduced as a protein or is encoded by a nucleic acid vector that is expressed and contacting said cell with a targeting dna or a nucleic acid vector encoding said targeting dna in an amount sufficient to produce recombination between said targeting dna and said chromosomal dna at the site of interest wherein said targeting dna comprises  dna homologous to the region surrounding the genomic site of interest and  dna which modifies the specific sequence upon recombination between said targeting dna and said chromosomal dna thereby modifying the specific sequence in the chromosomal dna of the cell” tue

alternext alcls – nasdaq clls today announced the publication of a study in scientific reports a nature publishing group journal describing the design and development of a new car architecture with an integrated switchon system that permits control over car tcell functions this integrated switchon system offers the advantages of controllable car tcells for safety while allowing for the possibility of multiple cytotoxicity cycles using a small molecule drugthe possibility to control spatially and temporally the car t activity is very desirable to mitigate potential unwanted risks such as cytokinerelease syndrome crs and the “ontarget offtumor” effect to date few strategies are available and mostly rely on suicide mechanisms that ultimately lead to a complete eradication of the engineered tcells thus resulting in a premature end of the treatment consequently implementing nonlethal spatiotemporal control of gene edited car tcells represents an important advancement in improving the car tcell technologyin this report alexandre juillerat phd and his collaborators engineered a system directly integrated within the car architecture in particular they showed that such system turns a car tcell from an offstate to an onstate upon addition of a small molecule inducing the cytolytic properties of the gene edited tcell overall this nonlethal system not only offers the advantage of a temporal control of activation to mitigate the risk of carinduced toxicities but also enables opportunities for spatial activation of the engineered car tcells using local targeted drug

geneediting company employing proprietary technologies to develop bestinclass car tcell products in adoptive immunotherapy for cancer today announced the publication of a study in cancer research describing the applicability of talen®mediated genome editing to a scalable process which enables the manufacturing of thirdparty car tcell immunotherapies adoptive immunotherapy using autologous tcells endowed with chimeric antigen receptors or cars has emerged as a powerful means of treating cancer however a limitation of this approach is that autologous car tcells must be generated on a custommade basis to overcome the limitations of patientderived car tcell therapies talen® mediated gene inactivation can be used to generate nonalloreactive tcells from thirdparty donors in a robust scalable manufacturing process thus allowing offtheshelf car tcell immunotherapieslaurent poirot phd and his collaborators use this talen®mediated editing approach to develop a process for the largescale manufacturing of tcells deficient in expression of both their tcell receptor tcr and cd a protein targeted by alemtuzumab a chemotherapeutic agent functionally tcells manufactured with this process do not mediate graftversushost reactions and are rendered resistant to destruction by alemtuzumab these characteristics enable the administration of alemtuzumab concurrently or prior to engineered tcells supporting their engraftment furthermore endowing the talen®engineered cells with a cd car led to efficient destruction of cd tumor targets even in the presence of the chemotherapeutic agent car tcell immunotherapies can therefore be used in an “offtheshelf” manner akin to other biological immunopharmaceuticalslaurent poirot phd head of early discoverydr laurent

adoptive transfer immunotherapy study highlights• the adoptive transfer of allogeneic car tcells represents a promising strategy to fight multiple cancers worldwide• cellectis has streamlined an engineering process to generate car tcells that could be compatible with allogeneic adoptive transfer in combination with nucleoside analogues lymphodepleting drugswhen allogeneic car tcell infusion is considered host versus graft and graft versus host reactions must be avoided to prevent rejection of adoptively transferred cells host tissue damages and to elicit significant antitumoral outcome in this report julien valton phd and his collaborators addressed these requirements by developing a multidrug resistant tcrαβdeficient car tcell this engineered tcell displayed efficient antitumor activity and significant resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogues which are currently used clinically in preconditioning lymphodepleting regimens their properties could prevent their alloreactivity and enable control over engraftment in patients in addition they are compatible in combination therapy an approach likely to improve clinical outcomes by providing a basic framework to

cross between biology – the study of life – and a range of technological breakthroughs from specific disciplines such as microbiology biochemistry biophysics genetics molecular biology computer science and more car cars or chimeric antigen receptors are engineered molecules that when present at the surface of tcells enable them to recognize specific proteins or antigens that are present on the surface of other cells these receptors are typically used to graft the specificity of an antibody derived from a single cell or a monoclonal antibody onto a tcell and provide it with a specific targeting mechanism to seek identify interact with and destroy the tumor cells bearing a selected antigen associated with that tumor also known as the tumorassociated antigen or taa cta in europe the clinical trial application cta filing is the regulatory step consisting in submitting the required study documentation package to the health authority to obtain the authorization to perform clinical investigation dna dna is a molecule that occurs in every living cell it contains all the information necessary for an organism to develop and function it is also the basis of heredity in that it is passed on either partially or in full during reproduction the genetic blueprint carried by dna constitutes an organism’s genome dna sequencing invented in the second half of the s dna sequencing involves determining the sequence of the nucleotides in a given dna fragment the dna sequence contains all of the information a living organism needs to survive and reproduce dna sequencing can be used in medicine to identify diagnose and possibly find cures for inherited or acquired genetic diseases in biology the study of dna sequences has become a key tool for example in detecting defective genes drug candidate after identification of a new potential target a product candidate or drug candidate is developed based on compounds with strong therapeutic potential electroporation or electropermeabilization is a microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane allowing chemicals drugs rna or dna to be introduced into the cell ema the european medicines agency ema is a european union agency whose main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use endonuclease an endonuclease is a type of nuclease nucleases cut nucleic acids into shorter fragments endonucleases can cut through the center of a polynucleotide chain as opposed to exonucleases which only cleave nucleotides from the ends of the chain enzyme enzymes are proteins that speed up catalyze reactions inside organisms while themselves remaining unchanged and without altering the substances taking part in the reaction without enzymes certain basic biological reactions would not happen fast enough enzymes enable new substances to be synthesized so that cells can form and grow anabolism they also help break substances down to provide the body with energy catabolism fda the food and drug administration fda is a federal agency of the united states department of health and human services responsible for protecting and promoting public health including through the regulation and supervision of biopharmaceuticals gene a gene is a segment of dna that provides the blueprint for making some part of a living organism dna is the basic constituent of chromosomes by which all creatures pass on their hereditary traits from parent to offspring the stretch of dna that makes up a gene is itself composed of nucleotides there are  types of nucleotides abbreviated as follows a for adenine t for thymine g for guanine and c for cytosine genome a genome is the full genetic make up of an individual or species encoded in its dna except for certain viruses which genome is carried by rna molecules the genome provides the layout for how cells should function and how hereditary traits should be passed down from one generation to the next it contains all the coding sequences of dna which are transcribed via messenger rna and translated into proteins as well as the non coding sequences which are not translated gmp good manufacturing practices gmp are a set of regulations applicable to the manufacturing of health products especially medicines intended for human use such as ucart product candidates for example a company is required to comply with gmp regulations in order to be granted from governmental regulatory agencies its license to manufacture pharmaceutical products gvhd graftversushost disease gvhd is a complication which follows an allogeneic tissue transplant consisting in immune cells in the graft recognizing the recipient as nonself and attacking its cells homologous recombination a genetic recombination event between two identical sequences located on two different dna molecules or separated from each other on the same molecule ind in the us the investigational new drug ind filing is the regulatory step consisting in submitting the required study documentation package to the health authority to obtain the authorization to perform clinical investigation knockin in molecular biology a knockin is the introduction of a gene of interest into a given locus after homologous recombination the gene of interest is controlled by the target gene’s promoter and regulatory sequences and is therefore synthesized in lieu of the target gene knockout in molecular biology a knockout or ko is the complete inactivation of a gene knockout is generally used when performing research on mammalian model species such as mice or rats or on human cell lines lentivirus lentivirus is a genus of retroviruses that cause chronic and deadly diseases characterized by long incubation periods in man and other mammalian species the best known lentivirus is the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids lymphocyte lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell as part of the immune system they play a major role in defending the body against infection they are produced in the bone marrow and circulate through the bloodstream and lymphatic tissues spleen lymph nodes there are two main types of lymphocyte b cells and t cells the difference between them is both molecular they bear different receptors on the surface of the cell and functional b lymphocytes produce antibodies while t lymphocytes kill or organize the fight against abnormal or infected cells lymphodepletion via chemotherapy lymphodepletion is a medical procedure in which certain immune cells are eliminated eg via chemotherapy to prevent the body from rejecting a transplant of engineered t cells meganucleases meganucleases are molecular dna scissors that can be used to replace remove or modify sequences in a highly targeted way these proteins are the perfect tools for genome engineering because they are specific enough to home in on and splice a single site per genome meganucleases are used to modify all genome types and open up wide avenues for innovation particularly in the field of human health for example by removing viral genetic material or repairing damaged genes and in agricultural biotechnology meganucleases can be found in many organisms such as archaea also archaebacteria bacteria phages fungi yeasts algae and certain plants nuclease an enzyme capable of catalyzing nucleic acids—rna ribonucleic acid and dna deoxyribonucleic acid—into nucleotides and various components of these nucleic acids they cut between two nucleotides in a nucleic acid strand nucleotide a nucleotide is a basic component of dna and rna it is a molecule composed of a sugar ribose or deoxyribose one to three phosphates and a nucleobase also known as a nitrogenous base certain nucleotides combine to form the basis of dna and rna while others are cofactors or coenzymesfor dna there are four different nucleotides each with a different nitrogenous base  damp a purine which nitrogenous base is adenine a  dgmp a purine which nitrogenous base is guanine g  tmp a pyrimidine which nitrogenous base is thymine t  dcmp a pyrimidine which nitrogenous base is cytosine c product candidate after identification of a new potential target a product candidate or drug candidate is developed based on compounds with strong therapeutic potential protein this is one of the most important types of molecules and is present in all living organisms and viruses proteins perform essential cellular functions such as the formation of cell architecture and the modulation of cell activity proteins are macromolecules that are composed of long chains of amino acids basic building blocks and come in various forms such as enzymes hormones receptors and neurotransmitters proteins are built from the genetic information contained in a gene rna ribonucleic acid rna is a biological molecule that occurs in virtually all living organisms including some viruses chemically it is very closely related to dna in fact rna is synthesized inside cells by copying dna strands living cells use rna especially as a messenger to convey genetic information so that our genes can make the proteins they need rna may also fulfill a number of other functions taking part in many chemical reactions at the cellular level for example tcell a tcell or t lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that helps trigger immune responses tcells find and destroy foreign pathogens such as bacteria and viruses but they will also attack the body’s own cells if those cells have undergone abnormal eg cancerous transformations talen® talen® is designed by fusing the dnacutting domain of a nuclease to tale domains which can be tailored to specifically recognize a unique dna sequence these fusion proteins serve as readily targetable “dna scissors” for gene editing applications that enable us to perform targeted genome modifications such as sequence insertion deletion repair and replacement in living cells talen® is a registered trademark owned by the cellectis group ucart ucart universal
