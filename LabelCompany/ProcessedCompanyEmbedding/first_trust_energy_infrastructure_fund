paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website for estimates of distribution sources final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after yearend  total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a nondiversified closedend management investment company investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry including high interest costs high leverage costs the effects of economic slowdown surplus capacity increased competition uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers because the fund invests in nonus securities you may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar there can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the funds common shareholders will consist of taxadvantaged qualified dividend income use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings not fdic insured • not bank

the board of trustees of first trust energy infrastructure fund fif the “fund”  cusip c previously approved a managed distribution policy for the fund the “managed distribution plan” in reliance on exemptive relief received from the securities and exchange commission which permits the fund to make periodic distributions of longterm capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year the fund has declared a distribution payable on june   to shareholders of record as of june   with an exdividend date of june   this notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your fund’s distributions you should not draw any conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its managed distribution plan the following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the fund from the following sources net investment income “nii” net realized shortterm capital gains “stcg” net realized longterm capital gains “ltcg” and return of capital “roc” these estimates are based upon information as of may   are calculated based on a generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” basis and include the prior fiscal yearend undistributed net investment income the amounts and sources of distributions are expressed per common share

monthly distribution paid on june   the fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains therefore a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” based on net asset value “nav” as of may   total returns are through may   the fund anticipates that due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by master limited partnerships in which the fund invests a portion of distributions the fund makes to common shareholders may consist of a taxdeferred return of capital the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund will send you a form div for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes you should not use this notice as a substitute for your form div energy income partners llc “eip” serves as the fund’s investment subadvisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in mlps and other energy infrastructure securities eip is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area as of may   eip managed or supervised approximately  billion in client assets principal risk factors the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a nondiversified closedend management investment company because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry including high interest costs high leverage costs the effects of economic slowdown surplus capacity increased competition uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers because the fund invests in nonus securities you may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar there can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the fund’s common shareholders will consist of taxadvantaged qualified dividend income use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings forwardlooking statements certain statements made in this press release that are not historical facts are referred to as “forwardlooking statements” under the us federal securities laws actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forwardlooking statements due to numerous factors generally the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “project” “will” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements which generally are not historical in nature forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated in any forwardlooking statements you should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date they are made the fund
