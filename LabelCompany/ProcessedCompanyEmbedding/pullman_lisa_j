individuals who face recurrent psychiatric hospitalizations over a short period “i am interested in access and availability and engagement in mental health treatment” says mason in addition to the flexibility of the program students also benefit from strong academic support from faculty that span the three disciplines mason’s mentor and committee chair kenn daratha advised him on scholarly research and authored several publications with him john roll vice dean for research in the elson s floyd college of medicine was a staunch supporter of mason’s research and mel haberman professor in the college of nursing helped with grant development and research writing jae kennedy professor and chair of health policy and administration gave mason the opportunity to teach statistics to his graduate students graduate school associate dean patricia sturko and associate dean lisa gloss were essential in guiding mason through interdisciplinary research and providing a space to cultivate ideas with the support of his committee mason was the recipient of the  russ and anne fuller fellowship “the iidp gave me the opportunity and confidence to pursue research without any preconceived constraints” says mason “during my time in the program i really valued the expertise of my committee members and looked to their suggestions about how i could apply disciplinespecific knowledge to address overarching issues affecting behavioral health policy and treatment access” last december mason began working for premier inc a hospitalowned quality improvement organization based in charlotte north carolina he works specifically for a division of the company called premier research institute which interfaces with foundations university researchers and federal agencies to complete

to cuba studying life history theory and immune behaviors by cheryl reed when tiffany alvarez studied women’s health through the lens of life history theory as an undergraduate student and mcnair scholar at unlv she didn’t know how far it would eventually take her now a doctoral student at washington state university in evolutionary anthropology she is planning to study in cuba next summer with her advisor edward hagen the two will be investigating the effects of acute immune activation on components of pregnant women’s behavioral and biological immunity—or life history life history theory seeks to explain aspects of an organism’s anatomy and behavior in reference to the way its life histories have been shaped by natural selection the theory depends on principles of evolutionary biology and ecology and is widely used in other areas of science alvarez explained how recent discoveries show that immunity appears to have behavioral components often referred to as sickness behaviors which serve to reduce exposure to pathogens and conserve energy the features that characterize immunity are uniquely distinguished by their relationship with biological processes and also environmental contexts ranging from the sociopolitical to cultural and ecological an ecological immunity perspective acknowledges that culturally mediated class and sexspecific patterns of activity resource access and reproduction are sources of significant diversity that affect immune response she also explained that pregnancy is a reproductive state of unique immunity and a period of dynamic changes to immunocompetence in cuba alvarez and hagen will collect baseline levels of biological and behavior immunity from a sample of  pregnant women after the data is collected the researchers will randomize it into treatment groups that will receive different vaccines it is predicted that the treatment group who receives the influenza vaccine will report markedly higher behavioral immunity than the groups who received the placebo alvarez’s and hagen’s research will determine if acute immune activation alters the behaviors of pregnant women in ways predicted by life history theory specifically whether or not acute changes in pregnant women’s health status trigger a suite of compensatory behaviors that contribute to pathogen avoidance and mitigate energetic immune costs these findings will contribute to larger theoretical and empirical discussions regarding contextspecific variation in hostpathogen interactions and behavioral sickness symptom expression alvarez is a firstgeneration college student from last vegas nevada she is now on a streamline track to earn a master’s and doctoral degree in  years as a mcnair alumna and teaching assistant alvarez has the opportunity to spread her research passion to other students “my work is so exciting” says alvarez “my advisor is training me to be a peer and i find that to be so valuable” washington state
