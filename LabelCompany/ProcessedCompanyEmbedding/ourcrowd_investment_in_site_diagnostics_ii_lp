private equity in healthcare – a review of  niche investment areas written by scott becker brooke murphy geoff cockrell bart walker and amber walsh  april    print  email private equity investment in healthcare continues to grow considerably this article provides observations and insights on  investment niches it also provides some initial thoughts on the market as a whole   here we divide the article into two core parts first there is an overview of investment by private equity second the article discusses fifteen  specific investment areas  each market sector is listed here followed by whether we perceive that there is less equal or more private equity interest in that sector as compared to last year   forprofit hospitals and health systems less healthcare it and ehrs equal to more laboratory businesses equal to more significant risk factors medical devices equal to less behavioral health more urgent care equal to more dental practice management equal to more ambulatory surgery centers equal to less dermatology more care and case management more accountable care organizations and population health back office services more anesthesia practice management equal to more revenue cycle management equal to more specialty pharmacy equal to less and pain management equal to more overall there continues to be a tremendous amount of interest in the following sectors hospital companies physician practice management models dental dermatology anesthesia pain emergency and more lab and toxicology companies health it companies behavioral health dental practice management urgent care anesthesia dermatology pain management surgery center companies revenue cycle and back office services further we note some niches are receiving very high profits – generally due to a flooding of the space or regulatory or payor review this doesn’t last and timing of exit is often critical some sectors clearly deliver a product payors or patients of facilities really need or want – unless driven by propriety technology the profits in these areas are generally rationale not exorbitant margin some of the above market profits are driven by an ancillary effort than a core part of the business – eg lab profits in some practice or asc models or ancillary profits to pain management or dermatology models bart walker a partner at mcguirewoods llp summarizes certain initial thoughts as follows please read below under section ii investment areas for a fuller discussion of these areas labs  regulatory scrutiny of lab arrangements has remained extremely tight despite years of somewhat aggressive tactics by some entities oig and whistleblowers continue to find new fodder for litigation and investigations see “oig fraud alert on lab payments to physicians” july  “oig advisory opinion ” and the april  settlement with health diagnostics laboratory inc and singulex inc continually slashed rates for lab testing coupled with certain dominant players eg labcorp quest who often have exclusive arrangements with a lot of payers creates an environment that may encourage aggressive practices to remain a viable competitor dental  the dental industry remains incredibly fragmented  a number of wellfunded private equitybacked companies are working to roll up the space at the same time state boards are much more active in policing corporate practice of dentistry than their medical board counterparts urgent care after a hiatus of  months we are seeing a resurgence of interest in urgent care and some new and interesting models specifically around freestanding ers and joint ventured urgent care dermatology  the legal and regulatory issues surrounding dermatology are very interesting — these practices and groups potentially have elements of lab testing inoffice and ascbased surgery and cosmetics all under the same roof there has been a great deal of increased interest in dermatology pain management  a key challenge the pain management sector faces is tension among competing policy interests on the one hand you have the need for increased laboratory testing to make sure patients are on adequate doses and to try to combat opioid addiction problems but on the other hand you have challenges with overutilization that are hard to police  i healthcare investment overview  healthcare investment growth the healthcare arena has moved from a situation where boutique private equity funds and boutique lenders focused on the arena to a spot where all or most major lenders and private equity funds spend a great deal of time in the broader healthcare arena health care merger and acquisition activity grew by  percent in  to  transactions setting a new record for healthcare ma deal volume in  which held the previous record  deals were announced across  health care sectors spending in  reached  billion beating the previous record of  billion spent in all of  according to health care ma news healthcare is often defined for investment purposes to include several broad categories and dozens of niches healthcare includes providerbased companies  entities that actually serve patients such as providers and health systems such as nashville tennbased hospital operator hospital corporation of america  healthcare related or healthcare services eg health it and revenue cycle management companies or organizations that sell into or provide services to providers and  life sciences ie medical device and pharmaceutical companies such as johnson  johnson  the scope of private equity investment in healthcare in  slightly more than  billion a dramatic increase from  billion in  was reportedly invested in healthcare by private equity funds in the form of healthcare buyout deals globally according to bain as in previous years north america led investment activity five out of the top  deals involved targets in the us two megadeals contributed to the increase in value of deals from  the  billion purchase of multiplan led by starr investment holdings and partners group and the carlyle group’s approximately  billion purchase of johnson  johnson’s orthoclinical diagnostics business the average size of healthcarespecific funds fell in  after three consecutive years of growth according to pei research  analytics the average healthcarespecific fund in  was  million down from  million in  despite the fall average fund size remained well above postfinancial crisis lows of  and  which saw average sizes of  and  million respectively  ii investment areas  forprofit hospitals and health systems less interest there continues to be great interest in forprofit hospital companies the ppaca and king v burwell decision has largely been positive for the large hospital companies see “chs tenet hca lifepoint and uhs shares surge after scotus upholds subsidies” becker’s hospital review june  there are huge publicly traded forprofit companies that have enjoyed large growth in the last couple years such as hca and community health systems which acquired hma as well as smaller private equity hospitals that continue to aim for growth such as capella healthcare based in brentwood tenn among others capella recently sold for a reported  million dollars see “capella to be sold for m  things to know about the deal” becker’s hospital review july  in one example of why forprofit hospitals attract investors hca’s share prices have climbed steadily in recent years — up over  percent in the past  months alone — and the hospital operator’s main investors such as bain capital and kkr  co lp sold additional stakes in the public company for billions there remains huge interest and large transaction volume with the large hospital companies at the same time the last six months have been a tougher time for stock prices and results of the large for profit hospital companies the consolidation of large payers is of concern for hospitals health systems and private equity firms as payers consolidate power and become more interested in investment opportunities see “anthem buys cigna – and then there where three –  key points” see also “the  largest for profit hospital companies” private equity firms have also profited from recent megamergers in the forprofit space for instance blackstone group lp — nashville tennbased vanguard health systems’ largest shareholder — collected more than  million from vanguard’s sale to tenet healthcare corp in dallas in addition real estate investment trust ventas recently acquired ardent health services for  billion according to modern healthcare privateequity healthcare deals in recent years have included a string of hospital acquisitions and investors have said more deals will follow but with an influx of private equity comes the inevitable exit of those very same investors often within three to seven years and those investors seek to leave with healthy profits raising concerns that whatever profit they take could come at the expense of companies they own in regard to private equity in the forprofit space scott becker a partner at mcguirewoods llp said this is an area where there has been tremendous private equity investment already both with big hospital chains like hca and other big area hospitals  right now we are seeing some consolidation and merging of investments such as with capella however the influx of new investments has largely stalled   healthcare it and ehrs equal to more interest the healthcare it arena is one where there continues to be the proliferation of a ton of companies and investments some of which may take it to the next level  others of which will struggle to gain traction  according to bain private equity interest in health it assets was strong again in  but deal activity was tempered due to a longstanding trend of high valuations thanks to competition from strategics and strong financial markets enticing ipo markets also drove many vcbacked firms straight to ipo without passing through private equity ownership such as venturebacked firms castlight health and everyday health which made their ipo debuts in  unlike private equity activity venture capital investments flowed abundantly into the healthcare it segment in  according to rock health vc funding for us companies in the digital health space in  was  billion nearly equal to the total funding of the previous three years combined notable assets that received venture funding during the year were telemedicine company teledoc payer services asset medhok and respiratory digital therapy firm propeller health the level of venture activity heralds a sizable pool of assets to capture private equity interest in years to come even if some go straight to ipo or strategic buyers without passing through private equity hands a great deal of the health it action now focuses beyond the large ehr systems installed by hospitals and providers the ehr market has matured to a significant extent a oncecrowded field of vendors has narrowed significantly the top  ehr vendors account for nearly  percent of the total hospital ehr market epic cerner eclinicalworks allscripts practice fusion nextgen healthcare ge healthcare cerner athenahealth mckesson and amazing charts among physicians topused vendors include centricity practice fusion vacprs and athenahealth see “ things to know about the ehr market’s top vendors” becker’s hospital review july  hospitals and health systems are typically in the middle of the ehr discussion but payers are starting to enter the conversation as well with health insurance companies concerned with cutting down costs and improving the health outcomes of patient populations some payers such as aetna are now mining data collected from ehrs to try to intervene and steer consumers to a healthier lifestyle as the industry increasingly turns to data and analytics to address healthcare costs private equity investments in health it originally centered on ehr systems now it focuses just as much on systems that analyze data and a whole range of other applications veritas capital a new yorkbased private equity firm bought cloudbased data aggregate and analytics giant truven health analytics in  for  billion veritas sold truven to ibm watson health for  billion in february of    laboratory businesses equal to more interest significant risks over the last few years the oig has increased scrutiny on lab businesses due to expansion in this area for example the growth rate of lab business billed to medicare is three times that of other businesses see “doctors cash in on drug testing for seniors and medicare pays the bill wall street journal christopher weaver and anna wilde mathews – may   the lab business both on a large scale and small scale remains a huge area for investment coinciding with a focus on preventive care and coordinated efforts to treat patients with chronic disease for instance levine leichtman capital partners has invested  million in genova diagnostics inc a specialty clinical laboratory with a testing approach tailored to personalized treatment and prevention of chronic disease genesequencing giant illumina inc private equity firm warburg pincus llc and venture capital firm sutter hill ventures invested  million to seed a new consumerfacing human gene platform called helix in august  avista pharma solutions acquired the gmp contract manufacturing development and animal health services business of scynexis as part of the transaction avista will occupy scynexis’s former research and gmp manufacturing facility in durham nc and hire substantially all employees associated with the contract services business mr becker says  there is a good deal of risk in this sector as payers and the federal government try to discourage unneeded or excess testing as well as financial relationships with referral sources   there have also been well publicized challenges to major players in the sector such as with theranos  however there is serious growth in directtoconsumer testing and testing in the way of genomics and precision medicine   medical devices equal to less interest the medical device arena continues to focus around the five to  largest companies however there are hundreds of small and midsized device startups and small companies that are either trying to be entrepreneurial middle men or direct providers of devices medical device sales are expected to grow  percent annually through  as a result of technological innovation and the aging population although the industry faces some challenges such as reduced reimbursement the patient protection and affordable care act’s  percent medical device tax and the fda regulatory process fields such as orthopedics telehealth and mobile health have still experienced growth for example wall street health partners has invested  million in rti biologics’ purchase of pioneer surgical technology inc — a prominent provider of orthopedic and other biologic implants strategic buyers continued to dominate the medtech sector many sought to expand their product portfolios through acquisitions for example cardinal health purchased home healthcare supplier assuramed for  billion thermo fisher scientific acquired genetic testing firm life technologies for  billion and valeant pharmaceuticals bought bausch  lomb holdings for nearly  billion that competition — plus the general lumpiness and cyclicality of the sector — meant another down year for medtech private equity activity the only private equity deal worth more than  billion in the sector was kkr’s  billion stake in panasonic’s healthcare business as a result medtech represented only  percent of total healthcare private equity deal value and  percent of deal count notably there were additional private equity investments in multiindustry companies with medtech business lines such as cinven’s  billion acquisition of ceramtec a maker of ceramic parts for replacement knees and hips as well as components for the auto and electronics industries but this activity was not enough to change the overall balance between private equity and strategic buyers by much medtech investors continued to focus on productbased companies over servicebased ones for example anacacia capital acquired hills holdings’ healthcare equipment business other product subsectors that saw investments include diagnostic equipment orthopedic equipment medication delivery devices cardiac implants and dental implants there is also increased animal health interest such as the riverside company’s acquisition of a controlling stake in simcro a new zealand manufacturer of medication delivery devices for production animals  behavioral health more interest there has been a significant increase in investment interest in behavioral health including substance abuse businesses and this investment interest is widespread across the spectrum of investors interest has increased due to the rising demand for behavioral health services and the requirement that health insurance companies do not use more restrictive requirements when reimbursing mental health and substanceabuse related claims than they do with medical related claims in  an estimated  million americans needed addiction treatment for a problem related to drugs or alcohol within the past year of which only  million received treatment at a specialty facility according to a report from the national institute on drug abuse the combination of increased demand a lack of adequate providers and increased sources of payers has created opportunities for private equity investors in the behavioral health market according to a recent law report by industry experts from mcguirewoods and hcp  co the behavioral health sector saw a  percent increase in deal volume from  to  according to pwc in october of  acadia healthcare company bought crc health group from private equity firm bain capital for  billion meanwhile aac holdings the parent company of american addiction centers which operates six substance abuse facilities across the us has seen its shares climb  percent since its ipo last october the sector saw the entrance of seven new private equity firms within the first three quarters of  alone recovery centers of america rca is building eight substance use treatment centers in the northeast us in  driven by  million in financing from new york private equity firm deerfield management state and national legislative insurance changes have made substance use treatment a  billionayear industry according to a report from common health the ppaca’s expansion of coverage for behavioral health and substance abuse specifically has garnered the interest of investors reimbursement in this sector has been on the rise from  to  the national survey on drug use and health found the number of respondents using medicaid and medicare payments for treatment increased by  percent and  percent respectively   urgent care equal to more interest growth in related stand alone emergency department sector geoffrey cockrell chairman of the private equity group at mcguirewoods law firm offered the following insight on urgent care “two years ago urgent care was a whitehot industry then prices increased and the investing market dried up leaving only strategic buyers there are not many platforms of scale to support financial buyers’ investment recently however pricing has become more rational and the industry has come roaring back companies are now exploring additional elements such as primary care and entering rural markets” there is currently significant interest in investing in urgent care this includes investment in firms such as cvs’ minute clinic one of the first broadly rolled out urgent care companies to standalone emergency departments to simple urgent care units there was an almost  percent growth in existing clinics in the past four years with the total number of urgent care clinics exceeding  according to a february  mcguirewoods report the expansion is expected to continue ibis world estimates the sector will produce more than  billion in revenues in  at more than  clinics private equity investment has driven the expansion in recent years for example in june of last year abry partners a leading private equity firm completed a majority stake acquisition of fastmed urgent care the second largest independent urgent care organization in the us see “ things to know about urgent care” becker’s hospital review june  private equity firms arent the only ones taking note of the investment opportunity—urgent care investment has gained traction among insurers and hospital systems as well in april  unitedhealth groups optum portfolio acquired urgent care franchise medexpress and its  facilities with plans to open  new clinics in the  hospitalowners hca holdings and tenet healthcare have also invested aggressively in urgent care clinics hca expanded its ownership to  urgent care facilities by the close of fy  through strategic acquisitions like the purchase of coppell texasbased carenow tenet healthcares urgent care arm medpost launched in  has expanded into eight states along with growth in urgent care comes the evolution of orthopedicspecific urgent care this involves the development of urgent care models centered on particular specialties these are often created to feed an orthopedic practice as well as to generate  profit for instance orthonow has established itself as a franchise business of specialized orthopedic urgent care centers the company opened its first location in miami in  and became a franchise program last year with a network of urgent care centers according to a recent analysis of the urgent care industry despite a decrease in the number of urgent care clinics as of late investors have pumped roughly  billion into the burgeoning urgent care industry since  also in a  white paper from mcguirewoods and ucaa one industry professional predicted the urgent care industry will see a lot of activity through  and beyond since some large metropolitan areas could support two to three times the number of current urgent care providers  dental practice management equal to more interest according to mr becker the dental practice management sector has seen tremendous private equity investment during the past five to  years this makes sense as everyone needs dental services the money involved is material and there are still a large number of independent dentists in the past decade alone more than  private equity firms invested significantly in dental practice management and some large companies in the sector have seen annual revenue of more than  million this has evolved to the point where there are at least  largescale dental practice management companies in early july dental care alliance which reached  million in revenue in  was sold to new york private equity firm harvest partners lp the dental practice management has seen tremendous investment over the last  to  years  that stated dental is an area where all of the population needs dental help the money spent on it is material and there remain a large number of independent dentists  according to mr walker “dental practices continue to appeal to private equity funds because they’re mostly commercial pay or cash pay so there’s relatively low exposure to reimbursement changes from governmental payers and it’s a fragmented industry the top  companies only control  percent of the market so there’s lots of room to consolidate and aggregate practices together it’s still a pretty profitable business and there’s a need for their service”  other dpm models do focus heavily on medicaid patients mr walker also notes several recent deals in the sector  for example he notes the following three recent dental deals dental care alliance announces northeast dental management affiliation  practices across  states berkshire partners to acquire affordable care from american capital for  million dollars  affiliated practices in  states and blue sea capital investment in deca dental  practices  ambulatory surgery centers equal to less interest ascs have not experienced large growth recently however the approximately  ascs in the country continue to deliver solid profits according to a recent overview of the asc industry each year physicians perform more than  million procedures in ascs approximately  percent to  percent of ascs are owned or managed by multifacility chains roughly  percent of ascs were forprofit in  showing no change from the number of forprofit ascs in  the big four specialties for ascs include ophthalmology orthopedics gi and pain management according to an asc analysis overall these specialties remain strong and reasonably independent ophthalmology gi and pain management provide the largest number of cases to ascs by case volume orthopedics in contrast comprises  percent of all asc surgeries but is very important by revenue there are a number of companies that invest heavily in and manage ascs including some of the largest private equity firms in the country tpg capital has backed deerfield illbased surgical care affiliates which is one of the largest asc companies and led by andrew hayek welsh carson anderson  stowe has close ties with addison texasbased united surgical partners international led by brett brodnax another prominent asc company additionally in  private equity firm hig capital completed a major investment in tampa flabased surgery partners one of the largest asc operators in the southeast surgery partners led by mike doyle merged with symbion  in  amsurg corp led by chris holden acquired sheridan healthcare many deals occurring in the asc sector concern existing centers rather than startups and with many ascs remaining independent investors will continue to be attracted to the asc space it is anticipated that private equitybacked asc companies will begin considering new acquisitions for instance uspi which formed a joint venture with tenet has suggested it anticipates increased ma activity in the coming years as ascs partner with other providers to form strong affiliations in the face of healthcare reform challenges for ascs we have seen many of the companies diversify away from being straight asc companies says mr becker there has also been a fairly stable number of ascs for the last  to  years therefore chain store growth as well as growth in new facilities is relatively flat  dermatology more interest the dermatology arena has also experienced significant growth like pain management providers dermatologists offer professional services and there are opportunities for specific situations in dermatology where people make outsize profits some examples of recent dermatology transactions include new mainstream capitals  deal with anne arundel dermatology one of the largest dermatology providers in maryland and varsity healthcare partners  agreement to sell forefront management holdings a physician management group in dermatology to the private investment arm of pension fund giant ontario municipal employees retirement system according to a  report by investment bankers brown gibbons lang  company dermatology practices continue to attract private equity interest and outside capital investment beginning with audax group’s october  recapitalization of advanced dermatology and cosmetic surgery six dermatology platform investments have been made by private equity sponsors over the past year the number of new funds seeking an investment in dermatology has grown dramatically existing platforms have continued to expand and a number of sponsors have tapped operating executives to build platforms investment activity has expanded outside traditional dermatology hotbeds such as florida and the southwest with acquisitions in the midwest and great plains fueled by a strong capital markets environment and a sense of urgency for funds to deploy capital numerous factors contribute to the attractiveness of dermatology practices as investment platforms dermatology remains a highly fragmented market and the multisite multiunit structure of group practices is ideal for pursuing buy and build strategies elective cash pay ancillary services in cosmetic dermatology allow for directtoconsumer marketing while medical dermatology provides a solid foundation for recurring cash flows practice branding lends well to physician transition unlike other medical specialties where the practice goodwill resides predominantly with the physicians scale is key not only in terms of geographic reach but also number of providers achieving a certain level of scale affords the ability to bring pathology lab services inhouse and provide additional ancillary services and products  care and case management more interest entities that provide case management services  have drawn small but increasing interest from investors looking to get in early on evolving and preventivefocused care delivery and payment models separately certain pe firms like summit partners have invested heavily in large groups such as health partners and dupage medical group  private equity firms could be betting longterm on the ability to sell these managedcaresavvy medical groups to insurers or health systems which may pay a premium for practices that can prove carecoordination and analytics expertise primary care groups that can demonstrate better quality care and lower costs in managing complex patients will be valuable in a healthcare system that rewards costeffective care  according to modern healthcare there were  deals involving providers in the first quarter of  that is a  percent increase from q  and a total of  billion in ma activity private equity groups increased their activity in the healthcare market with  healthcare deals in q  including  in the provider space by comparison private equity groups made just  total deals in all  with  in the provider space for example in march new yorkbased privateequity firm harbour point capital invested in oak street health a chicagobased network of seven primary care clinics that focuses on coordinating care for traditional medicare and medicare advantage plans according to oak street health ceo mike pykosz the group was courted by about  firms according to mr cockrell “this sector has created some very smart business models these models include saturating the population with heavy doses of primary care to manage andor avoid chronic conditions”  accountable care organizations and population health back office services more interest with the growing number of acos in the us a great deal of companies — small midsized and large — have developed around providing services to acos see “ things to know about acos” becker’s hospital review july  valence health in chicago — a provider of valuebased care solutions — helps hospitals health systems and physicians switch to valuebased care models by providing software consulting data aggregation and other services in june valence was chosen by centegra health  wellness network — an association of primary care physicians and specialists — to support its clinically integrated network there are other companies that provide more focused services to ipas physicianhospital organizations and acos for example optum a division of unitedhealthcare focuses on information and technology enabled health services according to mr cockrell theres more private equity funds looking for ways to invest and get involved with valuebased industry change more funds are looking at ways to take on risk and become a risktaker in the sector and weve seen private equity funds buying up large primary care practices and taking a stake in organizations with capitated or riskbased contracts   for instance last year private equity firm great point partners helped bankroll the merger of orange health solutions and mzi healthcare orange health founded by former unitedhealth group executives provide services to hospitals and healthcare organizations to help establish valuebased care models and acos mzi helps providers health plans acos and other healthcare entities with data analytics predictive modeling medical care management and health benefit management technologies arcadia healthcare solutions an ehr data aggregation and analytics company acquired managed services and aco implementation provider sage technologies giving arcadia endtoend exposure in the managed care sector the acquisition was bankrolled by peloton equity morgan stanley alternative investment partners zaffre investments and escalate capital partners  anesthesia practice management equal to more interest during the last few years there has been an evolution in the number of anesthesia practice management companies in the country these companies serve both major hospital systems and a number of smaller companies that provide services on a regional basis or to physiciandriven ambulatory surgery centers for instance sheridan healthcare sold to amsurg in  for  billion private equity groups such as madisondearborn partners llc blackstone group lp and goldman sachs private capital investing group have invested significantly in anesthesia practices knoxville tennbased teamhealth anesthesia is one of the leaders in outsourced anesthesia and pain management the physicianled company has what is nearly the largest bench of specialists in the country delivering hospitalbased services its physicians provide anesthesia services in community hospitals major medical centers and teaching facilities small private anesthesiology firms feeling the pressure of reduced reimbursement rates from large insurers are welcoming acquisition deals with bigtime suitors like mednax teamhealth and amsurg corp  according to mr becker there has been tremendous consolidation and activity here from existing firms and those like amsurg that have broken into this area  due to good profits and active deal flow it continues to draw serious private equity interest it seems like there is still a lot of consolidation to be done   revenue cycle management equal to more interest financial buyers have made a strong showing in the revenue cycle management sector as evidenced by the spike in mergers and acquisitions last year the market for revenue cycle companies saw  transactions in  with more than  billion exchanging hands according to a report from greenberg advisors investments in revenue cycle management software and services over the coming years are expected to increase by upwards of  percent globally the total spend on rcm solutions is projected to surpass  billion by  a well run revenue cycle can make or break the success of a health system therefore the value of revenue cycle service providers in the industry is unquestioned mr cockrell says there are a wide array of generalist private equity funds that would like to gain exposure in healthcare markets but dont want to take on direct reimbursement risk revenue cycle companies present a great opportunity for these funds to make a solid investment without taking on risks they arent prepared for moreover the number of revenue cycle management companies focused on the outsourcing of billing and collections continues to increase black book projects the market for outsourced revenue cycle management will grow at a compound annual growth rate of  percent through   some notable private equity deals in the rcm sector last year included thoma bravos purchase of medeanalytics arlington capital partners acquisition of ontario systems for which nxt capital supplied  million and edgewater growth capital partners portfolio boulder healthcare solutions acquisition of the roi companies  rcm vendors have also been snapping up smaller players to shore up their endtoend service offerings for instance last year rcmprovider emdeon acquired both altegra health and capario to expand its revenue cycle capabilities the emdeonaltegra deal was valued at  million in the first quarter of  pamplona capital management closed its acquisition of medassets for  billion the transaction is one of what the company expects to be a series of acquisitions aimed at creating a single company capable of replacing the patchwork of vendors hospitals typically use for billing in january pamplona made a strategic investment in patientco another technology vendor that provides payment services to the healthcare market  specialty pharmacy equal to less interest there continues to be great interest in the development and funding of specialty pharmacy distribution companies as well as companies that focus on the actual development of pharmaceuticals for example hepatitis c pill sovaldi posted  billion in sales for the second quarter of  which puts foster city califbased gilead sciences the maker of the drug on track to become one of the topselling pharmaceutical companies in addition healthcarefocused private equity firm belhealth investment partners sold aureus health services a leading provider of specialty pharmacy services to national grocer meijer according to bain the generic pharmaceutical producer segment drew significant private equity interest in  in  cvc capital partners teamed up with temasek in a  billion deal to buy generic drug firm alvogen from pamplona capital management while its peer cinven sold its own generic pharma group amco to concordia healthcare for  billion one driver of the private equity interest in this segment is that investors face less competition from potential strategic buyers than in other healthcare segments in the us generics manufacturers face revenue dips similar to the patent cliffs faced by their branded pharmaceutical counterparts when their postpatent exclusivity periods end this volatility in revenue streams makes them less attractive to publicly traded strategic buyers  pain management equal to more interest there continues to be a substantial increase in interest in pain management clinics nearly  million americans suffer from acute and chronic pain nearly a billion is spent each year on pain management and a large amount of dollars is spent each year on treatment a good deal of pain management profits are also derived through ancillary services such as ascs and lab tests there has been a tremendous increase in investment interest in the pain management sector during the last several years this is driven by the core pain business and revenues from ancillary services — such as lab testing and ambulatory surgery centers — divided by pain management physicians activity in this space since  includes chicago growth partners’ acquisition of advanced pain management sentinel capital partner’s investment in national spine  pain centers and the  formation of prospira paincare which was created with the backing of three private equity firms and has acquired pain centers across the country in  pain doctor a leading pain management company providing standardized care and high quality service received a significant growth capital investment by catterton partners the leading consumerfocused private equity firm the investments intention was to expand pain doctors reach across the us and build its support businesses which include lead generation lab services and natural pain relief supplements   copyright asc communications
