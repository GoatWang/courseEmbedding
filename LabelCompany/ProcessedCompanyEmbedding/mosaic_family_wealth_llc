about challenges they’ve faced in the market—how the downturn of  shook their confidence as investors or how a “sure thing” suddenly become anything butour response is to listen to empathize and to educate the truth is that the markets will always be unpredictable losses and gains will happen and are largely out of anyone’s control in fact vast amounts of academic research have proven time and again that there is virtually no way of predicting when significant market events will occur“timing perseverance and  years of trying will eventually make youlook like an overnight success” — biz stoneinstead of focusing on what we can’t control we help you focus on what you can yourself our investment philosophy is grounded in the study of human behavior so you can better understand your own actions and reactions to market forces in this way we help you see that it’s better to be generally correct as an investor with a longterm focus than to be precisely wrong by focusing solely on the short term the behavior gap   ﻿ mosaic family wealth llc sells  shares of emerson electric company emr  chaffey breeze daily ratings  news for emerson electric company complete the form below to
