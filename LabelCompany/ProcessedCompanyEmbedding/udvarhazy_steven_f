publications such was the case however with the national air and space museums newest facility the steven f udvarhazy center at dulles international airport outside washington dc to characterize the udvarhazy center as imposing is to do it a disservice it is immense more than ten stories high about three football fields long and will ultimately enclose  square feet inspired by a dirigible hangar and evoking an actual airport with its foottall observation tower named in honor of donald engen former nasm director and a tireless advocate for this new museum udvarhazy inspires its visitors even before they walk through its doors a twothousandspace parking lot directly in front of the museum provides easy access after the nowfamiliar security check we passed by visitor services and were immediately drawn to the entrance of the large gallery you dont have to be an aviation or space enthusiast to appreciate the marvelous panorama of aircraft that seems to float all around you in the main display area there were groups of seniors moms and dads with strollers and children a group of professional women people of all nationalities speaking many different languages—all walking around doing their own thing and looking happy about it there were visitors discussing the dynamics of engine power and airworthiness while others excitedly exclaimed look at that yellow one this confirmed what i already knew that enthusiasm for and interest in aviation and space runs the gamut of interests knowledge age and experience this is one of the reasons that the national air and space museum on

center was named for steven udvarhazy founder and chief executive of the international lease finance corporation who contributed an unbelievable sixtyfive million dollars to the center whose total cost it is estimated will reach  million the building was designed by the firm of hellmuth obata and kassabaum which also designed the flagship national air and space museum building its arched trusses and network of walkways and bridges give visitors eyelevel views of hanging aircraft at two levels as well as from the floor airplanes are hung as though in the middle of typical flight maneuvers in contrast to the display positions at most aviation museums and the effect is dynamic and exciting the aircraft steal the show here the udvarhazy center currently displays about eighty aircraft and over sixtyfive spacecraft as you walk around you notice plenty of room for future additions when all two hundred aircraft and more than  large space artifacts are installed along with a huge array of smaller artifacts visitors will likely have to make a day of it if not two our legs gave out before our interest did note that the floor is concrete and very hard on the feet so wear
