through fertilization are nitrogen phosphate and potash cf specializes in nitrogen which is primarily used to fertilize corn and is not necessary for the second largest crop soybeans in the past three years corn crop revenue has exceeded  billion compared to less than  billion just  years ago on the heels of high corn prices cf industries has benefited greatly from this prosperous corn crop and they have recorded record gross margins and earnings per share during this period corn has now fallen  from yearago prices and ammonia fertilizer prices a reference price for nitrogenbased fertilizers has fallen roughly  in the past year cf industries stock price however is near an alltime high it seems that the current investor base is more focused on potential capital opportunities the company may pursue and less focused on the underlying economic prospects for the nitrogen business bluepac partners believes given current fertilizer prices and commodity prices that earnings estimates for cf

bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
