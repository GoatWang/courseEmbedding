studies conducted by investigators from the university of california in san diego mobley laboratory and los angeles john laboratory characterizing the effects of posiphen in healthy versus diseased down syndrome cells and mice down syndrome has a triplication of chromosome  and chromosome  contains the app gene triplication of the app gene results in high levels of app posiphen lowers the levels

observed development of alzheimers disease in adults with down syndrome has been an area of increased study as the life expectancy of adults with down syndrome has extended the data generated in these studies demonstrates posiphens ability to downregulate elevated app levels in well understood in vitro and in vivo disease models of down syndrome noted richard fitzgerald qr pharmas chief financial officer    the data suggests that posiphen should be tested in a preventive setting in down syndrome individuals as they carry a substantial risk of early onset of alzheimers disease stated dr

treatment with posiphen® normalized csf levels of sapp and tau and reduced αsyn and a series of inflammatory markers pk of posiphen in brain suggest that doses of  to  mg once a day could achieve

normal volunteers with an overall incidence of  among placebotreated subjects and  for all posiphen® treatment groups combined in the single ascending dose study the group given the highest dose of  mgday showed  aes that were treatmentrelated in the multiple ascending dose and in the moa study there was no dose response to the adverse events most aes were of short duration mild or moderate in severity resolved without medical intervention and occurred in one or a few subjects only two subjects experienced severe aes including symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension  placebo and  posiphen® mg subject the human poc study  patients with mild cognitive impairment were treated for  days with posiphen® with the safe dose of × mg  mgday csf and plasma were drawn over  hours on day  and day  levels of posiphen® and metabolites were measured in plasma and csf over the  hours posiphen® pk in plasma corresponded to what the company had seen in the previous clinical safety studies t   hrs in csf however posiphen® showed a much longer halflife of t   hours qr conducted an identical experiment in rats where it is possible to measure the pk of posiphen® in plasma csf and brain by taking the human plasmacsf and rat plasmacsfbrain levels qr was able to extrapolate to the human brain levels and calculate them to be eight times higher than plasma levels this is consistent with the data the company has in mice where in a number of studies posiphen® levels were found to be  times higher in brain than in plasma posiphen®’s extended presence in the brain is matched by an extended effect reducing levels of αsyn sapp and tau for the whole period tested over  hours the extended effect of posiphen® in humans was consistent with the preclinical data in rodent brains the persistence of posiphen® in the csf and brain and the extended pharmacodynamic effect observed make posiphen® a good candidate for qd dosing extrapolated brain levels of posiphen® at  mg qid were far in excess of levels required to downregulate app and αsyn the regulation of translation across the toxic aggregating proteins is similarly responsive to posiphen® suggesting similar dosing in ad pd and hd qr further compared posiphen® brain levels of mice that showed full reversal of their ad or pd behavior and calculated that the optimum brain levels to achieve full efficacy are between  and  nm using three different extrapolationcomparison calculations the company deduced that a daily dose of  mg should achieve desired brain levels and efficacy mci patients treated for  days and extracted csf for  hours before and after the last administration of posiphen® show about  lower levels of aggregating toxic proteins the levels measured have dropped to levels found in healthy normal volunteers mci patients also show high levels of inflammatory factors and microglia activation factors in their csf posiphen® significantly lowered the levels of a number of inflammation factors in their csf new phase iia study in alzheimer patients in collaboration with adcs alzheimer’s disease cooperative study qr is starting a phase iia study in mild to moderate alzheimer’s patients × alzheimer patients

of the study and a  hour spinal fluid collection at the end for the cognitive outcome they will be tested at the beginning and the day before the  hr spinal fluid collection at the end the protocol has been signed and was sent to the irbs and to the fda the treatment of the first patient is scheduled for june  while alzheimer’s disease is the most common disease among the elderly and the most

events most aes were of short duration mild or moderate in severity resolved without medical intervention and occurred in one or a few subjects only two subjects experienced severe aes including symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension  placebo and  posiphen® mg subject the human poc study  patients with mild cognitive impairment were treated for  days with posiphen® with the safe dose of × mg  mgday csf and plasma were drawn over  hours on day  and day  levels of posiphen® and metabolites were measured in plasma and csf over the  hours posiphen® pk in plasma corresponded to what the company had seen in the previous clinical safety studies t   hrs in csf however posiphen® showed a much longer halflife of t   hours qr conducted an identical experiment in rats where it is possible to measure the pk of posiphen® in plasma csf and brain by taking the human plasmacsf and rat plasmacsfbrain levels qr was able to extrapolate to the human brain levels and calculate them to be eight times higher than plasma levels this is consistent with the data the company has in mice where in a number of studies posiphen® levels were found to be  times higher in brain than in plasma posiphen®’s extended presence in the brain is matched by an extended effect reducing levels of αsyn sapp and tau for the whole period tested over  hours the extended effect of posiphen® in humans was consistent with the preclinical data in rodent brains the persistence of posiphen® in the csf and brain and the extended pharmacodynamic effect observed make posiphen® a good candidate for qd dosing extrapolated brain levels of posiphen® at  mg qid were far in excess of levels required to downregulate app and αsyn the regulation of translation across the toxic aggregating proteins is similarly responsive to posiphen® suggesting similar dosing in ad pd and hd qr further compared posiphen® brain levels of mice that showed full reversal of their ad or pd behavior and calculated that the optimum brain levels to achieve full efficacy are between  and  nm using three different extrapolationcomparison calculations the company deduced that a daily dose of  mg should achieve desired brain levels and efficacy mci patients treated for  days and extracted csf for  hours before and after the last administration of posiphen® show about  lower levels of aggregating toxic proteins the levels measured have dropped to levels found in healthy normal volunteers mci patients also show high levels of inflammatory factors and microglia activation factors in their csf posiphen® significantly lowered the levels of a number of inflammation factors in their csf new phase iia study in alzheimer patients in collaboration with adcs alzheimer’s disease cooperative study qr is starting a phase iia study in mild to moderate alzheimer’s patients × alzheimer patients are to be treated for one month with  doses of posiphen® and placebo the endpoints are app and abeta levels in spinal fluid other biomarkers in spinal fluid inflammatory markers in spinal fluid silk stable isotope labeling kinetics in spinal fluid with synthesis and degradation rates cognition and safety in order to obtain all the above endpoints patients will have one spinal tab at the beginning of the study and a  hour spinal fluid collection at the end for the cognitive outcome they will be tested at the beginning and the day before the  hr spinal fluid collection at the end the protocol has been signed and was sent to the irbs and to the fda the treatment of the first patient is scheduled for june  while alzheimer’s disease is the most common disease among the elderly and the most lucrative market the large body of preclinical data accumulated to date opens the potential of wider applicability of posiphen® in other neurodegenerative disorders aggregating proteins measured in the csf of mci patients in the moa study described above posiphen® given for  days normalizes app and tau scroll to top
