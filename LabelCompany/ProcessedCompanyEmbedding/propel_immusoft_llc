tickets here immusoft ceo matthew scholz immusoft a seattlebased biotech startup that has developed a way to manipulate human immune cells today announced the acquisition of discovery genomics a yearold company based in minneapolis minn immusoft ceo matthew scholz said that his company acquired discovery genomics to gain its scientific expertise and key technology called the sleeping beauty transposon system which is used to deliver genes into cells to prevent or alleviate a disease state all without using a virus “our two companies share a culture of innovation and a desire to change the way many diseases can be treated” scholz said in a statement “it is my hope and expectation that combining our expertise and technology will help us in this pursuit” immusoft will use discovery genomics’ innovations to compliment its own technology which essentially reprograms a patient’s b cells — the ones that make diseasefighting antibodies — and then manipulates the genetic code so the cells can be put back into the body and attack diseases like hiv “basically we turn patient cells into drug factories” scholz told geekwire in  “instead of making treatments and injecting them we take the cell out program them to make treatment and put them back into your own body” scholz founded immusoft in  and has raised nearly  million from angel investors grants and other organizations for the company which employs five immusoft has several treatments in its pipeline but all are still in developmental phase discovery genomics’ three employees will remain in minneapolis geekwire
