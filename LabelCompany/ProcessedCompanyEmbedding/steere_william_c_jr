during his tenure as pfizer ceo published march   am  by lee howard day staff writer william c steere jr longtime board member for pfizer inc and chief executive of the firm during its heyday in the s will be leaving his position as one of the companys directors in a move that some see as reaffirmation of a major shakeup playing out at the pharmaceutical giantthe yearold steeres retirement from the board announced unceremoniously in a footnote to a proxy filed by pfizer earlier this week will take effect next month after the companys annual meeting another director robert n burt former chairman and chief executive of chemicals manufacturer fmc corp and machinery manufacturer fmc technologies inc will be retiring at the same timebut it was steeres retirement that caught the eye of many industry watchers including ed silverman who writes the influential pharmalot blog and broke the story steere served as pfizer chief executive from  to  and as chairman from  to  during a time when pfizer brought to market such leading medications as viagra zoloft and zithromaxhis departure signals the end of an era given the domineering role he sometimes played notably a push for outsized acquisitions silverman saidsteere initially an opponent of major acquisitions eventually became an adherent of the strategy turning pfizer into a virtual companyeating machine including megamergers with warnerlambert pharmacia and wyeth pharmaceuticals pfizer has major research facilities in groton and new londonthe warnerlambert deal brought pfizer the worlds leading medication cholesterol drug lipitor but subsequent acquisitions werent as successful the wyeth merger according to silverman led to a rift between steere and former chief executive jeffrey b kindler who had preferred a diversification strategy and may have resulted in kindlers ouster at the end of last yearpfizers current chief executive ian read said to be a steere loyalist nevertheless has begun reconsidering some of the chairman emeritus strategies in the past month read has signaled his intention to seriously look into selling off parts of the company including animal health and consumer product divisions that largely are the legacy of the wyeth acquisitionat least symbolically steeres departure could mean that ian read  has a free hand according to matthew herper in his blog the medicine showon the other hand according to silverman pfizers new chairman of the board yearold george lorch is considered a steere protege and they regularly play golf togethersteere will continue to cast a shadow over
