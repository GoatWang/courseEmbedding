treesnake control on guamproduct type journal articleyear authors lardner b aa yackel adams ja savidge gh rodda rn reed and cs clarksuggested citation lardner b aa yackel adams ja savidge gh rodda rn reed and cs clark  effectiveness of bait tubes for brown treesnake control on guam wildlife society bulletin  – in  we studied simulated toxicant efficacy to control invasive brown treesnakes boiga irregularis using bait tubes elongate bait stations that reduce nontarget bait take in a ha enclosure in guam us territory with a known population of snakes instead of toxicants we implanted radiotransmitters in small  ±  g and large  ±  g baitmouse carcasses offered from  types of bait tubes over a month period the known snake population allowed us to characterize not only the snakes taking bait but also those evading our mock control effort tube design had no effect on take rate but snout–vent length was a strong predictor of bait take none of the  snakes  mm in length took any bait whereas  of the  snakes  mm in length took  baits while mediumsized snakes preferentially ingested small bait and the largest snakes tended to take large mice more frequently some of the smallest snakes that took bait ingested large mice snake body condition was positively correlated to take rate but snake sex had no discernible effect our data show that there is a relatively narrow size and thus time gap between the size at which the snakes become susceptible to baitmouse take and the size at which they become sexually mature this has implications for the timing of repeated baiting efforts if the goal is eradication rather than suppression related projects title completion year investigator control and containment of the brown treesnake and other invasive reptiles  bob reed see
