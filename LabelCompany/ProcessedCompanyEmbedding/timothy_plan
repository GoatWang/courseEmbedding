faithbased community pushes investment pioneer timothy plan over usd b  days ago  prn orlando fla july    timothy partners ltd manager and adviser of timothy plan announced on thursday july th that the family of funds has eclipsed usd  billion in assets under management aum this is a milestone moment for any packaged investment product but for the family of mutual funds that started an entire movement it is particularly speciali didnt allow myself to dream about reaching milestones like this when we launched in  the purpose of timothy plan is to provide christian and principled investors the opportunity to earn competitive returns while aligning their investments with the biblical principles in which they believe said arthur ally president of timothy partners ltd and founder of timothy plan the first of its kind timothy plan was started in  when art ally then a financial advisor was tasked with starting a retirement plan for nondenominational pastors what he experienced when undertaking that task shocked the financial veterani couldnt find any funds or investment products that employed biblical screens of the companies in which they invest we had pastors preaching on sundays about how we need to stand against the increasing number of abortions or the infiltration of pornographic material into our society but then were funding their retirement plans with the stocks of companies that were directly supporting these two industries when i showed this to them they were shockedtimothy plan screens all their investments to make certain that the companies in which they invest do not have ties to anything contrary to a traditional conservative interpretation of biblical principles at the time of launch there were no other funds or investment vehicles that comprehensively screened their investments for religious principles now there are other faith funds green funds and socially responsible funds there are even sin funds that stand in direct contrast to the purpose of timothy plan while other funds have been quicker to reach the  billion watermark timothy plan has weathered the storm of the recession and was built upon its own success without the backing of a mainline church denomination there may be other funds that screen and i am glad that we started a movement to align investments with belief but none of that matters if a persons heart isnt right with god what i can promise is that timothy plan will never compromise on its original mission and i believe that is what god asks of us today is not about timothy plan nor is any other day today is about realizing the amazing things that can happen when individuals are willing to change an aspect of their lives to further the kingdom of god  arthur ally president  founder timothy

donovan updated july   since  the timothy plan has attempted to avoid investing in companies that are involved in practices they consider contrary to judeochristian principles performing what they call biblically responsible investingthe fund at its website lists defunding planned parenthood as a clear targeted outcome linking the organization with more recent efforts in the republican led us congress  they have previously found  companies directly funding planned parenthood through their evalueator tool making them a clear modern day example of a fund with religious values performing a form of negative screening historygoing back to  the timothy plan family of funds promoted itself as “america’s first prolife profamily biblicallybased mutual fund group” it avoided investing in companies it saw as contributing to the country’s “moral decline” meaning those involved in abortion pornography antifamily entertainment nonmarried lifestyles alcohol tobacco and gamblingthe funds were founded in  by arthur ally a former lehman brothers vice president who wanted to address an investment need for the retirement plans of pastors of independent churches while there were funds available that screened for social or environmental issues there weren’t any that screened according to the moral or culturally conservative principles of the pastors“they would preach on the evils of abortion or pornography and art didn’t have a choice but to put them in a retirement plan that invested in companies that were in direct opposition to what they believed” says steven ally marketing director for the timothy funds arthur ally started the first fund in  and the timothy plan today includes  funds the firm has created a “hall of shame” of companies now called know your investing that operate contrary to the firm’s investing principles and are excluded from investments steven ally says that aside from the moral screens the funds aim to preserve capital and the match or beat their respective benchmarks for all of societys ills listed in timothy plans know your investing analysis climate change and inequality does not feature  this makes their approach divergent from that of pope francis call to action on climate change and so different strands of religious investing are now starting to emergeseparate again would be sharia investing with its roots in shared value and shared ownership shunning interest as a taboo practicereligiously mandated funds therefore need to be understood not only for the branch of the religion you are trying to match up to but also as to

ltd advisor is registered with the securities and exchange commission as an investment advisor under the investment advisers act of  as amended advisers act pursuant to an advisory agreement between advisor and the timothy plan the trust advisor manages the assets of the timothy plan funds the funds as the investment adviser to the funds advisor is responsible for voting all proxies related to securities held in the funds investment portfolios because the fund subadvisors under the close scrutiny of the advisor perform economic and management analyses of the companies in which the funds are invested advisor looks to the fund subadvisors to vote proxies and each subadvisors proxy policies and procedures are incorporated herein by specific reference advisor consistent with its fiduciary duties and pursuant to rule  under the advisers act has designed this proxy voting policy the policy to reflect its commitment to vote all proxies when called upon to vote by a subadvisor who perceives a potential conflict or for any other reason in a manner consistent with the best interests of the funds shareholders subadvisors and advisor consistent with their duty of care will monitor corporate actions for those issuers whose securities are called upon to vote consistent with its duty of loyalty advisor will in all cases vote or cause subadvisors to vote to promote the funds shareholders best interests in determining how to vote proxies advisor and subadvisors shall initially review each proxy subject to an analysis of the impact each issue may have pursuant to the moral considerations set forth in the prospectus and shall vote in a manner not inconsistent with those moral considerations further advisor and subadvisors will not subordinate the economic interest of the funds shareholders to their own interests or to that of any other entity or interested party key proxy voting issues all votes shall initially be reviewed subject to an analysis of the impact each issue may have pursuant to the moral considerations set forth in the prospectus subsequent to the moral analysis all votes shall be on a companybycompany basis and each issue shall be considered in the context of the company under review and the various economic impacts such issues may have on the funds stated investment objectives advisor will give great weight to the views of management if and only if the issues involved will not have a negative impact on funds shareholder values in all other cases advisor will engage in an independent analysis of the impact that the proposed action will have on shareholder values  board of directors electing directors is one of the most important rights of stock ownership that company shareholders can exercise advisor believes that company directors should act in the longterm interests of the companys shareholders and the company as a whole generally subsequent to the moral considerations addressed above when called upon by a subadvisor to vote advisor will vote in favor of director nominees that have expressed andor demonstrated a commitment to the interest of the companys shareholders advisor will consider the following factors in deciding how to vote proxies relating to director elections in reelecting incumbent directors the longterm performance of the company relative to its peers – advisor will not vote to reelect a board if the company has had consistent poor performance relative to its peers in the industry unless the board has taken or is attempting to take steps to improve the companys performance whether the slate of director nominees promotes a majority of independent directors on the full board – advisor believes that it is in the best interest of all company shareholders to have as a majority directors that are independent of management a director nominees attendance at less than  of required meetings – frequent nonattendance at board meetings will be grounds for voting against reelection existence of any prior sec violations andor other criminal offenses – advisor will not vote in favor of a director nominee who to advisors actual knowledge is the subject of sec or other criminal enforcement actions advisor believes that it is in the shareholders best interests to have bright and experienced directors serving on a companys board to this end advisor believes that companies should be allowed to establish director compensation packages that attract and retain desirable directors advisor will consider whether proposals relating to director compensation are reasonable in relation to the companys performance and resources advisor will vote in favor of proposals that seek to impose reasonable limits on director compensation in all other issues that may arise relating to the board of directors advisor will vote against all proposals that benefit directors at the expense of shareholders and in favor of all proposals that do not unreasonably abrogate the rights of shareholders as previously stated each issue will be analyzed on an issuebyissue basis  corporate governance corporate governance issues may include but are not limited to the following i corporate defenses ii corporate restructuring proposals iii proposals affecting the capital structure of a company iv proposals regarding executive compensation or v proposals regarding the independent auditors of the company when called upon by a subadvisor to vote i corporate defenses although advisor will review each proposal on a casebycase basis advisor will generally vote against management proposals that a seek to insulate management from all threats of change in control b provide the board with veto power against all takeover bids c allow management or the board of the company to buy shares from particular shareholders at a premium at the expense of the majority of shareholders or d allow management to increase or decrease the size of the board at its own discretion advisor will only vote in favor of those proposals that do not unreasonably discriminate against a majority of shareholders or greatly alter the balance of power between shareholders on one side and management and the board on the other ii corporate restructuring these may include mergers and acquisitions spinoffs asset sales leveraged buyouts andor liquidations in determining the vote on these types of proposals advisor will consider the following factors a whether the proposed action represents the best means of enhancing shareholder values b whether the companys longterm prospects will be positively affected by the proposal c how the proposed action will impact corporate governance andor shareholder rights d how the proposed deal was negotiated e whether all shareholders receive equalfair treatment under the terms of the proposed action andor f whether shareholders could realize greater value through alternative means iii capital structure proposals affecting the capital structure of a company may have significant impact on shareholder value particularly when they involve the issuance of additional stock as such advisor will vote in favor of proposals to increase the authorized or outstanding stock of the company only when management provides persuasive business justification for the increase such as to fund acquisitions recapitalization or debt restructuring advisor will vote against proposals that unreasonably dilute shareholder value or create classes of stock with unequal voting rights if over time such action may lead to a concentration of voting power in the hands of few insiders iv executive compensation advisor believes executives should be compensated at a reasonable rate and that companies should be free to offer attractive compensation packages that encourage high performance in executives because over time it will increase shareholder values advisor also believes however that executive compensation should to some extent be tied to the performance of the company therefore advisor will vote in favor of proposals that provide challenging performance objectives to company executives and which serve to motivate executives to better performance advisor will vote against all proposals that offer unreasonable benefits to executives whose past performance has been less than satisfactory advisor will vote against shareholder proposals that summarily restrict executive compensation without regard to the companys performance and in favor of shareholder proposals that seek additional disclosures on executive compensation v independent auditors the engagement retention and termination of a companys independent auditors must be approved by the companys audit committee which typically includes only those independent directors who are not affiliated with or compensated by the company except for directors fees in reliance on the audit committees recommendation advisor generally will vote to ratify the employment or retention of a companys independent auditors unless advisor is aware that the auditor is not independent or that the auditor has in the past rendered an opinion that was neither accurate nor indicative of the companys financial position  shareholder rights state law provides shareholders of a company with various rights including but not limited to cumulative voting appraisal rights the ability to call special meetings the ability to vote by written consent and the ability to amend the charter or bylaws of the company when called upon by a subadvisor to vote advisor will carefully analyze all proposals relating to shareholder rights and will vote against proposals that seek to eliminate existing shareholder rights or restrict the ability of shareholders to act in a reasonable manner to protect their interest in the company in all cases advisor will vote in favor of proposals that best represent the longterm financial interest of fund shareholders  social and environmental issues when called upon by a subadvisor to vote in determining how to vote proxies in this category advisor will consider the following factors whether the proposal creates a stated position that could affect the companys reputation andor operations or leave it vulnerable to boycotts and other negative consumer responses the percentage of assets of the company that will be devoted to implementing the proposal whether the issue is more properly dealt with through other means such as through governmental action whether the company has already dealt with the issue in some other appropriate way and what other companies have done in response to the issue while advisor generally supports shareholder proposals that seek to create good corporate citizenship advisor will vote against proposals that would tie up a large percentage of the assets of the company advisor believes that such proposals are inconsistent with its duty to seek longterm value for fund shareholders advisor will also evaluate all proposals seeking to bring to an end certain corporate actions to determine whether the proposals adversely affect the ability of the company to remain profitable advisor will vote in favor of proposals that enhance or do not negatively impact longterm shareholder values proxy voting procedures  the proxy voting officer advisor hereby appoints terry covert as the person responsible
