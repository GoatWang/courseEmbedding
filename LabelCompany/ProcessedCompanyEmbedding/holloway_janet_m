influence corporations and industry groups labor unions singleissue organizations  together they spend billions of dollars each year to gain access to decisionmakers in government all in an attempt to influence their thinking influence  lobbying industries lobbying revolving door pacs organizations s find your representatives use these resources in opensecretsorgs influence  lobbying section which are also found at the left to learn more about washingtons influence industry and its most powerful players interest groups just about any interest group you can think of has a presence in washingtonand spends money to maintain that presence here weve totaled all the campaign contributions over the years from more than  interest groups so that you can see patterns that might have affected policies with an impact on your life we also track how much interest groups have been spending on lobbying which is the other side of the influence coin lobbying professional advocates make big bucks to lobby members of congress and government officials on the issues their clients care about but the money that industries companies unions and issue groups spend on lobbying is often just a drop in the bucket compared to what they can reap in return if their lobbyists are successful here you can see who spends what on federal lobbying and where they focus their resources revolving door youve heard it before  its not what you know its who you know in our nations capital success comes with a combination of knowledge and personal connections this database tracks thousands of individuals whove spun through washingtons revolving door employing professional relationships and knowhow accumulated through public service to advance the goals of their private employers pacs in a campaign finance system where all the money originates from individuals political action committees or pacs control the most corporate of money controlled by companies trade associations unions issue groups and even politicians a subset called leadership pacs these committees pool contributions from individuals and distribute them to candidates political parties and other pacs pacs can also spend money independently on political activities including advertising and other efforts to support or oppose candidates in an election organizations influence in washington is created from many ingredients here we give you ataglance profiles of the political donations outside spending and lobbying expenditures of more than  labor unions corporations and trade groups as well as the number of lawmakers who have personally invested in them more detailed profiles are available for the  or so biggest alltime contributors since  s for the longest time campaign ads were almost exclusively produced by candidates and political parties but in recent years outside issue groups have been getting in on the action they often operate as socalled  committees taking their name from the relevant section of the irs tax code sometimes mysteriously named these advocacy groups frequently have ties to labor big business and superwealthy individuals unlike political committees they can accept unlimited contributions from just about anyone and they deploy that money in various ways to influence elections keep an eye on these shadowy groups here count cash  make change sign up for our
