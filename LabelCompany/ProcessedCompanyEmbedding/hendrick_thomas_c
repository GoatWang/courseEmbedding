ancestrycom kith  kin mckinzie blythe branch  bartlett   from the files of robert w baird hance or hans hendrick appears to have arrived in virginia in the early or mid s as hance hendrick he received a headright patent dated  april  for  acres in pamunkey neck of king and queen county virginia the patent was for transportation of himself his wife jane and ten others the land was bounded by the mattapony river fox trap branch and deep bottom branch and adjoined the land of william morris the ridge road by the schoole house and fox trapp bridge the land description shows he owned land in the area earlier as the grant refers to the old corner between hance hendrick and john oakes   a second patent of  nearby acres for the transportation of four persons was recorded on  october  although no county is mentioned in the patent the land was on the mattapony river and appears to adjoin the earlier patent which by this time was in newlyformed king william county the land description refers to a corner white oake in sight of hances old plantation again suggesting a missing earlier land entry the  quit rents of virginia list hans hendrick with  acres subject to quit rent in king william county he is the only hendrick in virginia   these two patents clearly refer to the presence of hance hendrick earlier than  an explanation exists but requires a brief digression the pamunkey neck was originally indian land in which white settlement was forbidden by a  treaty with the pamunkey king that didnt stop settlers from occupying the land nor did it stop the indians from retaliating bacons rebellion of  was partly an attempt to defend these settlers from indian attacks eventually the pamunkey indians leased land to a few whites who then sold their rights in smaller parcels to other settlers since the colony received no income from these lands a committee formed in  looked into the question of land grants in pamunkey neck it reported ralph yarborough an indian interpreter and trader to be among those who held a year lease with the pamunkeys this lease was evidently obtained in  the committee also reported that thomas hendrick claimed  acres purchased from yarborough and john ascough it is uncertain when this land was sold to hendrick only that he claimed a right to it in  the governor recognized this title this same committee recommended and the governor implemented in  the acquisition of land by treasury right as an alternative to acquisition by headrights for five shillings per  acres any english subject could acquire new land all land however acquired was subject to the annual quit rents it seems highly likely that thomas hendrick and hance hendrick were the same person whether thomas was an error in transcription by des cognets or whether his name was in the dutch style thomas hans hendrick is unclear in either event analysis of other early patents to yarboroughs assignees makes it clear that the land of thomas hendrick was the same land described in the   and  patents as hance hendricks old plantation in addition william morriss land adjoined both hance hendrick and ralph yarborough william hurt who had patented land in new kent as early as  was another assignee and had had settled on land next to hance hendrick by  his son john hurt purchased land in the neck in  suggesting the father had been there several years earlier   when hance hendrick arrived in virginia and from where is unclear headrights were unrestricted with regard to the place of origin  that is he could have come into virginia from any of the other colonies as well as from europe the fact that he did not claim any children among his sixteen headrights suggests that all his children were born subsequent to his arrival in virginia and we have evidence that at least one child was born by about  he is unlikely to have arrived in virginia before june  since naturalization before that date required an act of the assembly and no hendrick naturalization is noted in hennings statutes after june  naturalization was handled by the governor and would have been recorded elsewhere usually in the orders of council which are mostly incomplete he was clearly a british citizen by  when his claim was recognized by the governor as foreigners who had not taken the oath were not permitted to own land there are two possibilities he may have immigrated from britain or holland  the name suggests he was dutch but plenty of people named hendrick were also living in england in the early s the second possibility is that he immigrated from one of the colonies north of virginia ralph yarborough apparently promoted his land in both britain and new york and perhaps elsewhere hence hance hendrick could have been naturalized in new york or britain prior to his arrival in virginia either would have been an acceptable origin for headright purposes   hance also owned land in adjacent new kent county south of pamunkey neck as early as  when it was processioned by  he had sold it because it was referred to as the lands of hance hendrick now belonging to mr anthony winston when it was next processioned the only colonial records that remain in new kent are in the vestry books of three of its six parishes there are only two references to a hendrick in these records both hance hendrick sr and hance hendrick jun filed patents on  march  for land in king william county the land  and  acres respectively appears to be close but not adjoining as both patents were for land on or near boot swamp a creek of the mattapony which lies almost entirely within what later became caroline county this is a reasonable indication that hans hendrick jr was another son   on  september  hans hendrick adolphus hendrick and william hendrick all filed patents for land in neighboring spottsylvania county hance hendrick of king william county claimed  acres of new land william hendrick of king william county claimed  acres in the same vicinity and adolphus hendrick see below claimed  acres none seem to have lived on their lands there the lack of a modifier may indicate that hance hendrick sr was dead by this date jr and sr applied to hance were not seen again until  despite numerous intervening references to hance hendrick the destruction of the early records of king william hanover and caroline counties prevent us from being more accurate as to his date of death or from finding records of his will or estate   the children of hance hendrick and presumably his wife jane seem to include at least the following hans and these presumed children are the only hendricks found anywhere in virginia records of the time with the exception of a widow hendricks in  there are no further records of jane hendrick although a series of  court records concern a jane hendrick who had a bastard child surely not hance hendricks widow   sources  virginia patent book  p  the process for obtaining headright patents required one to first obtain a certificate of importation after waiting at least three years after the importation itself thus the importation into virginia had to have occurred  or earlier  virginia patent book  p  the quit rents of virginia  annie laurie wright smith  p  the pamunkey neck encompassed the area between the mattapony and pamunkey rivers nowadays encompassing king william county the southern part of caroline county and southern spottsylvania county it was administratively part of new kent county until  when it was part of king  queen county when the pamunkeys subjugated themselves to the king in  it

————————————————————————————————————————————— death                        misc notes following from ancestrycom kith  kin mckinzie blythe branch  bartlett from the files of robert w baird   jane hendricks identity is unknown it is widely reported in published genealogies and on the internet that she was jannetze van meyer daughter of macyken hendrickson and jon josten van meter and a first cousin of hance hendrick the original source of this claim is evidently a history of the hendricks family however there is not a shred of documentation to support this claim and in fact there is no evidence that jon josten van meter an immigrant to new jersey who never set foot in virginia even had a daughter of that name if he did she would likely have been considerably older than hance of the four published accounts of this family that i have found none offer any documentation or explanation for their claims in this regard and all four authors were evidently unaware of most of the records cited in this paper   unfortunately hance hendrick lived in an area of virginia for which few colonial records exist the colonial records of new kent county were destroyed by the malicious burning of the courthouse in  for which the arsonist was hung it was a devastating loss for genealogists because the early records of several successor counties were in that courthouse including king william county most remaining early records of king william county were subsequently destroyed in another courthouse fire       children thomas hans hance hendrick abt   aft   jane        william hendrick abt

helpful yes no thanks for your feedback share on facebook share on twitter share on google confirmed service customer jul   dealership very good experience cadillac ability to fix a problem with my vehicle is wholly dependent on gms ability to support the electronic portions of their product iphone and carplay support are clearly malfunctioning in my ct and in all cts and according to the dealership there are gmcadillac technical bulletins indicating such problems and more than  days with no fix gm wants to blame apple apple believes it is a problem with the gm head unit  so the customer pays the price however since the cadillac falsely advertised carplay and it doesnt work properly with any version of the iphone it means not enough testing was done to support the advertising claim on the part of cadillac and now the dealership cant fix it and can only apologize and blame the vendor apple ouch victor o virginia beach read more was this review helpful yes no thanks for your

for your feedback share on facebook share on twitter share on google confirmed service customer jun   since  cadillac has been having problems with their cue dead spots and spiderweb cracking of the screen mine was brought in for replacement however i was not reassured that the replacement was a newer and improved product  simply a never used before cue and that there shouldnt be a problem if the same issues reoccur i also had to wait  weeks for the delivery of the new cue vs the one week i was promised otherwise the service reps were all friendly and tried to remain as positive as they could the waiting room is always comfortable and super clean with a refrigerator filled with chilled water and multiple choices of coffee wish they had hot chocolate for us noncoffee drinkers edward y
