therapies for the treatment of cancer our marketed product adcetrisr or brentuximab vedotin is now approved by the united states food and drug administration or fda and the european commission for three indications encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma or salcl adcetris is commercially available in  countries around the world including in the united states canada members of the european union and japan we are collaborating with takeda pharmaceutical company limited or takeda to develop and commercialize adcetris on a global basis under this collaboration seattle genetics retains commercial rights for adcetris in the united states and its territories and in canada and takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world beyond our current labeled indications we and takeda have a broad development strategy for adcetris evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with hodgkin lymphoma or mature tcell lymphoma or mtcl also known as peripheral tcell lymphoma or ptcl including salcl and in other cdexpressing malignancies we and takeda are currently conducting three phase  clinical trials of adcetris alcanza echelon and echelon all of these trials are being conducted under special protocol assessment or spa agreements with the fda and pursuant to scientific advice from the european medicines agency or ema an spa is an agreement with the fda regarding the design of the clinical trial including size and clinical endpoints to support an efficacy claim in a new drug application or a biologics license application or bla submission to the fda if the trial achieves its primary endpoints we plan to submit a supplemental biologics license application or sbla to the fda in mid to seek approval for a new indication in cdexpressing relapsed ctcl we have also completed enrollment of  patients in our echelon trial and expect to report data in  in november  we completed enrollment of  patients in our echelon trial and expect to report data in  we are also advancing the development of sgncda or vadastuximab talirine a phase  clinical trial called the cascade trial was initiated in the second quarter of  based on data from our phase  clinical trial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia or aml the cascade trial is evaluating sgncda in combination with hypomethylating agents or hmas in previously untreated older patients with aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy in addition we plan to initiate a randomized phase  trial during  evaluating sgncda in combination with standard of care chemotherapy in frontline younger aml patients on march   we announced that the fda had lifted the clinical hold announced on december   on phase  trials of sgncda in aml in addition in collaboration with astellas pharma inc or astellas we are developing asgme or enfortumab vedotin based on recent discussions with the fda in the second half of  we and astellas plan to initiate a pivotal phase  clinical trial for metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy our clinicalstage pipeline also includes six other antibodydrug conjugate or adc programs consisting of sgnliva sgncda or denintuzumab mafodotin sgncdb sgncda sgncda and asgme as well as two immunooncology agents seacd which is based on our sugarengineered antibody or sea technology and sgnff which is a novel small molecule in addition we have multiple preclinical and researchstage programs that employ our proprietary technologies including sgncda table of contents we announced on february   that we had entered into a development and license agreement or the immunomedics license with immunomedics inc or immunomedics pursuant to which upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the immunomedics license we would receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop manufacture and commercialize sacituzumab govitecan or immu immu is an adc targeted to trop which is expressed in several solid tumors and is in a pivotal phase  trial for patients with triple negative breast cancer or tnbc and is being investigated in other solid tumors immu received breakthrough therapy designation or btd from the fda for the treatment of patients with tnbc who have failed prior therapies for metastatic disease in the event that the transaction closes under the terms of the immunomedics license we would pay immunomedics an upfront payment of  million in addition immunomedics would also be eligible to receive development regulatory and salesdependent milestone payments across multiple indications and geographical regions of up to a total maximum of approximately  billion as well as royalties which would be based on a percentage of annual net sales of the licensed products if any beginning in the teens and rising to twenty percent based on sales volume in addition on february   we also entered into an agreement or the stock purchase agreement to purchase  shares of common stock of immunomedics at an aggregate purchase price of  million and on february   immunomedics issued us a warrant to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock of immunomedics at an exercise price of  per share which is exercisable until february   on february   we were named a codefendant in a lawsuit filed by venbio select advisors llc or venbio in the delaware chancery court or the court against the members of the board of directors of immunomedics pursuant to which among other things venbio sought to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the immunomedics license on march   the court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining taking any action in furtherance of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the immunomedics license the temporary restraining order will remain in place pending a trial on the merits currently scheduled for june   we cannot predict the outcome of this legal proceeding or the impact it may have on the immunomedics license or the stock purchase agreement or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the immunomedics license however it is possible that in connection with the venbio lawsuit the immunomedics license or the stock purchase agreement could be terminated rescinded or reformed in a way that is disadvantageous to us including a potential increase in the transaction consideration payable to immunomedics under the immunomedics license or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the immunomedics license in any event we may be unable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the immunomedics license whether as a result of the venbio lawsuit or otherwise in which case we will not realize any of the benefits of the licensing of immu we have collaborations for our adc technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including abbvie biotechnology ltd or abbvie bayer pharma ag or bayer celldex therapeutics inc or celldex genentech inc a member of the roche group or genentech glaxosmithkline llc or gsk pfizer inc or pfizer and psma development company llc a subsidiary of progenics pharmaceuticals inc or progenics in addition we have entered into a  codevelopmentagreement with agensys inc an affiliate of astellas for the development of adcs including asgme we also have an option for an adc codevelopment agreement with genmab as or genmab and a collaboration with unum therapeutics inc or unum to develop and commercialize novel antibodycoupled tcell receptor or actr therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer our ongoing research development and commercial activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful over the next several years we expect that we will incur substantial expenses primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization of adcetris and the continued development of adcetris and sgncda our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development sgncda and our other product candidates will require significant further development financial resources and personnel to pursue and obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products if at all in addition sgncda is our only product candidate in late stage clinical development and if we are unable to advance the development of sgncda or if we fail to produce positive results in the cascade trial the commercialization prospects for sgncda as well as our business and financial prospects would be materially adversely affected our commitment of resources to the continuing development regulatory and commercialization activities for adcetris the research continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates and the transactions contemplated by the immunomedics license if consummated would likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses would fluctuate as a result of such activities in addition we may incur significant milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization we recognize revenue from adcetris product sales in the united states and canada our future adcetris product sales are difficult to accurately predict from period to period in this regard our product sales have varied and may continue to vary significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors such factors include the incidence rate of new patients in adcetris approved indications customer ordering patterns the overall level of demand for adcetris the duration of therapy for patients receiving adcetris and the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for adcetris is available from government and other thirdparty payers obtaining and maintaining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for adcetris is increasingly challenging due to among other things the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the us and worldwide as well as increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the united states with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices we anticipate that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for adcetris we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system table of contents any of which could negatively affect our revenue or sales of adcetris or any future approved products we also believe that the level of our current adcetris sales in the united states has been attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with adcetris which can vary significantly from period to period moreover we believe that the incidence rate in adcetris approved indications is relatively low particularly when compared to many other oncology indications for these and other reasons we expect that our ability to accelerate adcetris sales growth if at all will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand adcetris labeled indications of use particularly with respect to the frontline hodgkin lymphoma and frontline mtcl indications our efforts to continue to expand adcetris labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful our ability to successfully commercialize adcetris and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed in part ii item a of this quarterly report on form q in particular negative or inconclusive results in our echelon and echelon trials would negatively impact or preclude altogether our ability to obtain regulatory approval in the frontline hodgkin lymphoma and frontline mtcl indications respectively either of which could limit our sales of and the commercial potential of adcetris in addition although we reported in august  that the alcanza trial evaluating adcetris in patients with relapsed ctcl met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the rate of objective response lasting at least four months and we plan to submit an sbla to the fda to seek approval for a new indication in cdexpressing relapsed ctcl there can be no assurance that the fda will accept our planned sbla for filing or that we will ultimately obtain approval of our planned sbla in a timely manner or at all our failure to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize adcetris in the alcanza treatment setting would also limit our sales of and the commercial potential of adcetris we also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements including royalties will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows these revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements including our adcetris collaboration with takeda as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and as a result we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance financial summary for the three months ended march   total revenues decreased to  million compared to  million for the same period in  this decrease was driven primarily by royalty revenues which included a onetime  million milestone payment in  offset by an increase in adcetris net product sales net product sales of adcetris were  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   for the three months ended march   total costs and expenses increased to  million compared to  million for the same period in  this primarily reflects increased investment in asgme and sgncda as well as investment in our growing pipeline of preclinical and clinicalstage programs as of march   we had  million in cash cash equivalents and short and longterm investments and  million in total stockholders equity table of contents results of operations three months ended march   and  net product sales we sell adcetris in the us and canada our net product sales were as follows  in thousands three months ended march     change net product sales       the increase in net product sales for the three months ended march   over the comparable period in  primarily resulted from an increase in sales volume in the  period and to a lesser extent from the effect of price increases instituted since the  period the increase in sales volume in  was primarily driven by increased use of adcetris across multiple lines of therapy in hodgkin lymphoma and for the treatment of other cdexpressing malignancies we expect continued growth in adcetris sales in  as compared to  our ability to accelerate the rate of adcetris sales growth in future periods if at all will be primarily dependent on our ability to continue to expand adcetris labeled indications of use our efforts to expand adcetris labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful we sell adcetris through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors customers order adcetris through these distributors and we typically ship product directly to the customer we record product sales when title and risk of loss pass which generally occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer product sales are recorded net of estimated governmentmandated rebates and chargebacks distribution fees estimated product returns and other deductions these are generally referred to as grosstonet deductions accruals are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals we reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction sales deductions are based on our estimates that consider payer mix in target markets and our experience to date these estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment governmentmandated rebates and chargebacks we have entered into a medicaid drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare  medicaid services this agreement provides for a rebate to participating states based on covered purchases of adcetris medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state medicaid programs we estimate medicaid rebates based on a variety of factors including our experience to date we also have completed our federal supply schedule or fss agreement under which certain us government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of adcetris we have entered into a pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the secretary of health and human services which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the public health services act or phs to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of adcetris under these agreements distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price as a result of our directship distribution model we can identify the entities purchasing adcetris and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for fss and phs purchases based on each entitys eligibility for the fss and phs programs we also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates distribution fees product returns and other deductions our distributors charge a volumebased fee for distribution services that they perform for us we allow for the return of product that is within  days of its expiration date or that is damaged we estimate product returns based on our experience to date in addition we consider our directship distribution model our belief that product is not typically held in the distribution channel and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers we provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through seagen secure seagen secure is available to patients in the us and its territories who meet various financial and treatment need criteria estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under seagen secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization these estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience table of contents grosstonetdeductions net of related payments and credits are summarized as follows in thousands distribution fees rebates and product returns chargebacks and other total balance as of december         provision related to current period sales    adjustment for prior period sales       paymentscredits for current period sales       paymentscredits for prior period sales       balance as of march         mandatory government discounts are the most significant component of our total gross to net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing these discount percentages increased during the three months ended march   over the comparable period in  as a result of price increases we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation and to a lesser extent as a result of an increase in sales eligible for government mandated rebates or chargebacks generally the change in government prices is limited to the rate of inflation we expect future grosstonet deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases the rate of inflation and other factors we implemented a price increase at the beginning of  as a result of this price increase and a continued increase in the percentage of our gross sales that are eligible for government mandated rebates and chargebacks we expect grosstonet deductions to increase in  in recent months there has been extensive discussion in the united states about expanding government discount programs including allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing is expected to increase if government discounted programs are expanded or discounts increased as a result of changes in regulations in the united states our gross to net deductions will increase and our net sales will be negatively impacted collaboration and license agreement revenues our proprietary adc technologies are the basis of our adc collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies under these adc collaboration agreements we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and typically provide technology transfer services technical advice supplies and services for a period of time if there are continuing performance obligations we use a timebased proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period for the related agreement collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting to date the precommercial deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time or period of time that revenue should be recognized we believe that the development period in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement accordingly all amounts received or due including any upfront payments maintenance fees development and regulatory milestone payments and reimbursement payments are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement these performance obligation periods typically range from one to three years the agreements with takeda and genentech have performance obligation periods of ten and seventeen years respectively all of the remaining performance obligation periods for our active collaborations are currently expected to be completed in three years or less when no performance obligations are required of us or following the completion of the performance obligation period such amounts are recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured generally all amounts received or due other than salesbased milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues as they are earned salesbased milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue as they are reported to us our collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones generally the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators product candidates from development to regulatory approval and then to commercialization table of contents development milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events designation of a product candidate or initiation of preclinical studies our collaborators must undertake significant preclinicalresearch and studies to make a determination of the suitability of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years initiation of a phase  clinical trial generally phase  clinical trials    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage note to parents this
