a nearby phillips petroleum co plant that considered the gas a useless byproduct of the oilrefining process he marketed propane to other new jersey homeowners who wanted gas for cooking and heating anton established an office in belleville a gas well in boonton and plants in belvidere farmingdale and livingston at the end of  the company went public as suburban propane gas co the first publicly
