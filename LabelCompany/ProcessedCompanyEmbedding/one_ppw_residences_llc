opposition of david schwartz and the exhibits annexed thereto plaintiffs memorandum of law in opposition dated september   defendants reply memorandum of law dated october   and the exhibit annexed thereto and the assignment assumption  o    and amendment to lease which is exhibit k to the agreement and after argument of counsel and due deliberation thereon defendants motion is denied for the reasons set forth below in this action plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract it entered into to buy the property located at  prospect park west brooklyn new york from defendants or in the alternative return of its down payment of  plaintiff claims that defendants anticipatorily breached the contract by scheduling the closing before satisfying all conditions precedent in the agreement defendants claim that they were ready willing and able to close and that it was plaintiff who breached the contract by failing to appear at the closing on august   plaintiff entered into an agreement dated january   to purchase the property from defendants for  the agreement the property is improved by a nine story building part of which is currently leased to  prospect park residence llc the operator who operates an assisted living facility at the site the residence the agreement provided that the closing would take place when two conditions were satisfied the first condition was that the new york state department of health doh approve the operators closing plan the second condition was that the fourth floor of the building become vacant section a of the agreement provided for a down payment of  of which oooooo was paid upon execution of the agreement and  was to be paid within  days of confirmation that the fourth floor was vacant the operator submitted its closure plan for doh approval on september   and doh notified the operator by letter dated february   that doh    approved implementation of its plan the plan set april   as the closure date of the residence section  of the agreement provides that the plaintiff could set the closing date of the property provided it was within  days of doh closure plan approval and of · confirmation that the fourth floor was vacant section  also provided that time would be of the essence as to an extended closing date section e of the agreement provides that at closing that the plaintiff would enter into an amended lease with the operator to continue to operate the facility pursuant to the closure plan until the facility was closed the agreement also provided monetary incentives to the defendants to reach settlements with the residents who remained section  of the agreement provides that in the event of a default by defendants plaintiff may either cancel the agreement and have the down payment returned or sue defendants for specific performance section  of the agreement provides that in the event of a default by the plaintiff defendants shall be entitled to cancel the contract and retain the downpayment as liquidated damages section  also provides that the written agreement represents the full agreement between the parties and that its terms may not be amended except in writing on june   plaintiff confirmed that the fourth floor was vacant and tendered the  balance of the down payment on june   joshua marlow an officer of plaintiff notified harry freifeld esq defendants closing attorney that pursuant to section  of the agreement plaintiff was extending the closing date until august      on july   plaintiffs attorney sent an email to freifeld stating that plaintiff intended to close the week of july th most probably on august st plaintiff alleges that on july   it was informed by defendants landlordtenant attorney that the operator could not commence proceedings to remove the residents because it had not surrendered its license and that pursuant to the regulations it could not surrender its license until all of the residents vacated on july   plaintiff received a title report which listed two proceedings commenced by residents of the facility as title objections freifeld sent plaintiffs closing attorneys a letter dated july   stating that time was of the essence as to the august st closing date and that if plaintiff did not close on august st the defendants would consider plaintiff in default of the agreement and would retain the downpayment as liquidated damages on july   attorneys for plaintiff sent defendants closing attorney a copy of a title report which listed as an exception two law suits commenced by residents of the facility the letter also gave defendants notice that pursuant to section  of the agreement the plaintiff objected to this exception and stated that the lawsuits were not a permitted exception under the agreement the title report indicates that this exception was listed on july   also on july   another attorney for plaintiff sent a letter to freifeld stating that the plaintiff was ready willing and able to close but that the closing could not be scheduled because of the residents lawsuits challenging the operators closure plan and because the operator could not commence special proceedings before surrendering its operating license    in response freifeld sent plaintiffs attorneys a letter also dated july   stating that defendants did not consider the residents lawsuits a valid title objection and informing plaintiff that seller would tender the deed at the closing scheduled for august   and would deem the plaintiff in default if it did not close on that date defendants appeared at the closing on august st and indicated that they were prepared to close plaintiff did not appear at the closing on august   freifeld notified plaintiffs attorneys by letter that the defendants had demanded that freifeld release to them the downpayment which he was holding in escrow on august   plaintiffs attorney notified freifeld that plaintiff remained ready willing and able to close and proposed three possible alternatives to closing under the terms of the contract also on august   mark noordsy an attorney with doh sent a letter to attorneys for the operator stating that it was his opinion that surrender of its operating certificate was not a prerequisite to initiating special proceedings to remove the residents on august   defendants extended the time for plaintiff to terminate the contract until august   the extension was given without prejudice the parties subsequently met but were unable to reach a resolution the plaintiff did not terminate the agreement on august   but instead commenced this action which seeks specific performance or in the alternative a declaration that plaintiff is entitled to return of the deposit and other monetary damages    defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and for a judgment declaring that plaintiff is in material default under the terms of the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the downpayment defendants arguments defendants argue that there is no question that plaintiff defaulted under the terms of the agreement by failing to attend the august  closing and that the terms of the agreement between the parties were clear and unambiguous they contend that the conditions precedent to closing were doh approval of the operators closure plan and vacatur of the fourth floor both of which were satisfied they argue that the agreement did not condition the sale on resolution of any challenges to the closure plan only upon do hs approval of the plan they also argue that the agreement did not require that the building be delivered vacant and specifically contemplated the operator continuing to operate the facility after the closing pursuant to an amended lease defendants further argue that the parties were sophisticated real estate investors represented by counsel and that the agreement should be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms specifically that the term doh closure plan approval means nothing more than when doh approves the closure plan submitted by the operator defendants argue that nothing in the agreement required that the closing plan be capable of being implemented they further argue that the fact that the residents challenged the plan does not mean it cannot be implemented only that it might be more difficult expensive and time consuming to evict all the residents which was a risk plaintiff assumed under the agreement    defendants argue that had the parties intended to make the sale contingent on resolution of any legal challenges to the closure plan they could have done so but they did not defendants further argue that plaintiffs conduct demonstrates that the intent of the parties was that the residents lawsuit was not a bar to closing defendants point to plaintiffs tender of the additional  of the downpayment on june th  despite plaintiffs monitoring of the ongoing lawsuit they also point to plaintiffs june th notice to extend the closing date to august st and the july th email to defendants attorney stating that plaintiff expected to close during the week of july th defendants argue that these acts evidence that the agreement contemplated closing even though the residents lawsuit was not resolved defendants argue that even though the residents lawsuits are listed as title exceptions in the title report procured by plaintiff several sections of the agreement explicitly provide that the plaintiff is purchasing subject to the existing residents occupancy rights and therefore the suits are not valid objections to title defendants also argue that plaintiff did not raise the alleged title objections within the time provided by section  of the agreement defendants contend that they are entitled not only to dismissal of the complaint but also to a declaration that plaintiff is in default of the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the downpayment as liquidated damages pursuant to section  of the agreement plaintiffs arguments plaintiff argues that it was not obligated to close on august st because defendants had not satisfied the conditions precedent to the agreement as the closure    plan could not be implemented plaintiff alleges that defendants notified it on july   shortly before the closing date that the operator could not implement the closure plan as of the closing date because of conflicting regulations specifically the operator could not commence proceedings to evict the remaining residents until it surrendered its license and it could not surrender its license until the remaining residents left plaintiff further argues that the term doh closure plan approval in the agreement is ambiguous and open to two reasonable interpretations plaintiff argues that the intent of the requirement in the agreement that defendants obtain an approval of their closure plan as a precondition to closing on the property was that defendants would be able implement the approved plan plaintiffs argue that in determining the meaning of the term doh closure plan approval one must consider what a reasonable person in the position of the promisee would understand the term to include plaintiff further argues that the term is susceptible to two interpretations because the agreement is silent as to what would be done if the plan could not be implemented and that neither side considered the possibility that a closure plan approved by doh could not be implemented plaintiff argues that its conduct in paying the second portion of the down payment and scheduling the closing for august st while it was aware of the residents lawsuits is not inconsistent with its position in this action because plaintiff did not become aware that the closure plan could not be implemented until after those actions plaintiff further argues that the residents lawsuits were listed in its title report as exceptions and since defendants had not cured the exceptions defendants were not ready willing or able to convey clear and marketable title on august st    plaintiff also argues that defendants failed to secure pay for and maintain the insurance policies required under the amendment to the operating lease which was a condition to closing under the agreement plaintiff argues that defendants conduct after august st evidenced an intent to continue to be bound the agreement lastly plaintiff argues that in the event that plaintiff were denied specific performance defendants are not entitled to keep the downpayment because they breached the agreement by failing to satisfy the conditions precedent to close on the property and failed to secure the insurance required under the amendment to the operating lease discussion summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should not be granted where there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue of fact or where such issue is even arguable kolivas v kirchoff  add   nysd  nd dept  on a motion for summary judgment the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party marcum v silva  add   nysd  nd dept  escobar v velez  add   nysd  nd dept  a party opposing summary

judgment is inappropriate in real property disputes where there is a question of fact as to whether the conditions precedent of the contract of sale were satisfied lazy s group iv gomez  add   nysd  nd dept     plaintiff argues there is a question of fact as to whether the intent of the parties in making the agreement was that the closure plan be capable of being implemented the plaintiffs allegation that defendants had not satisfied the condition precedent of the agreement because the closure plan by it terms could not be implemented is separate and distinct from the fact that the residents filed a suit to challenge the plan the closure plan which was approved on february th called for the facility to close by april ththe closure plan however made no provision for what would occur if the residents did not vacate within the short time period set forth in the plan pursuant to social services law section g  e an operator voluntarily closing its facility cannot terminate a residency agreement until it has surrendered the operating certificate for the facility similarly  nycrr  f  v and  nycrr  f  v provide that an operator may terminate an admission agreement when it has voluntarily surrendered the operating certificate of the facility to the department both the statute and regulation clearly provide for termination of residency agreements only after the operating certificate has been surrendered doh attorney mark noordsy sent a letter to defendants dated august   one week after the closing date stating that he believed that surrender of the operating license was not a prerequisite for commencing a special proceeding pursuant to social services law section h however he cited no statutory authority for this opinion which contradicts the clear language of both the statute and regulations the only authority cited in noordsys letter is a single bronx civil court case from  braker memorial home v white miscd   nysd  civil ct bx  the court in braker held that statutory requirements that the operator surrender    their operating certificate before commencing a special proceeding are apparently in conflict with subdivision  of section b section d subd  par a and section f of the social services law which impose civil and criminal sanctions for surrendering the certificate while the facility remains in operation id at  however the statutory sections cited by the court in braker do not in fact provide for any sanctions for surrendering the certificate while a facility remains in operation sections b and d  a prohibit an operator from operating a facility without a certificate which is a different matter when the operator sent notices to the residents that it intended to commence special proceeding to evict them this court granted the residents a preliminary injunction enjoining the operator from commencing the proceedings in part because the operator had not surrendered its license the closure plan did not provide for a receiver or other licensed operator to take over the facility in the event the operator chose to surrender its license commence special proceedings to evict the residents in the absence of such provision the plan as approved by doh by its terms could not be implemented while the residents unwillingness to vacate date revealed the defect which was inherent in the closure plan it was the failure of the plan to provide for a temporary administrator or receiver to operate the facility if the operator chose to evict the residents rather than lawsuits themselves which prevented implementation of the plan plaintiff states that defendants landlordtenant attorney notified plaintiff that the operator could not commence special proceedings on july th months before the court issued an injunction against defendants commencing special proceedings    the fact that the closure plan as approved could not be implemented is only relevant to the extent that the agreement required that the closure plan be capable of being implemented this in turn depends on what the parties to the agreement meant by the term doh closure plan approval where the terms of a contract are unambiguous the court must not ignore the plain meaning of its terms or rewrite the language of the contract an ambiguity will be found only where reasonable minds could differ as to what was intended by the parties computer assoc

credibility of extrinsic evidence or a choice among inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence then the issue is one of fact amusement business underwiters v american international group inc  nyd   nysd   sutton v east river sau bank  nyd   nysd   it is uncontested that the agreement envisioned the plaintiff closing on the property even though there were residents still left in the facility and made specific provisions for the operator to continue to manage the facility while the closure plan was being implemented section  e of the agreement provided for this contingency by assigning the lease between the operator and the building owner to the plaintiffs and amending its terms to provide that the operator would continue to operate the facility and diligently    and in good faith carry out the closure plan section  aii of the amendment to the operating lease section e of the agreement made entering into the amendment to the operating lease a condition of the closing stating for the avoidance of doubt the closing is contingent upon and shall not be deemed to have occurred unless operator fully complies with its obligations under the amendment to lease on the effective date as defined herein the agreement provided that upon closing on the property  of the purchase price would be set aside in a tenant escrow fund as an incentive to relocate any remaining residents the amendment to the operating lease provided for plaintiff to potentially fund an additional bonus amount of  to be used to induce any remaining residents to relocate within  months after the closing on the property while plaintiff agreed to close on the property even with residents remaining and the facility still being open the agreement did not require the plaintiff to assume responsibility either for closing the facility or for operating the facility until it was closed the agreement provided that the operator would carry out the closure plan and wind down operations of the facility pursuant to the closure plan there is a significant difference between purchasing a property with residents remaining while a closure plan with a date for closing the facility is in place and purchasing a property with remaining residents while there is no closure plan in place the time risks and costs of relocating the residents and closing the facility are significantly greater if there is no closure plan in place than if there is one in place the fact that doh approval of the closure plan was one of the two conditions precedent to closing demonstrates that even though plaintiff had committed to closing    on the building while the facility was still operating the agreement contemplated that the facility would be closed pursuant to the approved closure plan implementation is an integral part of the closure plan without the ability to implement the plan the plan itself is oflittle if any significance defendants interpretation of the meaning of approval of the plan is controvertible when considered in the context of the whole agreement indeed there seems little reason to have made a  sale of property contingent upon doh closure plan approval without the understanding or assumption that the plan could be implemented if it was approved by doh defendants interpretation that implementability is not part of doh closure plan approval is at odds with the fact that the february th letter from doh states that the department approves the implementation of the closure plan   significantly the doh approval on which defendants rely approved implementation of the plan both the agreement and the amendment to the operating lease are silent on what would occur if the closure plan could not be implemented there is no indication in the agreement as to which party would bear the risk and increased costs of the delay which would result in the event that the operator was unable to implement the closure plan it is an open question whether this contingency was ever considered by the parties no evidence has been submitted by either party that there was any discussion or agreement among the parties as to what would happen if the closure plan could not be implemented in determining whether there is ambiguity in the term doh closure plan approval the court must consider the term in light of the entire agreement including    the amendment to the operating lease which was made a condition of the closing under the agreement the amendment to the operating lease indicates that both sides intended that in the event there were residents remaining at the time of the closing the operator would continue to operate the facility and would close the facility pursuant to the terms of the closure plan considering the text of the agreement alone both plaintiffs and defendants interpretations of the term doh closure plan approval are reasonable interpretations at a minim um there is a question of fact as to whether the parties intent was that doh closure plan approval meant approval of a plan that was capable of being implemented it is necessary to look to evidence extrinsic to the agreement to determine what the intent of the parties was defendants further argument that the plaintiffs conduct after becoming aware of the residents lawsuits demonstrated that the lawsuits were not an obstacle to closing conflates the residents objections to the plan with the fact that the plan could not be implemented it was the inability to implement the closure plan independent of the residents lawsuits that was by itself an obstacle to closing on june th the day that plaintiff made the additional  down payment the parties were unaware that the closure plan could not be implemented the stipulation entered into in the residents actions on june th provided that the stipulation would not affect the operators ability to initiate special proceedings to evict the residents this indicates that as of that date the parties were still unaware that the operator could not commence special proceedings under the closure plan    plaintiff asserts that it did not learn that the plan could not be implemented until its attorneys were informed of that fact by defendants attorneys on july th similarly it was not until july th that the title company included the residents lawsuits as title exceptions as the plaintiff was unaware until one week before the scheduled august st closing that the plan could not be implemented its prior actions in completing the down payment and setting the closing date do not demonstrate that plaintiff intended that doh approval of a closure plan that could not be implemented would satisfy the conditions precedent of the agreement it is unclear from the record whether the continued negotiations between the parties after august st including the agreement to extend plaintiffs time to terminate the agreement until august th evidence an intent to continue to perform under the agreement or an attempt to negotiate a new terms defendants have also moved for a declaration that plaintiff is in material default of under the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the down payment as liquidated damages as there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the approval of a closure plan that could not be implemented satisfied the conditions precedent of the agreement granting defendants summary judgment declaring plaintiff in default of the agreement for failing to close on august st is not warranted further there is an issue of fact whether defendant satisfied the requirement that it secure pay for and maintain the insurance policies required under the amendment to the operating lease assumption of the amended lease was a condition of the closing under the agreement proof of insurance was not tendered at the attempted closing on august st and the certificate ofliability insurance submitted by    the defendants with their moving papers does not establish that defendants actually secured and paid for the required insurance as of august st the certificate submitted is labeled sample and it does not include the name of the insurer nor a policy number defendants have not established at this point that they met the insurance requirements and on that additional basis have not met their burden for summary judgment wherefore defendants motion for summary judgment is denied the parties are

april   decision and order wayne p saitta judge defendants have moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and declaring the plaintiff is in material default of a contract to sell the property located at  prospect park west brooklyn new york the motion having come before the court on november   and upon reading the notice of motion dated september   and affidavit in support of haysha deitsch sworn to september   and the exhibits attached thereto the memorandum of law of heller horowitz  feit pc attorneys for defendants dated september   the affirmation in opposition of joshua siegel esq member of the firm of kasowitz benson torres  friedman llp attorneys for plaintiff dated september   the affidavit in opposition of david schwartz and the exhibits annexed thereto plaintiffs memorandum of law in opposition dated september   defendants reply memorandum of law dated october   and the exhibit annexed thereto and the assignment assumption and amendment to lease which is exhibit k to the agreement and after argument of counsel and due deliberation thereon defendants motion is denied for the reasons set forth below in this action plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract it entered into to buy the property located at  prospect park west brooklyn new york from defendants or in the alternative return of its downpayment of  plaintiff claims that defendants anticipatorily breached the contract by scheduling the closing before satisfying all conditions precedent in the agreement defendants claim that they were ready willing and able to close and that it was plaintiff who breached the contract by failing to appear at the closing on august   plaintiff entered into an agreement dated january   to purchase the property from defendants for  the agreement the property is improved by a nine story building part of which is currently leased to  prospect park residence llc the operator who operates an assisted living facility at the site the residence the agreement provided that the closing would take place when two conditions were satisfied the first condition was that the new york state department of health doh approve the operators closing plan the second condition was that the fourth floor of the building become vacant section a of the agreement provided for a downpayment of  of which  was paid upon execution of the agreement and  was to be paid within  days of confirmation that the fourth floor was vacant the operator submitted its closure plan for doh approval on september   and doh notified the operator by letter dated february   that doh approved implementation of its plan the plan set april   as the closure date of the residence section  of the agreement provides that the plaintiff could set the closing date of the property provided it was within  days of doh closure plan approval and of confirmation that the fourth floor was vacant section  also provided that time would be of the essence as to an extended closing date section e of the agreement provides that at closing that the plaintiff would enter into an amended lease with the operator to continue to operate the facility pursuant to the closure plan until the facility was closed the agreement also provided monetary incentives to the defendants to reach settlements with the residents who remained section  of the agreement provides that in the event of a default by defendants plaintiff may either cancel the agreement and have the downpayment returned or sue defendants for specific performance section  of the agreement provides that in the event of a default by the plaintiff defendants shall be entitled to cancel the contract and retain the downpayment as liquidated damages section  also provides that the written agreement represents the full agreement between the parties and that its terms may not be amended except in writing on june   plaintiff confirmed that the fourth floor was vacant and tendered the  balance of the downpayment on june   joshua marlow an officer of plaintiff notified harry freifeld esq defendants closing attorney that pursuant to section  of the agreement plaintiff was extending the closing date until august   on july   plaintiffs attorney sent an email to freifeld stating that plaintiff intended to close the week of july th most probably on august st plaintiff alleges that on july   it was informed by defendants landlordtenant attorney that the operator could not commence proceedings to remove the residents because it had not surrendered its license and that pursuant to the regulations it could not surrender its license until all of the residents vacated on july   plaintiff received a title report which listed two proceedings commenced by residents of the facility as title objections freifeld sent plaintiffs closing attorneys a letter dated july   stating that time was of the essence as to the august st closing date and that if plaintiff did not close on august st the defendants would consider plaintiff in default of the agreement and would retain the downpayment as liquidated damages on july   attorneys for plaintiff sent defendants closing attorney a copy of a title report which listed as an exception two law suits commenced by residents of the facility the letter also gave defendants notice that pursuant to section  of the agreement the plaintiff objected to this exception and stated that the lawsuits were not a permitted exception under the agreement the title report indicates that this exception was listed on july   also on july   another attorney for plaintiff sent a letter to freifeld stating that the plaintiff was ready willing and able to close but that the closing could not be scheduled because of the residents lawsuits challenging the operators closure plan and because the operator could not commence special proceedings before surrendering its operating license in response freifeld sent plaintiffs attorneys a letter also dated july   stating that defendants did not consider the residents lawsuits a valid title objection and informing plaintiff that seller would tender the deed at the closing scheduled for august   and would deem the plaintiff in default if it did not close on that date defendants appeared at the closing on august st and indicated that they were prepared to close plaintiff did not appear at the closing on august   freifeld notified plaintiffs attorneys by letter that the defendants had demanded that freifeld release to them the downpayment which he was holding in escrow on august   plaintiffs attorney notified freifeld that plaintiff remained ready willing and able to close and proposed three possible alternatives to closing under the terms of the contract also on august   mark noordsy an attorney with doh sent a letter to attorneys for the operator stating that it was his opinion that surrender of its operating certificate was not a prerequisite to initiating special proceedings to remove the residents on august   defendants extended the time for plaintiff to terminate the contract until august   the extension was given without prejudice the parties subsequently met but were unable to reach a resolution the plaintiff did not terminate the agreement on august   but instead commenced this action which seeks specific performance or in the alternative a declaration that plaintiff is entitled to return of the deposit and other monetary damages defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and for a judgment declaring that plaintiff is in material default under the terms of the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the downpayment defendants arguments defendants argue that there is no question that plaintiff defaulted under the terms of the agreement by failing to attend the august  closing and that the terms of the agreement between the parties were clear and unambiguous they contend that the conditions precedent to closing were doh approval of the operators closure plan and vacatur of the fourth floor both of which were satisfied they argue that the agreement did not condition the sale on resolution of any challenges to the closure plan only upon dohs approval of the plan they also argue that the agreement did not require that the building be delivered vacant and specifically contemplated the operator continuing to operate the facility after the closing pursuant to an amended lease defendants further argue that the parties were sophisticated real estate investors represented by counsel and that the agreement should be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms specifically that the term doh closure plan approval means nothing more than when doh approves the closure plan submitted by the operator defendants argue that nothing in the agreement required that the closing plan be capable of being implemented they further argue that the fact that the residents challenged the plan does not mean it cannot be implemented only that it might be more difficult expensive and time consuming to evict all the residents which was a risk plaintiff assumed under the agreement defendants argue that had the parties intended to make the sale contingent on resolution of any legal challenges to the closure plan they could have done so but they did not defendants further argue that plaintiffs conduct demonstrates that the intent of the parties was that the residents lawsuit was not a bar to closing defendants point to plaintiffs tender of the additional  of the downpayment on june th  despite plaintiffs monitoring of the ongoing lawsuit they also point to plaintiffs june th notice to extend the closing date to august st and the july th email to defendants attorney stating that plaintiff expected to close during the week of july th defendants argue that these acts evidence that the agreement contemplated closing even though the residents lawsuit was not resolved defendants argue that even though the residents lawsuits are listed as title exceptions in the title report procured by plaintiff several sections of the agreement explicitly provide that the plaintiff is purchasing subject to the existing residents occupancy rights and therefore the suits are not valid objections to title defendants also argue that plaintiff did not raise the alleged title objections within the time provided by section  of the agreement defendants contend that they are entitled not only to dismissal of the complaint but also to a declaration that plaintiff is in default of the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the downpayment as liquidated damages pursuant to section  of the agreement plaintiffs arguments plaintiff argues that it was not obligated to close on august st because defendants had not satisfied the conditions precedent to the agreement as the closure plan could not be implemented plaintiff alleges that defendants notified it on july   shortly before the closing date that the operator could not implement the closure plan as of the closing date because of conflicting regulations specifically the operator could not commence proceedings to evict the remaining residents until it surrendered its license and it could not surrender its license until the remaining residents left plaintiff further argues that the term doh closure plan approval in the agreement is ambiguous and open to two reasonable interpretations plaintiff argues that the intent of the requirement in the agreement that defendants obtain an approval of their closure plan as a precondition to closing on the property was that defendants would be able implement the approved plan plaintiffs argue that in determining the meaning of the term doh closure plan approval one must consider what a reasonable person in the position of the promisee would understand the term to include plaintiff further argues that the term is susceptible to two interpretations because the agreement is silent as to what would be done if the plan could not be implemented and that neither side considered the possibility that a closure plan approved by doh could not be implemented plaintiff argues that its conduct in paying the second portion of the downpayment and scheduling the closing for august st while it was aware of the residents lawsuits is not inconsistent with its position in this action because plaintiff did not become aware that the closure plan could not be implemented until after those actions plaintiff further argues that the residents lawsuits were listed in its title report as exceptions and since defendants had not cured the exceptions defendants were not ready willing or able to convey clear and marketable title on august st plaintiff also argues that defendants failed to secure pay for and maintain the insurance policies required under the amendment to the operating lease which was a condition to closing under the agreement plaintiff argues that defendants conduct after august st evidenced an intent to continue to be bound the agreement lastly plaintiff argues that in the event that plaintiff were denied specific performance defendants are not entitled to keep the downpayment because they breached the agreement by failing to satisfy the conditions precedent to close on the property and failed to secure the insurance required under the amendment to the operating lease discussion summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should not be granted where there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue of fact or where such issue is even arguable kolivas v kirchoff  add   nysd  nd dept  on a motion for summary judgment the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party marcum v silva  add

the contract of sale were satisfied lazy s group i v gomez  add   nysd  nd dept  plaintiff argues there is a question of fact as to whether the intent of the parties in making the agreement was that the closure plan be capable of being implemented the plaintiffs allegation that defendants had not satisfied the condition precedent of the agreement because the closure plan by it terms could not be implemented is separate and distinct from the fact that the residents filed a suit to challenge the plan the closure plan which was approved on february th called for the facility to close by april th the closure plan however made no provision for what would occur if the residents did not vacate within the short time period set forth in the plan pursuant to social services law section ge an operator voluntarily closing its facility cannot terminate a residency agreement until it has surrendered the operating certificate for the facility similarly  nycrr fv and  nycrr fv provide that an operator may terminate an admission agreement when it has voluntarily surrendered the operating certificate of the facility to the department both the statute and regulation clearly provide for termination of residency agreements only after the operating certificate has been surrendered doh attorney mark noordsy sent a letter to defendants dated august   one week after the closing date stating that he believed that surrender of the operating license was not a prerequisite for commencing a special proceeding pursuant to social services law section h however he cited no statutory authority for this opinion which contradicts the clear language of both the statute and regulations the only authority cited in noordsys letter is a single bronx civil court case from  braker memorial home v white  miscd   nysd  civil ct bx  the court in braker held that statutory requirements that the operator surrender their operating certificate before commencing a special proceeding are apparently in conflict with subdivision  of section b section d subd  par a and section f of the social services law which impose civil and criminal sanctions for surrendering the certificate while the facility remains in operation id at  however the statutory sections cited by the court in braker do not in fact provide for any sanctions for surrendering the certificate while a facility remains in operation sections b and da prohibit an operator from operating a facility without a certificate which is a different matter when the operator sent notices to the residents that it intended to commence special proceeding to evict them this court granted the residents a preliminary injunction enjoining the operator from commencing the proceedings in part because the operator had not surrendered its license the closure plan did not provide for a receiver or other licensed operator to take over the facility in the event the operator chose to surrender its license commence special proceedings to evict the residents in the absence of such provision the plan as approved by doh by its terms could not be implemented while the residents unwillingness to vacate date revealed the defect which was inherent in the closure plan it was the failure of the plan to provide for a temporary administrator or receiver to operate the facility if the operator chose to evict the residents rather than lawsuits themselves which prevented implementation of the plan plaintiff states that defendants landlordtenant attorney notified plaintiff that the operator could not commence special proceedings on july th months before the court issued an injunction against defendants commencing special proceedings the fact that the closure plan as approved could not be implemented is only relevant to the extent that the agreement required that the closure plan be capable of being implemented this in turn depends on what the parties to the agreement meant by the term doh closure plan approval where the terms of a contract are unambiguous the court must not ignore the plain meaning of its terms or rewrite the language of the contract an ambiguity will be found only where reasonable

issue is one of fact amusement business underwiters v american international group inc  nyd   nysd   sutton v east river sav bank  nyd   nysd   it is uncontested that the agreement envisioned the plaintiff closing on the property even though there were residents still left in the facility and made specific provisions for the operator to continue to manage the facility while the closure plan was being implemented section e of the agreement provided for this contingency by assigning the lease between the operator and the building owner to the plaintiffs and amending its terms to provide that the operator would continue to operate the facility and diligently and in good faith carry out the closure plan section aii of the amendment to the operating lease section e of the agreement made entering into the amendment to the operating lease a condition of the closing stating for the avoidance of doubt the closing is contingent upon and shall not be deemed to have occurred unless operator fully complies with its obligations under the amendment to lease on the effective date as defined herein the agreement provided that upon closing on the property  of the purchase price would be set aside in a tenant escrow fund as an incentive to relocate any remaining residents the amendment to the operating lease provided for plaintiff to potentially fund an additional bonus amount of  to be used to induce any remaining residents to relocate within  months after the closing on the property while plaintiff agreed to close on the property even with residents remaining and the facility still being open the agreement did not require the plaintiff to assume responsibility either for closing the facility or for operating the facility until it was closed the agreement provided that the operator would carry out the closure plan and wind down operations of the facility pursuant to the closure plan there is a significant difference between purchasing a property with residents remaining while a closure plan with a date for closing the facility is in place and purchasing a property with remaining residents while there is no closure plan in place the time risks and costs of relocating the residents and closing the facility are significantly greater if there is no closure plan in place than if there is one in place the fact that doh approval of the closure plan was one of the two conditions precedent to closing demonstrates that even though plaintiff had committed to closing on the building while the facility was still operating the agreement contemplated that the facility would be closed pursuant to the approved closure plan implementation is an integral part of the closure plan without the ability to implement the plan the plan itself is of little if any significance defendants interpretation of the meaning of approval of the plan is controvertible when considered in the context of the whole agreement indeed there seems little reason to have made a  sale of property contingent upon doh closure plan approval without the understanding or assumption that the plan could be implemented if it was approved by doh defendants interpretation that implementability is not part of doh closure plan approval is at odds with the fact that the february th letter from doh states that the department approves the implementation of the closure plan    significantly the doh approval on which defendants rely approved implementation of the plan both the agreement and the amendment to the operating lease are silent on what would occur if the closure plan could not be implemented there is no indication in the agreement as to which party would bear the risk and increased costs of the delay which would result in the event that the operator was unable to implement the closure plan it is an open question whether this contingency was ever considered by the parties no evidence has been submitted by either party that there was any discussion or agreement among the parties as to what would happen if the closure plan could not be implemented in determining whether there is ambiguity in the term doh closure plan approval the court must consider the term in light of the entire agreement including the amendment to the operating lease which was made a condition of the closing under the agreement the amendment to the operating lease indicates that both sides intended that in the event there were residents remaining at the time of the closing the operator would continue to operate the facility and would close the facility pursuant to the terms of the closure plan considering the text of the agreement alone both plaintiffs and defendants interpretations of the term doh closure plan approval are reasonable interpretations at a minimum there is a question of fact as to whether the parties intent was that doh closure plan approval meant approval of a plan that was capable of being implemented it is necessary to look to evidence extrinsic to the agreement to determine what the intent of the parties was defendants further argument that the plaintiffs conduct after becoming aware of the residents lawsuits demonstrated that the lawsuits were not an obstacle to closing conflates the residents objections to the plan with the fact that the plan could not be implemented it was the inability to implement the closure plan independent of the residents lawsuits that was by itself an obstacle to closing on june th the day that plaintiff made the additional  down payment the parties were unaware that the closure plan could not be implemented the stipulation entered into in the residents actions on june th provided that the stipulation would not affect the operators ability to initiate special proceedings to evict the residents this indicates that as of that date the parties were still unaware that the operator could not commence special proceedings under the closure plan plaintiff asserts that it did not learn that the plan could not be implemented until its attorneys were informed of that fact by defendants attorneys on july th similarly it was not until july th that the title company included the residents lawsuits as title exceptions as the plaintiff was unaware until one week before the scheduled august st closing that the plan could not be implemented its prior actions in completing the down payment and setting the closing date do not demonstrate that plaintiff intended that doh approval of a closure plan that could not be implemented would satisfy the conditions precedent of the agreement it is unclear from the record whether the continued negotiations between the parties after august st including the agreement to extend plaintiffs time to terminate the agreement until august th evidence an intent to continue to perform under the agreement or an attempt to negotiate a new terms defendants have also moved for a declaration that plaintiff is in material default of under the agreement and that defendants are entitled to keep the down payment as liquidated damages as there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the approval of a closure plan that could not be implemented satisfied the conditions precedent of the agreement granting defendants summary judgment declaring plaintiff in default of the agreement for failing to close on august st is not warranted further there is an issue of fact whether defendant satisfied the requirement that it secure pay for and maintain the insurance policies required under the amendment to the operating lease assumption of the amended lease was a condition of the closing under the agreement proof of insurance was not tendered at the attempted closing on august st and the certificate of liability insurance submitted by the defendants with their moving papers does not establish that defendants actually secured and paid for the required insurance as of august st the certificate submitted is labeled sample and it does not include the name of the insurer nor a policy number defendants have not established at this point that they met the insurance requirements and on that additional basis have not met their burden for summary judgment wherefore defendants motion for summary judgment is denied the parties are directed to appear in the intake part from a preliminary conference on april   this constitutes the decision and order of

at east new york housing complex knocks out electricity for  buildings thousands of residents brooklyn today       prospect park residence back in brooklyn court over eviction of seniors prospect park residence back in brooklyn court over eviction of seniors ruth willig  with her son bruce photo by mary frost now a lawsuit between seller deitsch and building buyers by mary frost brooklyn daily eagle families of the elderly residents living the brooklyn assisted living facility prospect park residence were shocked to learn in court last week that the landlord had made an agreement back in january to sell the property for  million according to court documents the deal would only close if the owner haysha deitsch cleared the elderly out of the th floor dementia unit and obtained a final discharge plan approved by the new york state department of health doh deitsch emptied the dementia unit by june  and doh approved a closure plan on feb   a legal dispute however has prevented the parties from closing on the sale deitsch bought the building in  for  million a group of city officials and senior advocates have been fighting the evictions since deitsch gave the seniors just  days to move out in march the seniors lost home is a real estate plumb  just a block away from grand army plaza across the street from prospect park roughly  elderly residents– many more than  years old  were “kicked out” unwillingly supporters say and some have died families say their elderly relatives are heartbroken and that deitsch continued to sign contracts even after he knew the residence was closing advocates say that doh “rubberstamped” the closure in april resident ruth willig age  told the brooklyn eagle “when i hear about places other people have gone they’re not as good they should take age into consideration and not treat us like garbage we’re human beings with feelings” residents’ families have filed for contempt saying deitsch has allowed conditions to deteriorate to speed residents’ departure seniors at the residence with the help of the legal aid society mfy legal services and probono representation from fitzpatrick cella have won multiple motions in court including a stay on evictions from brooklyn supreme court justice wayne saitta the judge ordered deitsch to maintain services and conditions in the building while the case is in court but seniors’ families say the company has ignored the order and has instead reduced services even more local officials including councilmember brad lander assemblypersons james brennan and joan millman and public advocate letitia james have been pushing for the seniors councilmember lander said in a release earlier this month that he is “appalled that the governor and the nys department of health have failed to protect our seniors from exploitation and abuse we have long known that the owner of prospect park residence is morally bankrupt and values his own profit over the health and safety of these frail elderly residents” deitsch in his own press release on wednesday said the residence “has been the subject to politically motivated stunts false characterizations and irresponsible assertions intended to alarm and provoke its residents” justice saitta will be hearing contempt charges on monday nov  at  am buyer and seller now in dispute over the deposit in a separate lawsuit deitsch who received  percent of the total sales price of the building as a deposit is now fighting in court to keep that money with eight seniors refusing to leave the residence and litigation holding up their evictions the buyers one ppw residence llc claimed that the conditions had not been met and refused to close on the property one ppw residence lcc belongs to sugar hill capital partners whose principals are alex friedman and jeremy salzberg one ppw residence contends that doh approval was not “final” because of the pending lawsuits deitsch however claims that since one ppw residence failed to close it is in default under the agreement of sale and no longer has the right to buy the property—or get its deposit back while the buyers could have written a smarter agreement that conditioned the closing on “a final nonappealable order” from the court they did not deitsch stated in court papers the agreement “should not be rewritten by this court after the fact to excuse plaintiff’s nonperformance” he stated in addition he argues various paragraphs in the agreement state that remaining residents would not be an impediment to a closing multiple wrongful death suits coming up  attorney john o’hara who is representing six people suing deitsch for wrongful death  including the family of famed brooklyn “kung fu judge” john phillips   said the state department of health “raided” the facility in  and found that deitsch was operating a nursing home without a license for years “he was told to remove  people immediately he ignored it and they all died” o’hara alleged o’hara says deitsch has also been ignoring justice saitta’s orders to reinstate service to the remaining seniors after receiving the judge’s order “he shuts off the air conditioning all summer” o’hara said the residence did not receive a license until  “the only reason he got a license at that point was to issue a discharge plan” so he could get the residents out o’hara asserted this way “he could get around the rent stabilization laws” “to evict a yearold person in landlordtenant court – good luck” o’hara explained the trial focusing on the wrongful death of judge phillips who died in  while confined against his will was set to begin thursday “he died confined to a nursing home that wasn’t a nursing home” ohara said november    am related articles seniors officials call for investigation of park slope nursing
