objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime

manager and bookkeeper the business began a slow steady decline when mabel died in  the business continued on with ac electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions a massive flood in atchison in  destroyed much of the companys merchandise prompting ac to move the business from commercial street to rented space across the river in missouri ac and mabels oldest son and middle child current company chairman james ferrell enrolled in the university of kansas in  that same year he married a yearold freshman from nearby benedictine college named elizabeth zibbie james ferrell

companyedit ferrellgas wasnt the only propane company in the nations heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late s and early s another such propane retailer was buckeye gas products company buckeye traced its roots to  when standard oil company formed the buckeye pipeline co to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately a wall street banker james ferrell met in the early s who would later become a member of the ferrellgas board of directors andy levison contacted james ferrell in  to let him know that buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated  million and asked if he

northeast market ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in  and  in the latter year the company closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major acquisitions in new jersey and rhode island the need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave james ferrell the idea to form a master limited partnership mlp in june  ferrellgas issued partnership units of ferrellgas partners lp on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol fgp employee stock ownership plan esop formededit in  investment bank goldman sachs brought james ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement the idea was for ferrell to sell his interest in ferrellgas to the companys employees in a leveraged employee stock ownership plan or esop the plans which were supported by the clinton administration helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees on july   thousands of ferrellgas employees gathered in  meetings across the united states to
