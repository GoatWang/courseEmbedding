dmd using its utrophin modulation technology summit is also advancing a highly selective antibiotic to treat cdi summits dmd utrophin modulation programme is a treatment approach independent of the underlying mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease therefore this approach has the potential to benefit the entire patient population summit has established a leadership position in the field of utrophin modulation and is developing a pipeline of first second and future generation product candidates summits most advanced utrophin modulator is ezutromid it is an orally administered small molecule that is being evaluated in patient clinical trials ezutromid has received orphan drug designation in the united states and europe summits cdi therapy is ridinilazole a novel class antibiotic that has the potential to treat the initial infection and reduce recurrent disease the key clinical issue in cdi in the recent phase  proof of concept clinical trial ridinilazole markedly reduced recurrence rates and had a statistically superior rate of sustained clinical response scr compared to vancomycin ridinilazole is now being prepared for phase  clinical trials ridinilazole has received qualified infectious disease product or qidp designation and has been granted fast track designation by the us food and drug administration fda duchenne muscular dystrophy utrophin modulation programme ezutromid phase  proof of concept trial ezutromid is progressing into an open label phase  proof of concept clinical trial the week openlabel trial called phaseout dmd is expected to enrol up to  boys ranging in age from their fifth to their tenth birthdays phaseout dmd aims to provide proof of concept for ezutromid and utrophin modulation through measurements of muscle fat infiltration as well as through measurements of utrophin protein and muscle fibre regeneration in muscle biopsies a primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging parameters related to fat infiltration and inflammation of the leg muscles functional endpoints including the sixminute walk test north star ambulatory assessment and patient reported outcomes are also being explored summit expects to commence enrolment and dosing of patients in phaseout dmd at trial sites in the united kingdom during the second quarter of  in late april  the fda cleared the investigational new drug application for ezutromid and enrolment into phaseout dmd at trial sites in the united states is expected to start during the third quarter of  the company anticipates reporting data periodically during this trial with week muscle biopsy data from the first group of patients enrolled expected to be reported in january  ezutromid phase  new formulation trial in addition to the current clinical development of ezutromid summit is conducting a phase  clinical trial in heathy volunteers and patients with dmd to evaluate two potential optimised formulations of ezutromid interim data from this trial were reported in march  the two new formulations were tested in healthy volunteers with one of these achieving an over tenfold increase in blood plasma levels compared to the current formulation of ezutromid this formulation is now being evaluated in patients with dmd data from the initial dosing period showed all patients achieved drug levels within the range believed to be necessary for potential therapeutic benefit the initial dose tested was one tenth of that required with the current formulation to achieve similar drug concentration levels as those observed in the phase b modified diet clinical trial the phase  new formulation trial is now testing a higher dose of the new formulation and firm decisions on the further development of this new formulation will await full data from the trial which are expected in the third quarter of  utrophin modulator pipeline and biomarker development as part of the companys strategy to maintain its leadership position in the field of utrophin modulation summit is advancing a pipeline of second and future generation utrophin modulators the second generation molecules are structurally related to ezutromid but are designed to have more favourable pharmaceutical properties to achieve higher plasma levels of drug future generation molecules will likely be structurally distinct from ezutromid and secondgeneration molecules in march  research was published in the peer reviewed journal plos one on the development of imaging techniques designed to quantify utrophin protein and muscle fibre regeneration in muscle biopsies from patients with dmd and becker muscular dystrophy bmd a milder form of muscular dystrophy the developed assays allowed the absolute quantification of regenerating muscle fibres within a biopsy section and for the first time the researchers observed a correlation between the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres with differences in clinical severity between patients with dmd and bmd from whom the biopsy was taken utrophin rd day summit will host a utrophin rd day on  june  in new york city the event is open to analysts institutional investors and members of the press and will feature presentations from three key opinion leaders in dmd alongside management for more information email investorssummitplccom  c difficile infection programme phase  codify clinical trial during the first quarter of the fiscal year further data were reported from a phase  proof of concept clinical trial of ridinilazole called codify codify was a doubleblind randomised activecontrol trial evaluating the efficacy of ridinilazole against the current standard of care the antibiotic vancomycin codify enrolled  patients with half the patients receiving ten days of dosing with ridinilazole mg twice a day and half the patients receiving ten days of dosing with vancomycin mg four times a day the trial was conducted in the united states and canada codify met its primary endpoint with ridinilazole achieving a scr rate of  compared to  for vancomycin noninferiority margin of  p this also represented statistical superiority of ridinilazole over vancomycin using the prespecified  confidence interval scr was defined as clinical cure based on the resolution of diarrhoea at the end of treatment and no recurrence of cdi within  days after the end of treatment the difference in scr was driven by a reduction in disease recurrence with ridinilazole having a recurrence rate of  compared to  with vancomycin cure rates at the end of treatment were  for ridinilazole compared to  for vancomycin in addition preliminary analysis of microbiome data from codify showed ridinilazole to be highly preserving of the gut microbiome patients treated with ridinilazole in codify exhibited no further damage to their microbiome during therapy with a proportion of patients showing initial evidence of recovery of key bacterial groups that play a role in protecting from cdi in contrast patients treated with vancomycin suffered substantial damage to their gut microbiome during treatment and this persisted in many patients during the day post treatment period in codify ridinilazole was generally well tolerated and the overall adverse event profiles of ridinilazole and vancomycin were comparable this primary analysis was conducted on the modified intenttotreat or mitt population that comprised patients with cdi confirmed by the presence of free toxin and these results were consistent across all treatment groups additional data from this trial are to be reported at the  asm microbe conference which will be held june  in boston us in light of these positive data from codify the company is exploring options for the future development of ridinilazole although the preference is to find a partner to advance ridinilazole to phase  through commercialisation an exploratory phase  clinical trial evaluating ridinilazole against the antibiotic fidaxomicin is currently ongoing in europe and the us the results from this open label trial are expected to help inform the design of future phase  clinical trials and the commercial positioning of ridinilazole topline results from this trial are expected in the second half of  preclinical activities in february  data published in the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy reported that ridinilazole outperformed the current standards of care vancomycin and metronidazole in preclinical studies by having a robust killing effect on c difficile that significantly reduced the level of toxins produced by the bacteria that play a major role in driving the symptoms and severity of the disease patent grant a composition of matter patent covering ridinilazole was granted by the united states patent and trademark office in april  the patent united states patent  is entitled antibacterial compounds and provides a period of exclusivity for ridinilazole in the united states until at least  december  with the possibility of patent term extension the development of ridinilazole has been financially supported by seeding drug discovery and

operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by £ million to £ million for the three months ended  april  from £ million for the three months ended  april  this increase was primarily due to increased investment in our dmd programme which increased by £ million to £ million from £ million for the three months ended  april  and a £ million increase in research and development related staffing costs driven by an increase in headcount general and administration expenses general and administration expenses increased by £ million to £ million for the three months ended  april  from £ million for the three months ended  april  this increase was primarily due to additional corporate costs of £ million associated with being a

involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our business   because we have a limited operating history have yet to attain profitable operations and will need additional financing to fund our businesses there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   our financial statements for the period from june   inception to june   have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment   we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business   we are a company with limited operations and have incurred expenses and losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition   we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the “plan of operation” section of this prospectus as of june   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us            we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from anna varlamova our president treasurer secretary and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however ms varlamova has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations   we have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future     we were incorporated on june   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail   we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have lack of experience in the marketing of consulting company and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our consulting company will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services   we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of consulting service is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful consulters operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected   some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues   some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance              we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations   we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations   because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations   due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations   because our president treasurer secretary and director will own  or more of our outstanding common stock she will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   ms varlamova our president treasurer secretary and director will own  or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly she will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of ms varlamova may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   we depend to a significant extent on a certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company   we depend entirely on our president treasurer secretary and director anna varlamova for all of our operations the loss of ms varlamova would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail ms varlamova has not been compensated for her services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that she will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of ms varlamova’s services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel   we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with her or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   because our president treasurer secretary and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations   anna varlamova our president treasurer secretary and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations she will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our president treasurer secretary and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations            our president treasurer secretary and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting   we have never operated as a public company anna varlamova our president treasurer secretary and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected   our president treasurer director and secretary is non u s resident therefore investors may have difficulty enforcing any judgments against her within the united states   our president treasurer director and secretary ms varlamova is non us resident and all or a substantial portion of her assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the united states any judgments obtained against our director including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof   we are an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to    have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive’s compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile          risks associated with this offering   because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the company’s shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on june   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock   we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that she will be able to sell any of the shares unless she is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan   the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all   our president ms varlamova does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment   ms varlamova does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us   due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering   we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board “otcbb” the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between bitmis corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment            we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from anna varlamova our president treasurer secretary and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process ms varlamova’s verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board   the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future   our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are currently issued and outstanding if we sell the  shares being offered in this offering we would have  shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the “dilution” section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus   use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten and “bestefforts” basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of   and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no assurance

our president and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process ms varlamova’s verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is nonbinding and discretionary also these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the overthecounter bulletin board ms varlamova will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by ms varlamova ms varlamova will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation            determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities   dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is calculated as the total assets of a company minus any intangible assets less all liabilities and the par value of preferred stock dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder   the historical net tangible book value as of june   was  or approximately  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of june   the following table sets forth as of june   the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders

financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties you should review the “risk factors” section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis            we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report

compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive

advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under

funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our “plan of operation” below to maintain a reporting status   our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage   to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this
