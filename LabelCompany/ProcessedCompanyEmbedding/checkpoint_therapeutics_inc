“checkpoint” a fortress biotech company is an immunooncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition development and commercialization of novel nonchemotherapy immuneenhanced combination

danafarber includes antibodies targeting programmed deathligand  “pdl” glucocorticoidinduced tnfr related protein “gitr” and carbonic anhydrase ix “caix” together the “danafarber antibodies” we plan to develop these novel immunooncology and checkpoint inhibitor antibodies on their own and in combination with each other as published literature suggests that combinations of these targets may work synergistically together we expect to submit investigational new drug “ind” applications for our antipdl antibody in  and our antigitr and anticaix antibodies in  we have also licensed and are developing three oral targeted anticancer therapies consisting of an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor “egfr” mutations an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal “bet” protein brd

programmed cell death protein  “pd” pd and its ligand pdl are checkpoints of immune activation and play a very important role in negative regulation of tcell effector function and proliferation physiological interaction between these molecules inhibits immune activation to prevent autoimmunity and to induce selftolerance many different cancers take advantage of this pathway by expressing pdl and triggering negative signaling in pdexpressing tumor reactive tcells thus blocking antitumor tcell immune response numerous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that antibodies blocking interaction of pd with its ligands or those blocking interaction of pdl alone with pd can augment antitumor tcell responses and lead to complete and lasting tumor eradication in a certain proportion of patients confirmed overall response rate “orr” in the us food and drug administration “fda” labels for the approved pd blocking antibodies was cited in the  range based on clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma potent therapeutic antitumor responses due to blocking of pdpdl interaction has been demonstrated in patients with melanoma renal cell carcinoma “rcc” and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma “nsclc” we plan to develop an antipdl antibody for oncology indications including but not limited to the treatment of patients with nsclc and rcc in march of  we entered into a partnership agreement to codevelop an antipdl antibody for hematological oncological indications with tg therapeutics inc “tgtx” we believe that an antipdl antibody has the potential to be effective in many oncological indications as a mono therapy or in combination with other antitumor immune response potentiating compounds and other targeted therapies we licensed the exclusive

generation covalent inhibitor against selective mutations of egfr activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of egfr are found in approximately  of patients with advanced nsclc compared to chemotherapy first generation egfr inhibitors significantly improved orr and progression free survival in previously untreated nsclc patients carrying egfr mutations however tumor progression could develop due to resistance mutations often within months of treatment with first generation egfr inhibitors the egfr tm “gatekeeper” mutation is the most common resistant mutation found in patients treated with first generation egfr inhibitors the mutation decreases the affinity of first generation inhibitors to egfr kinase domain rendering the drugs ineffective second generation egfr inhibitors have improved in vitro potency against the tm mutation but have not provided meaningful benefits in nsclc patients due to toxicity from inhibition of the wildtype egfr activities the third generation egfr inhibitors are designed to be highly selective against the tm mutation while sparing wildtype egfr thereby improving tolerability and safety profiles in clinical studies third generation egfr inhibitors have demonstrated robust response in secondline nsclc patients carrying the tm mutations with an orr of up to  to  in addition some of the third generation inhibitors are also active against activating egfr mutations seen in firstline nsclc patients such as lr and del  and have shown efficacy in monotherapy studies we plan to develop ck for oncology indications including but not
