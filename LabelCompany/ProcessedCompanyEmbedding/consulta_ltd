expert witness   our services  in brief   there are several statutes regulations and best practice obligations on anyone making vertical transportation equipment available for use the dutyholder whether it be a building owner or manager dependent on the type of equipment and the premises   these include the requirement for having your equipment regularly inspected and certified by competent personnel you keeping a documented record and acting on the recommendations raised during said inspections and to have said equipment regularly maintained to the appropriate standard to ensure the safety of users   your obligations are covered by not exhaustively   the health  safety at work act loler puwer safed lg supplementary testing the accessibility act  formerly dda the machinery directive given the number of regulations and the fact that they are often interdependent it is easy to see how many dutyholders are unsure as to whether they are complying and what they need to do to ensure that they are   at consultalift ltd we have  years of industry experience and keep ourselves up to date with latest developments and changes to regulations   we can carry out an audit and thereafter provide guidance to ensure that you are compliant with your responsibilities compliance your lifts and escalators not only have a direct effect on your business in moving your workforce efficiently in a comfortable and timely manner  but are also often the first impression clients have of your business when visiting your organisation   as your equipment ages component parts wear at different rates dependent on the traffic and usage and quite often this can be resolved by partial modernisation which deals specifically with those components rather than replacement of the entire installation   it is possible on certain types of maintenance contract that the client will have paid over a number of years of repetitive callouts for the cost of a major or full refurbishment or complete replacement of the installation whilst suffering from extended downtime that could all be avoided by taking the appropriate action and investing in the replacement of the correct parts of the installtion at the appropriate time   there is also a fine balance dependent on various circumstances and factors which also mean that sometimes repeated partial modernisations during the lifespan of the installation are less cost effective in the long run than premature complete replacement   given that dependent on the type of maintenance contract  making continuing running repairs to failing equipment could in the long term increase the total cost of ownership exponentially to your detriment and beyond the original cost of replacement the engagement of a reputable experienced lift consultant to give independent advice and recommendations based upon life expectancy and lifecycle costs puts you the client back in the driving seat and ensures that your investment is protected and correctly and efficiently targetted saving you money over the expected lifespan of the equipment modernisation at consultalift ltd we utilise our  years of industry experience to assist you and specialise in carrying out the following   condition surveys and reports including component life expectancy dilapidation surveys and reports health  safety surveys and reports portfolio condition reporting and investment strategy tailored modernisation specifications  competitive tendering analysis and contractor selection project progress and management project acceptance inspections defects liability period inspections​ a new lift or escalator installation is a major capital investment necessitating the requirement for thorough planning research and design in order to ensure that it is not only both fit for the purpose it is intended but also continues to give reliable service for the maximum possible time and thus safeguard and maximise your initial investment   whether in a completely new build or in a repurposed existing buildingbe it a completely new installation or the replacement of an existing one there are numerous factors to consider from the outset such as   will the building occupancy be served adequately to accepted standards by the planned amount and type of lifts postproject   is a like for like replacement the most efficient way forward or is there another solution which may free up space in my building and or reduce costs and improve reliability   are the lifts being recommended to me    fit for the usage they are intended for of sufficient quality and with a known spares supply chain being installed to a price rather than a suitable specification  open protocol to ensure freedom of selection of maintenance contractor in future​ compliant with current regulations and are any building or planning issues to consider or any deviations or additional permissions   to be applied for ​we are able to assist you with all the above considerations we  keep ourselves up to date with technological developments as well as maintaining a list of approved manufacturers and contractors who we assess and audit over several projects and installations in order to ensure that our recommendations are relevant and suitable for your particular application at consultalift ltd we utilise our  years of industry experience to assist you and

and contractor selection project progress inspections and project management project acceptance inspections defects liability period inspections ​ new installations the  appropriate level standard and frequency of maintenance is both a legal requirement  and also best practice covered by several items of legislation and recommendations   as the dutyholder defined as any person or organisation making vertical transport equipment or machinery available for use or the management thereof  it is incumbent on you to ensure the ongoing maintenance and  safety of the installation and that of its passengers  users   aside from compliance with the above there are also several factors for you to consider such as   is maintenance being carried out to the appropriate standard and frequency by my existing contractor am i getting best value in terms of the type of contract and inclusionsexclusions therein is my contractor responsive and promptly available when i need them am i sure that my lift contractor is acting appropriately and in a timely manner on recommendations and requirements highlighted in my thorough examination reports often referred to as insurance inspections  im getting what seems to be an inordinate amount of breakdowns is this due to the age and wear of the equipment is this normal and what can i do about it am i being supplied with and keeping sufficient records of maintenance visits callouts inspections and certification to satisfy the legal requirements and my obligations can i get an overview of all the equipment in my portfolio in one easily accessible and understandable format in order to assist me in making the right decisions ​ im being told that my equipment is obsolete what now ​we are able to assist you with all the above considerations and also

particular application at consultalift ltd we utilise our  years of industry experience to assist you and specialise in carrying out the following   maintenance audits review of existing maintenance

especially over time that legislation and standards change and are improved upon   you may also be in the process of considering a modernisation to your lifts in which case you will want to ensure that the package being proposed will meet the current requirements we often find especially with partial modernisations that the client has not been fully advised of items which may be central to health  safety and which have not been included within the proposed project and which if included would be both more costeffective to carry out as part of the modernisation and also ensure that the modernised lift is fully compliant    unless we are already acting on your behalf in which case weve got this covered for you in designing the project and producing the specification you would benefit from engaging us to carry out a health  safety inspection to ensure that your intended works comply with en and other standards   are you about to take over a new building perhaps on a repair  replace

we can carry out full accessibility act   surveys to ensure you are compliant have an ongoing project and perhaps not engaged a consultant and are now finding that the works are stalling or perhaps you wish to ensure that the application for payment from your contractor equates to actual progress on site   engaging us to carry out a works progress inspection will give you peace of mind   coming to the end of a project and want to ensure that the works are to the specification or proposals given at the outset by your contractor and meet regulations   our works acceptance and witness test inspections will safeguard your investment   is your warranty period usually  years about to end   we can attend to carry out a full dlp inspection to ensure that the equipment is still functioning correctly before your warranty expires inspections   although it is advisable and beneficial to employ a lift consultant at the outset of the design process in practice there may be circumstances for various reasons where this may not have been the case clients regularly approach us part way through their projects to assist and help realign the works to their original intentions and ensure a successful outcome   we not only offer  a wide range of consultancy services from turn key project consultancy to individual elements of the project which may benefit from consultancy depending on what stage of the process we are engaged at but also a number of additional beneficial services which are worth considering   among these are   contract administration  including contract
