quotes provided by interactive data fundamental company data provided by morningstar updated daily gf chat  i factual setting henry f spaloss for plaintiff appellee arthur o gormley iii and gormley  kaklamanos pc nashua nh on brief before considering these arguments we briefly describe the standards of review to be employed in this case as to the district courts denial of plaintiffs motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the standard of review is the same as for a denial of a motion for directed verdict we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and determine whether there are facts and inferences reasonably drawn from those facts which lead to but one conclusionthat there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiffs case fact concerts inc v city of newport  fd  6 st cir98 vacated on other grounds  us   sct 8  ledd 66 98 with regard to the courts denial of defendants new trial motion we will reverse only if defendants can show that the verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice  jordan v united states lines inc 8 fd 8 9 st cir98 quoting lakin v daniel marr  son co  fd   st cir98 the following facts were adduced at trial plaintiff mayo is a mechanical engineer with considerable experience in the field of hydroelectric power in january 98 he met with defendant ryan and his associate a gail staker to discuss potential participation in the formation of a new corporation for the ownership and development of hydroelectric energy facilities and related activities app8 mayo testified that ryan through his venture capital company schooner sought to fund a study of potential hydroelectric sites in which the new corporation to be known as continental hydro corporation continental could acquire an interest mayo described that ryan for investment purposes needed to get a quick fix on the largest possible number of hydroelectric sites that could be put into negotiation for acquisition app defendants begin by challenging the district courts denial of their motion for judgment nov on the ground that the jurys verdict was not supported by the evidence they correctly note that the only evidence of the oral contract claimed by mayo is his own trial testimony mayo offered no corroborating witnesses nor did he introduce any documentary evidence in support of his claim these facts alone however do not require the entry of judgment nov so long as mayos testimony and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn from it support the jurys conclusion
