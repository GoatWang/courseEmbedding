extracts inc a flavor and extract supplier in pennsylvania the creation of flavor samples and product sales take place in creative flavor’s irvine office while the shank’s plant and a plant in cincinnati ohio handle manufacturing fischler recently spoke with the register about the company’s creations q why did shank’s extracts establish creative flavor concepts ashank’s is really wellknown east of the mississippi but it does not have a big play on the west coast creative flavor gave the company a venue into the area and into a different segment of the market shank’s is a major extractor of vanilla but vanilla is much more commoditized creative flavor concepts’ flavors are not a commodity if you like our chocolate you can’t just go out to a grocery store and buy it q what makes your product unique awe are unique in that all of our products are kosher we also offer organiccertified products this is fastgrowing trend in the food industry many are switching from natural to organic q what does being kosher and organiccertified entail aour products are koshercertified by the orthodox union we submit our formula to them without measurements they review them and say “yes you can do that” the process to make a product organic is more complicated there are strictly defined organic standards that the product must meet to be certified every ingredient has tons of data sheets attached to it q what makes something a “natural” flavor anatural flavors come from products that occur in nature for example when we make a natural lemon flavor we are saying that all of the ingredients are natural to lemon – their source is lemon our focus is on natural but some of our products are offered as a combination of natural and artificial q how long does it take to sell a flavor ait can take nine to  months to sell a flavor there is a lot of back and forth that goes on with clients to get the flavor right sometimes we work feverishly on a flavor and then a client may decide to drop the product the sample flavor that we create can still be used for other clients though q are clients pretty specific in their flavor requests a about 0 percent have specific requests other times they may just request strawberry we have over  strawberry flavors so we have to ask if they want it to taste like jam or a ripe strawberry q what is your favorite flavor ai like maples and caramels contact the writer 99 or ysanchezocregistercom get the latest news delivered daily subscribe follow us facebook twitter instagram rss most popular disneyland’s river rides and railroad open
