the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest interest rate risk as interest rates rise the value of fixedincome securities held by the fund are likely to decrease securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations creditdefault risk issuers or guarantors of debt instruments or the counterparty to a repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest andor principal payments or otherwise honor its obligations debt instruments are subject to varying degrees of credit risk which may be reflected in credit ratings securities issued by the us government generally have less credit risk than debt securities of nongovernment issuers however securities issued by certain us government agencies are not necessarily backed by the full faith and credit of the us government credit rating downgrades and defaults failure to make interest or principal payment may potentially reduce the fund’s income and share price highyield securities risk high yield securities generally offer a higher current yield than that available from higher grade issues but typically involve greater risk securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” the ability of issuers of high yield securities to make timely payments of interest and principal may be adversely impacted by adverse changes in general economic conditions changes in the financial condition of the issuers and price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates asset class risk the bonds in the fund’s portfolio may underperform the returns of other bonds or indexes that track other industries markets asset classes or sectors call riskprepayment risk during periods of falling interest rates an issuer of a callable bond may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in the fund’s having to reinvest proceeds at lower interest rates resulting in a decline in the fund’s income extension risk an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation later than expected this may happen when there is a rise in interest rates under these circumstances the value of the obligation will decrease and the fund’s performance may suffer from its inability to invest in higher yielding securities income risk falling interest rates may cause the fund’s income to decline liquidity risk liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell if the fund invests in illiquid securities or securities that become illiquid fund returns may be reduced because the fund may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price declining yield risk during the final year of the fund’s operations as the bonds held by the fund mature and the fund’s portfolio transitions to cash and cash equivalents the fund’s yield will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash equivalents and thus may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the fund andor prevailing yields for bonds in the market fluctuation of yield and liquidation amount risk the fund unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity will make distributions of income that vary over time unlike a direct investment in bonds the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment for example at times during the fund’s existence it may make distributions at a greater or lesser rate than the coupon payments received on the fund’s portfolio which will result in the fund returning a lesser or greater amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case the rate of fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the fund relative to a direct investment in corporate bonds if the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the fund’s termination is higher or lower than your cost basis you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes concentration risk if the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly in such event the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries consumer staples sector risk companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences and production spending in addition companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of demand for and prices

awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

this fund scores average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other
