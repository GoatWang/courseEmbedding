the company  altai skis altai skis a network of sites for altai skis ☰ navigation home  about us  the company the company altai skis was conceived by nils larsen and francois sylvain in  we both had extensive experience in the ski industry and had worked together designing nordic and backcountry skis for over ten years we felt there was a great potential for skis designed for what we like to call ‘pocket backcountry’ the skiing many skiers have ready access to close to where they live in both quebec francois’ home and ne washington nils’ home skiing out the back door or close to it offers us excellent and easy access to the winter world we set to work on new designs with the goal of creating easy to use and accessible gear to match the often overlooked skiing possibilities hiding in plain view nils has been working on a documentary project on indigenous skiers in the remote altai mountains of northern asia since  the ski traditions in the area date back thousands of years possibly to the origins of skiing the skiers in the altai still use one ski design for all their skiing whether it’s a short trip to feed their livestock over the hill to visit a neighbor or a twoweek hunting expedition deep into the rugged mountains all skiing in the altai is ‘backcountry’ this was the inspiration for altai skis it defines the spirit of our company and it will drive our designs into the

features legendary telemarkers nils larsen aug  • features • madsen nils in the sierras circa  photo nils larsen collection lifting the sport an inside look at telemarker nils larsen  nils larsen’s last official title for defunct telemark ski company karhu was “minister of ski culture” while his business card might have caused chuckles it sums up his contributions to both the manufacturer and sport of telemarking from producing some of the earliest telemarkspecific movies ever—including beyond the groomed freedom of the heels and big mountain little skier—to hosting instructional clinics and spending  years building the karhu brand into a telltale symbol of telemarking larsen’s contributions to the sport are second perhaps only to mother nature’s and they extend far beyond what he’s brought to the silver screen “i love to teach” says larsen  of curlew washington at one point he was the lead psia telemark examiner in the entire northwest “it’s a very rewarding thing to do” if it’s rewarding for him it’s even more so for his students “he has a lowkey laidback unintimidating style that makes him an especially effective instructor” says author product designer and fellow teacher paul parker “it reflects the balance in his personality— extremely competent yet relaxed and unassuming” while he has touched people through his clinics he’s also done so through products after running the backcountry store highland nordic in curlew wa for six years he jumped to karhu in  and never looked back “it was my favorite backcountry brand” he says adding that he handled everything from marketing to product development he holds a special place in his heart for the company’s jak bc and xcd lines for their light weight and quickness and in the case of the xcd its ability “to blur the boundaries between up and down” after running into tough times the rights to the karhu ski line were sold to k in  with the company dropping the line in favor of its other backcountry offerings in  “i don’t think k ever really understood the karhu dna” says larsen “it had a strong niche but it wasn’t necessarily a big one and they didn’t quite know how to handle it” by then however larsen already had his hands full working on his fourth film in  he ventured to the altai mountains of northwest china with proven travel partners dave waag and naheed henderson who had been to the region before to document the centuriesold use of skis in skiing in the shadow of genghis khan “the formula for ski movies seems a bit stale” he says “i guess i’m a bit jaded about what i want to see” but he’s also accepted that there is a new breed of freeheeler bucking conventional norms “as i started skiing with some of these younger guys in films i realized that some of them can ski the pants off any psia skier” he says “it caused me to revisit what good skiing was and broaden my views” gear a lot of which he helped develop plays a big part in this “when you look at gear now it’s almost like there’s an artificial separation between telemarking and other disciplines” he says “it’s more about your abilities than what kind of gear you’re on” he feels that new technology like ntn blurs the lines even more “i like to joke that it’s a plot launched by alpine companies to get rid of telemarking altogether” he says still ever the freeheel fan and loving life in the hamlet of curlew he’s always eyeing a new line both on the mountain and in life and for him both of these are now more frequently coming in the backcountry “if you look at the entire ski category all the growth is in backcountry now” he says “and there’s a reason for that” future projects include continuing his instructional offerings—this summer he conducted several clinics at mt hood—as well as several “undisclosed” new product developments that he’s keeping close to his avalanche harness while he’s not planning to produce any more mainstream telemark flicks he’s happy leaving that to the likes of powderwhores he is continuing his documentation of routes in the altai and skiing’s origins after winning the film award from the international ski history association for in the shadow he returned last year to capture more highdefinition footage and is entertaining a sequel as well as a book the rest of us meanwhile should look back uphill and appreciate the tracks he laid while we’re lifting our heels we can thank larsen minister of ski culture for moving the sport along   this originally appeared in ts  thoughts on “legendary telemarkers nils larsen” hi started telemark skiing at about
