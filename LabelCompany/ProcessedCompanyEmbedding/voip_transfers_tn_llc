we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt including secured debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business we have a significant amount of debt and may subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments incur additional debt in the future as of june   the total principal amount of debt and intercompany loans of the parent guarantor and its subsidiaries as adjusted for the consummation of the exchange offer would have totaled approximately  billion our significant amount of debt could have consequences such as        impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates or at all        make us vulnerable to interest rate increases because approximately  of borrowings of the parent guarantor and its subsidiaries as of june   including the effects of existing interest rate swaps as adjusted for the consummation of the exchange offer would have been and may continue to be subject to variable rates of interest        expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt particularly our bank debt with

expenditures and other general corporate expenses        limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business the cable and telecommunications industries and the economy at large        place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt and        adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers if current debt amounts increase the related risks that we now face will intensify the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business our liquidity and our results of operations these covenants restrict among other things our and our subsidiaries ability to        incur additional debt        repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt    table of contents      issue equity        make certain investments or acquisitions        pay dividends or make other distributions        dispose of assets or merge        enter into related party transactions and        grant liens and pledge assets additionally the credit agreement governing the charter operating credit facilities the credit agreement requires charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities not otherwise waived or amended could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in addition the secured lenders under the credit agreement could foreclose on their collateral which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries and exercise other rights of secured creditors we depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations capital expenditures and ongoing operations we are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations capital expenditures and ongoing operations our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access by dividend or otherwise to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors including        our ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations by offering video internet voice advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers to adequately meet the customer experience demands in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures        the impact of competition from other market participants including but not limited to

technologies including our cloudbased user interface spectrum guide® and downloadable security for settop boxes and        the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions some of these factors are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources we may not be able to service and repay our debt operate our business respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs    table of contents the notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions while our other outstanding indebtedness may have some or all of these limitations the indenture that will govern the notes does not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations nor does it limit our ability to make investments to pay dividends and distributions to our shareholders to sell certain assets or to enter into change of control transactions additionally the indenture that will govern the notes contains only certain limitations on our ability to incur liens however these limitations are subject to important exceptions see description of notescertain covenantslimitation on liens the notes and each note guarantee are structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of nonguarantor subsidiaries of charter operating substantially all of charter operatings subsidiaries guarantee the notes however the notes are structurally subordinated to claims against any subsidiary of charter operating that does not guarantee the notes generally claims of creditors of a nonguarantor subsidiary including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders if any of the subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity including claims by holders of the notes under the note guarantees in the event of any foreclosure dissolution winding up liquidation administration reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our nonguarantor subsidiaries holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity as a shareholder as such the notes and each note guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors including trade creditors and preference shareholders if any of charter operatings nonguarantor subsidiaries holders of the notes will not control decisions regarding collateral the rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral are subject to an intercreditor agreement the intercreditor agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on a firstpriority basis including the obligations under the credit agreement under the intercreditor agreement the applicable authorized representative which is initially the administrative agent under the credit agreement controls substantially all matters related to the collateral securing the notes pursuant to the terms of the intercreditor agreement see description of notescollateralintercreditor arrangements the applicable authorized representative may in connection with an enforcement action dispose of release or foreclose on or take other actions with respect to the collateral including amendments of and waivers under the security documents with which holders of the notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the notes even after a default under the notes to the extent collateral is released from the lien securing the obligations under the credit agreement in connection with foreclosure or enforcement action even if a default under the notes exists liens securing the notes will also be released if the liens on any collateral securing the obligations under the credit agreement are released the liens on such collateral securing the obligations under the notes will also be released to the extent that the liens on such collateral securing all other equally and ratably secured indebtedness will also be released in addition the intercreditor agreement generally provides that the applicable authorized representative may change waive modify or vary the security documents governing such liens without the consent of the holders of the notes except under certain limited circumstances and that the security documents governing the liens securing the notes will be automatically changed waived and modified in the same manner subject to certain limitations and exceptions rights of the holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain collateral acquired in the future applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest such as real property equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds can only be perfected at    table of contents the time such property and rights are acquired and identified the trustee or the collateral agent may not monitor or we may not inform the trustee or the collateral agent of the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute collateral and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral the collateral agent for the notes has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the notes against third parties in addition as described further herein even if the liens on collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances see risks related to our indebtedness the exchange offer and the new notesany future pledge of collateral provided after the notes are issued might be avoided by a trustee in bankruptcy the ability of the collateral agent to realize upon the capital stock securing the notes will be automatically limited to the extent the pledge of such capital stock would require the filing with the sec of separate financial statements for any of our subsidiaries under rule  of regulation sx if the par value book value as carried by us or market value whichever is greatest of the capital stock of any subsidiary pledged as part of the collateral is greater than or equal to  of the aggregate principal amount of any class of debt securities then outstanding that are then registered or being registered such subsidiary would be required to provide separate financial statements to the sec as a result the indenture and the related security documents provide that to the extent that separate financial statements of any of our subsidiaries would be required by the rules of the sec due to the fact that such subsidiarys capital stock secures the notes of a series or any other series of equally and ratably secured indebtedness that is in the form of debt securities including each series of the twc llc notes and debentures and the twce debentures the pledge of such capital stock constituting collateral securing the notes and the equally and ratably secured indebtedness will automatically be limited such that the value of the portion of such capital stock that the holders of the notes may realize upon will in the aggregate at no time equal or exceed  of the aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding class of debt securities registered with the sec with each series of the notes and each series of the twc llc notes and debentures and the twce debentures constituting a separate class for such purpose see description of notescollateralexcluded property as a result holders of the notes could lose the benefit of a portion or all of the security interest securing the notes in the capital stock or other securities of those subsidiaries it may be more difficult costly and timeconsuming for the collateral agent to foreclose on the assets of a subsidiary than to foreclose on its capital stock or other securities so the proceeds realized upon any such foreclosure could be significantly less than those that would have been received upon any sale of the capital stock or other securities of such subsidiary certain assets are excluded from the collateral securing the notes certain assets are excluded from the collateral securing the notes as described under description of notescollateralexcluded property in addition no assets of any of our nonguarantor subsidiaries including any capital stock owned by any such subsidiary will constitute collateral securing the notes furthermore applicable law requires that a security interest in tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party the liens on the collateral securing the notes may not be perfected if the collateral agent for the notes does not or is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens it may be difficult to realize the value of the fcc license rights pledged to secure the notes the issuers and the subsidiary guarantors cable and telecommunication license rights constitute part of the collateral that secures the notes and the related note guarantees the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on such collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes may be subject to prior approval by the federal communications commission the fcc and other governmental authorities in particular the collateral agent will not be legally permitted to exercise any rights with respect to the fcc license rights upon the    table of contents occurrence of an event of default if such action would constitute or result in any assignment of any fcc license or any other form of change of control whether as a matter of law or fact of the entity holding any fcc license lease unless any necessary prior approval of the fcc is obtained there can be no assurance that any such required approval can be obtained on a timely basis or at all this requirement may limit the number of potential bidders for the fcc license rights in any foreclosure and may delay sale either of which events may have a material adverse effect on the sale price of the fcc license rights therefore the practical value of realizing on the fcc license rights may without the appropriate consents prior approval of the fcc and related filings be limited the collateral is subject to casualty risks although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses there are certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in whole or in part as a result it is possible that the insurance proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss if there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations including the notes we will in most cases have control over the collateral and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the pool of assets securing the notes and the note guarantees the security documents allow us to remain in possession of retain exclusive control over freely operate and collect invest and dispose of any income from the collateral securing the notes and the note guarantees for example so long as no default or event of default under the indenture governing the notes would result therefrom we may among other things without any release or consent by the trustee or the collateral agent conduct ordinary course activities with respect to collateral such as selling factoring abandoning or otherwise disposing of collateral and making ordinary course cash payments including repayments of indebtedness there are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the notes will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the trustee or the collateral agent under various circumstances collateral securing the notes will be released automatically including        a sale transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture        with respect to collateral held by a guarantor upon the release of such guarantor from its note guarantee        with respect to collateral that is capital stock upon the dissolution of the issuer of such capital stock in accordance with the indenture        with respect to the collateral upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to that collateral directed by the lenders under the credit agreement or holders of other first lien obligations during any period that such representatives control actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the intercreditor agreement and        in whole upon a collateral release event as defined in the description of notes see description of notescollateralrelease the imposition of certain permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the collateral the collateral securing the notes may also be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes whether arising on or after the date the notes were originally issued the existence of any permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the collateral that could be realized by the holders of the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral in addition the imposition of certain permitted liens will cause the relevant assets to become excluded property which will not secure the notes or the note guarantees see description of notescollateralexcluded property for the definition of excluded property    table of contents each note guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability each subsidiary guarantor guarantees the payment of the notes on a first lien senior secured basis each note guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor provides the relevant holders of the notes with a direct claim against such subsidiary guarantor however the indenture governing the notes provides that each note guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor without rendering the relevant note guarantee as it relates to that guarantor voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law and enforcement of each note guarantee is subject to certain generally available defenses enforcement of any of the note guarantees against any guarantor is subject to certain defenses available to guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit fraudulent conveyance or transfer voidable preference insolvency or bankruptcy challenges financial assistance preservation of share capital thin capitalization capital maintenance or similar laws regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally if one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable a guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its note guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in new york courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any note guarantee against any guarantor in general under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws a court could i avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a guarantors obligations under its note guarantee andor the related security interest ii direct that the holders of the notes return any amounts paid under a note guarantee to the relevant guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such guarantors creditors or iii take other action that is detrimental to you typically if the court found that        the relevant note guarantee and the related security interest if applicable was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another hinder delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the guarantor or in certain jurisdictions when the granting of the note guarantee or related security interest if applicable has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant note guarantee and related security interest if applicable        the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant note guarantee and related security interest if applicable and the guarantor was i insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant note guarantee or related security interest if applicable ii undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant note guarantee or iii intended to incur or believed that it would incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity        the relevant note guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the guarantor or        the amount paid or payable under the relevant note guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law these or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee and related security interests granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture which may also potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances see risks related to our indebtedness the exchange offer and the new notesany future pledge of collateral or note guarantee provided after the notes are issued might be avoided by a trustee in bankruptcy as a general matter value is given for a transfer or an obligation if in exchange for the transfer or obligation property is transferred or antecedent debt is secured or satisfied a court would likely find that a    table of contents guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its note guarantee or the related security interest if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred such that we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or that regardless of method of valuation a court would not determine that a guarantor was insolvent on that date or that a court would not determine regardless of whether or not a guarantor was insolvent on the date its note guarantee or related security interest was issued that payments to holders of the notes constituted preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds the liability of each guarantor under its note guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such note guarantee not constituting a preference fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside however there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each guarantor moreover in a florida bankruptcy case which was reversed by a district court on other grounds and then reinstated by the applicable circuit court of appeals this kind of provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees there is a possibility that the entire note guarantee may be set aside in which case the entire liability may be extinguished if a court decided that a note guarantee or the related security interest if applicable was a preference fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such note guarantee or held it unenforceable for any other reason you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant guarantor andor the benefit of the corresponding underlying collateral and would be a creditor solely of the issuers and if applicable of any other guarantor under the relevant note guarantee which has not been declared void in the event that any note guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor is invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or to the extent the agreed limitation of the note guarantee obligations apply the notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable subsidiary guarantor and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the notes or any note guarantee is found to be a preference fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the notes any future pledge of collateral or note guarantee provided after the notes are issued might be avoided by a trustee in bankruptcy the indenture and the related security documents will require us to grant liens on certain assets that we or any subsidiary guarantor acquires any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the collateral agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes might be avoidable by the grantor as debtorin possession or by its trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur for instance if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within  days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an insider under the us bankruptcy code and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under chapter  of the us bankruptcy code then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness thus in any bankruptcy proceedings commenced within  days of lien perfection a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date accordingly if we or any subsidiary guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the outstanding notes and any liens granted with respect to the notes or the note guarantees had been perfected less than  days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding the liens securing the notes or the note guarantees may be particularly subject to challenge as a    table of contents result of having been delivered after the issue date even if any liens granted on the issue date of the notes were not subject to any such challenge to the extent that such challenge succeeded the holders of the notes would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide rights of the holders of the notes in the collateral securing the notes may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings and the holders of the notes may not be entitled to postpetition interest in any bankruptcy proceeding the right of the collateral agent for the notes to foreclose upon repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the notes and the note guarantees of the subsidiary guarantors upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral under the us bankruptcy code pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing a secured creditor such as the collateral agent for the notes is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor without prior bankruptcy court approval which may not be given under the circumstances moreover bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral and the proceeds products rents or profits of the collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection the meaning of the term adequate protection may vary according to circumstances but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditors interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case a bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures in view of the lack of a precise definition of the term adequate protection and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court it is impossible to predict whether any payments under the notes could be made following commencement of or during a bankruptcy case or the length of any potential delay in making any such payments postpetition whether or when the collateral agent could foreclose upon repossess or dispose of the collateral or whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of adequate protection furthermore in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes the holders of the notes would have undersecured claims as to the difference federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of postpetition interest costs expenses and attorneys fees for undersecured claims during the debtors bankruptcy case other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would be among other things a lack of entitlement to receive other adequate protection under federal bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the notes in addition if any payments of postpetition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the notes the intercreditor agreement also contains provisions restricting the holders of the notes from filing certain objections in any future bankruptcy to among other things a proposed debtorinpossession financing that satisfied various terms and conditions charter operating and cco holdings are holding companies and will depend on subsidiaries including nonguarantor subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations under the notes and cco holdings note guarantee as holding companies cco holdings and charter operating conduct substantially all of their operations through their direct and indirect subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets    table of contents consequently the principal source of cash to pay the obligations of charter operating under the notes and of cco holdings under its note guarantee is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable charter operating and cco holdings to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit the ability of charter operating and cco holdings to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indentures governing certain of our existing notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event charter operating or cco holdings does not receive distributions from our subsidiaries charter operating may be unable to make required payments under the notes and cco holdings may be unable to make required payments under its note guarantee changes in our credit rating could adversely affect the market price or liquidity of the notes credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow including us the credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry we cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the notes a negative change in our ratings could have an adverse effect on the price of the notes if you do not exchange your original notes for new notes you will continue to have restrictions on your ability to resell them the original notes were not offered and sold in a transaction registered under the securities act or under the securities laws of any state and may not be resold offered for resale or otherwise transferred unless they are subsequently registered or resold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws if you do not exchange your original notes for

unless you resell them offer to resell them or otherwise transfer them under an exemption from the registration requirements of or in a transaction not subject to the securities act in addition once the exchange offer has terminated we will no longer be under an obligation to exchange the original notes in a transaction registered under the securities act except in the limited circumstances provided in the exchange and registration rights agreement in addition upon consummation of the exchange offer the aggregate principal amount of original notes will be reduced by the amount of original notes exchanged securities with a smaller outstanding principal amount available for trading or float generally command a lower price than do comparable securities with a greater float therefore the market price for original notes that are not submitted for exchange or not accepted by us may be adversely affected a reduced float may also make the trading prices of any original notes that are not exchanged more volatile there is currently no public market for the notes and there is no guarantee that an active trading market for the notes may develop the failure of a market to develop for the notes could adversely affect the liquidity and value of the notes there is currently no established public trading market for the original notes or the new notes we do not intend to apply for listing of any series of the new notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of any series of the new notes on any automated dealer quotation system a market may not develop for the new notes and if a market does develop it may not be sufficiently liquid for your purposes if an active liquid market does not develop for the new notes the market price and liquidity of each series of the new notes may be adversely affected if any series of the new notes are traded after their initial issuance they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price    table of contents the liquidity of the trading market if any and future trading prices of the original notes and the new notes will depend on many factors including among other things prevailing interest rates our operating results financial performance and prospects the market for similar securities and the overall securities market and may be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in these factors the market for the notes may be subject to disruptions that could have a negative effect on the holders of the notes regardless of our operating results financial performance or prospects the exchange offer may be cancelled or delayed we have reserved the right to terminate or withdraw the exchange offer including solely in respect of one or more series of the original notes in our sole discretion

fluctuations based on factors that include among others the condition of the issuers and the guarantors industry the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale general economic conditions the

guarantors prior to the collateral agent having repossessed and disposed of the collateral upon the commencement of a case for relief under the bankruptcy code a secured creditor such as the trustee is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case or from disposing of security repossessed from the debtor without bankruptcy court approval in view of the broad equitable powers of a us bankruptcy court it is impossible to predict how long payments under the notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case whether or when the collateral agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether or to what extent holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral the bankruptcy code permits only the payment andor accrual of postpetition interest costs and attorneys fees to a secured creditor during a debtors bankruptcy case

factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
