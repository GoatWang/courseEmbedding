levels of activity or achievements with that out of the way let me now turn the call over to ermanno santilli chief executive officer please go ahead ermanno ermanno santilli thanks natalya and thanks to everybody for joining the call today good morning we are pleased to report a number of important developments magnegas regarding our commercialization and cost reduction programs first i think we’ve shown that we are continuing to execute on our business strategy of increasing our industrial gas sales we achieved a  increase in revenue for the three months ending march   versus the same period last year the increase in sales came primarily from new customer accounts that we secured through our superior customer service at magnegas fuel we have also been aggressively streamlining our operations reducing our operating expenses by  versus the fourth quarter of  this is the first crucial step in our strategy to shift from an rd focused company to a profitable company we are working aggressively to cut our burn rate and this is just the beginning of many steps we have taken to give us a profitable run rate within the next couple of quarters our sga was down sequentially from the fourth quarter  and we expect the true impact of our recent cost reductions to be reflected in the coming quarters our goal in  is to achieve a selfsustained organic growth over the past  days we have put in place an aggressive strategy that contains costs the reduction of nonessential employees consultants and along with a realignment of certain personnel and sales related positions we also identified a more costeffective feedstock for magnegas which will enhance our gross margins going forward we see a clear path to profitability through organic growth in careful management of our expenses including the cost reductions of magneggas in addition to organic growth we are focused on acquiring accretive companies in the industrial gas market to rapidly scale the business and maximize profitability in addition to potential acquisitions in florida and indiana where the company already has a strong presence and existing sales force we are also seeking to penetrate new markets in the united states with a strong industrial base particularly those were renewable technology solutions such as magnegas would be well received we have identified a number of potential highquality targets the key criteria for these targets include strong existing management team a stable customer base and consistent profitability now in order to execute on the strategy we formed a new whollyowned subsidiary magnegas welding supply llc to hold essi and future industrial gas and welding acquisitions we believe the parent organization is now ready to fully focus on concrete growth plans using clearly defined acquisition strategy we believe we have the opportunity to begin systematically consolidating a meaningful position in the industrial gas space over the coming quarters and for the next several years the creation of magnegas welding supply llc is one of the many steps being undertaken by the executive team to prepare for the execution of the strategy in the nearterm turning to our equipment sales in march we announced that we successfully completed the installation of the plasmaarc gasification system at green arc in the louisiana which makes it the first unit operating outside of magnegas headquarters in the united states pursuant to the terms of the gasifier purchase agreement magnegas received a total of  in addition to recurring royalty payments we are excited to have our first historic operating system at a customer location in united states and look forward to additional sales equipment nationwide our strategy is to replicate this business model of upfront payments plus longterm high margin royalties at additional locations we also believe we have a large market opportunity in europe for our sterilization gasification and potentially cocombustion applications in january  we signed a definitive agreement for a  million sale of our proprietary gasification and sterilization systems magnesgas fuel and cylinders to a companybased in germany this transaction represents the largest sale in our company’s history in magnegas corporation’s first equipment sale in europe we have an open dialog with the german company and are discussing additional equipment sales from the future we also have significant interest from other parts of europe such as scandinavia to purchase our units in conclusion we believe this is a pivotal turning point for the company we are clearly focused towards nearterm commercial growth opportunities and away from long lead time rd projects the objective of the shift is to develop a strong cash flow positive business model we have been developing an acquisition pipeline both in the utility services and industrial gas and welding supply verticals we believe this acquisition strategy will provide a diverse and growing revenue mix added intellectual property dedicated to the utility space and significant additional human capital these resources are intended to improve probability and magnitude of our commercial opportunities for cocombustion and sterilization as well as the rapid geographic expansion of our most successful product to date magnegas at this point id like to turn the call over to our cfo scott mahoney who will review our financial performance scott mahoney thanks ermanno revenues for the first three months ended march   were  as compared to  for the same period last year this increase was primarily due to additional customers and distributors acquired through essi gross profit increased to  from  for the first quarter ending march   versus the same period in the prior year operating expenses for the first quarter ending march   were  million unchanged from  million for the same period last year however operating expenses decreased  million approximately  for the three months ended march   compared to the fourth quarter of  the primary cause for the decrease was a focus on vendor rationalization reduction in consulting and thirdparty services and overall cost control efforts we’ve also taken on additional cost cutting measures related to personnel we conducted a full review of the previous staffing model and we begun to eliminate redundant and nonessential positions this has reduced compensation expense from approximately  million on an annualized basis in the beginning of first quarter  to approximately  million on a current run rate we expect the majority of our staffing changes to take place in the second quarter of  further reducing our payroll and related compensation expenses going forward our focus thereafter will be to primarily drive revenue growth enabling our gross income to cover ongoing cash operating expenses for the organic business our goal remains to produce a stable cash flow positive business model as quickly as possible ideally no later than the end of this current year as of march   we had a cash balance of  versus  million at the end of  as of march   we had no longterm debt with the small convertible note and a mortgage on our headquarters which was relatively unchanged from the end of  last week we announced that we completed  million bridge financing and warrant exchange the bridge financing provides us additional working capital for general corporate purposes at favorable terms and the warrant exchange will help us dramatically enhance our capital structure by simplifying our existing capital structure we now have greater financial flexibility which we believe will be ultimately enhance our value for shareholders as we execute our corporate restructuring and new growth initiatives we believe we have taken the necessary steps and are successfully executing on our growth strategy and believe we now have the infrastructure in place to support our growth at this point wed like to open the call up to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from sameer joshi from rodman  renshaw please go ahead sameer joshi good morning scott good morning ermanno how are you guys ermanno santilli good morning very well thank you sameer joshi so the first question about the cost cutting efforts you are undergoing you had  million annual savings target is that correct scott mahoney no our payroll was previously at an annual run rate of  million sameer joshi got it okay and so this quarter your total opex was around  million should we expect that these levels or further costs reductions that are should be expected scott mahoney i think just two things to think about there one i think in an absolute terms were focused on driving opex substantially lower however one of things that we’ll begin to talk more and more about is some of the people that were clearly expensive on our staff technical people they were in a position because of their previous employment to where they could do things where they could take some of their cash out and converted to stock options restricted stock grants and things like that some of our consulting partners were interested in doing the same so one of the things that weve explored very carefully over the last three months as where we could not only reduce absolute costs but more importantly to our shortterm endeavors reduce our cash burn rate so one of the things that we’ll begin to highlight beginning with our second quarter q will be not only absolute ebitda but adjusted ebitda to highlight the cash burn and i think thats important for investors as we could see and focus on getting ourselves to our cash neutrality as quickly as possible i think thats imperative to show people the existing business stable and healthy organically funded and then as we grow the items we would look to raise capital going forward would ideally be to make acquisitions and drive accelerated growth hopefully that answers your question sameer joshi yes now i understand so you will be highlighting your ebitda after stockbased combination ermanno santilli yes well start to make that abundantly clear to investors going forward we think it’s going to be a key metric sameer joshi understood and above the line you also mentioned that youre using a new feedstock which is expected to reduce your growth – reduce your cost of goods your current gross margins are in the  to  range are we going to see further improvements on that or will it be around   ermanno santilli yes that’s a good question we’re only touching on the topic because we dont know exactly what the results are going to be but our prior feedstock which was soybean oil is very thick and in essence what were doing is were pumping the liquid multiple times around our units and exposing it to the arc over time that was getting thicker and thicker which meant that occasionally you have to dump that and filter and clean and do all sorts of things that obviously added cost on the feedstock that we are on right now is resulting in the same if not better gas produced but is thinner it’s still renewable and it’s functioning much much better in our unit so we fully expected to be able to demonstrate some pretty significant cost reductions in our production of magnegas in the future scott mahoney i think theres a couple of things to think about with this transition is it makes our use of labor much more efficient so it just simply put it means that we can get a lot more gas out of each manhour so it lets you get a lot more efficient about personnel staffing models how many actually are required to support the machine for the production how many actually are required to support the maintenance and the cleanup the waste its produce the various things that go into both prior production and then after production the logistics are dealing with residual waste and the production output so that not only makes the machine operation as our business much more efficient but this is a key stepping stone in making our machine increasingly marketable for potential end users it doesnt require so much functional output people working to create that output so it becomes a lot more attractive for people to consider operating as an independent operator ermanno santilli yes ultimately over the next few months we expect that this change in feedstock will be – will have a significant effect to our operations and strategically as a company as scott said the ability to easily sell these units to just about anybody sameer joshi thanks for that great explanation actually that brings me to the green arc actually installation how is that going and are they producing magnegas and are you receiving royalties already or what is the schedule for that ermanno santilli its complete the official completion of this was sent and accepted they are producing gas i think as theyre seating their local market they are not producing gas every day but theyre certainly producing it and they actually are on the new feedstock already so far theyre really happy with the operation of the unit and our team has been there several times to a system training so from our perspective its complete sameer joshi great so should we expect royalty revenues from this or the next two three four quarters ermanno santilli yes absolutely absolutely sameer joshi and just one more from me the talon order from germany there was going to be an upfront payment in the first  days has that been received or what is the scheduled for that ermanno santilli yes they have actually asked for an extension which we have provided to them the extension has a cost and so we know its not just an extension just to extend we are speaking to them daily and we’re actually working with them on other multiple opportunities in addition to speaking to them and agreeing that this new feedstock at least from the industrial gas side of it is really a game changer for their business model as well sameer joshi okay i have actually one more if you may can you just talk a little bit about the coal initiative or the coal combustion technology acquisition you have spoken about a few quarters ago ermanno santilli yes scott you want to take that scott mahoney sure so we conducted excess diligence on an opportunity at that point we are still very favorably disposed towards the action however some of the other thing that we have since dealt with were gaining items to getting any transaction done any sort of transaction involving financing acquisitions and if you take a look at the announcement we made in the last week related to warrant exchange and interim financing there is certain things that we did in those agreements that make our capital structure significantly more flexible it gives a lot more options to how we can get certain things done so that was truly a big task it’s a big achievement for us to basically give ourselves substantially more flexibility given that really this was our primary investor for the last four plus years and there are many terms and conditions in the structure that made it somewhat limiting to what kind of auction structures or options we could pursue weve now limited virtually all of those limitations and it really opens up the entire realm of options for us to evaluate going forward sameer joshi great thanks for all the color provided on this call this is really helpful thanks ermanno santilli thank you for the questions operator thank you our next question is from jim miller from hillcrest capital please go ahead unidentified analyst good morning gentlemen it looks like the – your strategy your game plan is starting to come together i could see a little bit of visibility there so congratulations ermanno santilli thanks unidentified analyst the warrant exchange rate i read up on it and ermanno just touched on it i just want to just get a better feel of what we – say a little bit more detail on that and if theres anything along those same lines going forward scott mahoney ermanno you want to fill that or let me take care of it ermanno santilli no you can take it scott mahoney yes so as im sure youre aware ive been in the job since december  and my background is ma and to capital raising one of the things that we observed fairly early on as we were evaluating the ways that we could start to really advance the process for the companys growth was that almost no matter which form of transactional structure we wish to pursue ultimately it was prohibited or limited and some actually performed by certain terms and conditions that all tied back to previous financings and essentially as long as the warrants that were in place – are in place my option is to provide solutions to the executive team the company and the board were very limited and they became pretty apparent as we evaluate our options is that the only real clear path for the company go forward would be to restructure its capital structure and give itself more options to do productive things that make people supportive of our strategy even more so than they are now and this warrants exchange was a linchpin in moving forward a lot of people wont understand the importance of it until they see subsequent opportunities come to bear but this was the first critical step and really giving us some of the ability to contemplate doing anything transformational unidentified analyst gotcha again somewhat along the same lines it seems as if you are cleaning up the capital structure and setting the company up for organic growth going forward i actually have somewhat of a two part question what do you see in terms of nearterm intermediate term catalysts along the growth from a growth perspective and also just getting a feel for just the size of the industry the addressable market just so i can get a better feel for what the picture could look like in the coming months and years ermanno santilli well the catalysts really are nearterm our continued sales increases which we are confident we will be able to achieve and continued pretty significant cost reductions that coupled with some of the acquisitions that were looking at obviously are going to be significant catalysts i think that when the market realizes that weve created magnegas is the best product in the industry the only renewable fuel in the world for metal cutting – metal working and that we succeeding and leveraging it and continuing to grow at  when the industry is growing at  i think thats going to be a pretty significant catalyst the cost reduction for me is obviously significant for the entire company as well that has been something weve been pursuing very aggressively as you can see once the shareholders in the market realizes that were trending on a track towards profitability obviously that is an enormous event for the company and for our ability to raise capital to finance and how we run our operations that would be a watershed moment for the company and were expecting to have that in  as long as we continue on this path finally technology wise as i said i think that magnegas the new feedstock will prove to be very important not just in our organic growth profitability but also in our ability to sell these units much easier than we were in the past and finally the sterilization technology which weve invested in the past in which were not really doing any more rd projects on right now apart from waiting on usda those are part of the sales to europe where were expecting that that sort of technology where would be – would find a lot of traction and successful commercially in europe as magnegas is in the us scott mahoney i think if i could add a couple things i think from my perspective i think something thats getting to connect in a series of smaller catalysts but are pretty meaningful weve done a couple things organically that are just starting to bear fruit to immediate growth initiatives in our organic business that maybe easy to overlook the first as we have launched the co business and co is fundamentally different from some of the other organic activities that we’ve had in industrial gas and welding supply probably one of the most key differences is essentially it creates a steadily growing recurring revenue model which when a small company is trying to cash flow growth that recurring nature of the revenue slowly becomes a more impactful baseline and weve had tremendous success co is a business that is heavily driven off of the leisure and travel and holiday industry and obviously where our company is based in florida we have enormous leverage against that industry and the gentleman that we brought in is extremely experienced he has deep customer relationships and hes done an excellent job getting us a toehold and ramping up that business and we expected to steadily become a meaningful component of our business to the point were you may look at a year from now and that business alone may carry our payroll for all of florida its a very understated little business but if we do a good job executing if we grow it as fast as we can within region it can become a very nice little complimentary business thats easy to overlook another major initiative thats just beginning to take hold in march we announced that we opened a fort wayne indiana location we did that because we had an existing ocean account with big three auto manufacturer that we had been selling gas to through a distributor the distributor was an acquired and we were then given the opportunity to continue to support that auto manufacturer directly through the sale of our gas and when i came aboard i looked at that opportunity and said in many other instances in florida weve taken the magnegas products used as a wedge and then began crossselling many other items into installed customer base and i asked the question and said why wouldnt we look to bring in an experienced sales person to support their relationship cross sell elevating else and then go out into the local market and drive other organic growth and thats just beginning to take place but please bear in mind that that opportunity with that big three auto manufacturer could spider web into other plants other related opportunities so were just beginning to unfold that relationship now and that could become a pretty meaningful relationship for the company quickly and we truly hope it will but these are kind of understated organic growth opportunities that can have a pretty significant impact on making the existing business stable and strong in a matter of a few quarters you couple that with what weve just done and weve set the table to give ourselves capital structure opportunities within ourselves the ability to go out and look at other things one of the things that we all agree on is the best thing we could do is not only leverage our growth opportunities in florida and in indiana but try to highlight other meaningful markets where we can either organically or through acquisitions quickly springboard into cost effective stable profitability and thats what were really trying to drive forward as fast as possible unidentified analyst all right now i appreciate that that’s tremendous just one last question i just need just maybe a little bit more visibility better understanding the  reduction in operating expenses i would say its significant and again its impressive i just want to get a feel for the comments as far as the impact being sub leader is it in the year in the quarter and what type of impact are we looking at here ermanno santilli we are definitely expecting the impact to be in the coming one two and three quarters its going to be this year for sure scott mahoney weve rationalized a lot and a lot of the costs are really being felt a lot more this quarter actually even though some of the actions were taken last quarter and as we continue to accumulate those decisions and cost cutting then its going to result in a much lower cost base than prior years unidentified analyst okay thank you so much scott mahoney thank you end of qa operator thank you this concludes the questionandanswer session i’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments ermanno santilli thank you well as you can see were continuing our strategic success with our pivot to profitability so the latest results are  increase in sales quarteroverquarter and  reduction in operating expenses our latest financing has cleaned up our cap structure and prepared magnegas to execute on a complete corporate restructuring and acquisition growth strategy and finally as weve been discussing in the coming months were looking forward to sharing with you the cumulative benefits of our cost cutting as well as more information as we receive it about magnegas and how that’s really going to be a game changer for us in respect to cost and in respect to continued penetration of the market using it as a differentiator thank you very much and

thank you natalya and thanks to everybody on the call joining us today we continued to grow our industrial gas sales and i’m pleased to report a  increase in revenue for the full year of  versus the same period last year we’re also proud that we’ve achieved a  increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of  versus the same period last year proving once again that our magnegas product is an effective differentiator in a mature commoditized industry we attribute much of this growth of our success from our magnegas product line which enables us to drive better value for our clients in a price competitive landscape for the past two years we’ve been proving out our business model of using magnegas as a wedge product this has been a critical driver of revenue growth and has allowed the company to quickly gain market share as a result magnegas has experienced a  growth rate versus an overall welding and gas supply industry market growth rate of just  to  we expect sales will continue to increase as we expand into additional locations and add new partnerships we expect sales will continue to increase as we expand into additional locations and roll these new partnerships given the growing demand for magnegas which has created a substantial backlog we’ve signed the letter of intent to purchase  additional fuel cylinders the high demand we’re experiencing is the direct result of our aggressive sales and marketing programs as well as our expanding distribution network as a result magnegas fuel continues to gain the market acceptance rapidly we’ve added a number of new customers and other large potential customers are in the testing or product procurement phase in addition our welding and gas supply distributor essi has expanded geographically to a total of five retail locations generating increased demand for magnegas as an example of our recent success the marketing program we implemented with our distributor partners in  awisco corporation attracted new customers including the new york city department of transportation which selected magnegas for metal cutting and repairs as well as the new york iron workers joint apprentice training facility which added magnegas to its training program for new iron workers additionally in january of this year magnegas was selected as a metal cutting fuel for the long island railroad brooklyn accident repairs in new york at the same time we’re accelerating our organic and acquisition expansion plans in the state of florida with the reasonable goal of expanding to a majority of metropolitan markets in the state of florida by the end of  we believe adding new locations will enable us to drive high margin revenue growth in the key market in the coming months we also expanded our product offering in florida to include the commercial sale of beverage carbon dioxide as a complimentary product to our industrial gas line of products in sarasota and fort myers and are now planning to roll this out into other retail locations in the state of florida in the coming months we believe the sale of co will lead to organic revenue growth opportunities in florida and sales to new customers we plan to initially sell co in a large restaurants travel and leisure markets where there is expansive use of co in carbonated beverages in florida we are gaining a foothold in the us automotive market as well earlier this year we announced that we expanded into the indiana market with direct sales of industrial gases welding supplies and magnegas to a fortune  us automaker this follows on an earlier announcement in july of  with the us automaker base in the midwestern united states that also adopted magnegas for its initial manufacturing facility that relationship has since expanded to include a second facility in october  facilities we are currently servicing produce light trucks and automobiles and are using magnegas as the exclusive fuel for metal cutting due to its faster cut time and hotter flame temperature compared to existing fuels given our recent success in the midwest and automotive markets we hired an experienced industrial gas sales executive to support this key client while further expanding our market presence in these markets as more factories are running at higher production rates we expect magnegas to accelerate penetration as a cost reduction enabler we are confident that magnegas would become the metal cutting standard rapidly earlier this month we announced that we successfully installed a  kilowatt plasmaarc gasification unit at green arc supply in louisiana green arc supply of louisiana purchased a gasifier to manufacture and distribute magnegas exclusively in certain regions of louisiana and texas magnegas received a total of  for the purchase of this system in addition to recurring royalty payments we are excited to have our first operating system at a customer location and plan to replicate this model with other distributors in other geographic markets which include upfront payments plus longterm high margin royalties we continue to look for opportunities to increase equipment sales in january  we signed a definitive agreement for  million of equipment of our proprietary gasification and sterilization system for a company based in germany this transaction represents the largest sale in our history and our first sale of gasification systems in europe moreover the german company has indicated their interest to purchase additional systems for multiple markets these two systems are expected to be used for demonstration and service contracts with the goal of entering the agricultural municipal wastewater treatment and industrial gas markets in germany we believe that this transaction finally sets the stage for our expansion across europe and globally regarding cocombustion the company completed its move from michigan to florida to reduce cost and to increase testing turnaround time while testing has recommenced and is ongoing as we speak the company now believes the certification of this product is more complex and involved than previously anticipated in  we conducted a series of tests of our developmental wastewater sterilization systems which were encouraging in florida alone one third of all residents use septic systems for disposal of their wastewater there are significant challenges faced by companies retained to treat this waste and we believe magnegas has a better alternative we will continue to pursue this through additional testing collaboration and marketing we also continue to work closely with representatives from usda to explore potential opportunities in the agricultural industry and for sterilization systems magnegas has also recently implemented comprehensive cost reduction and realignment program in  the company completed a production cost reduction program of magnegas following an engineering program to identify a much more cost effective feedstock the company has also initiated a comprehensive reduction of nonessential operating overheads this program includes vendor consolidation headcount reductions and redeployment of personnel from support staff to sales staff this reduction in feedstock cost and our expense reductions should enhance profitability going forward this month we presented at the cleanequity monaco conference on march th and th to senior financial and strategic cleantech investors policy makers legislatures end users and media one of the sponsors of the event was prince albert ii and the event was hosted by innovator capital we are also happy to announce we held our very first annual magnegas distributor development program meeting in clearwater florida the meeting went very well and we discussed a number of important initiatives on how to grow our sales further with distributors in conclusion we have spent the last two years proving our model that by using magnegas is a door opener in a perfectly commoditized industry we’re able to achieve growth rate with faster path our competition as a result we are currently growing our sales at an estimated rate of  times the industry average while we’re accelerating commercialization of magnegas future investments would be increasingly focused towards revenue generating activities at this point i’d like to turn the call over to our cfo scott mahoney who will review our financial performance in detail scott mahoney thank you ermanno revenues for the year ended december   were  million as compared to  million for the same period last year revenues for the year ended december   from our industrial gas segment were  million versus  million in the same period of the prior year magnegas has also experienced close to  revenue growth for magnegas fuel sales versus the same period last year the increase was primarily due to additional customers and distributors acquired through essi and the results of our marketing programs gross margins increased  from  for the full year ending december   versus december   this improvement was in part due to increased sales of our highermargin offerings particularly magengas and our proprietary equipment sales as well as controlling and improving the cost of materials in addition the gross profit from the green arc sales was higher than anticipated due to lower component costs and installation expenses incurred operating expenses increased approximately  million for the full year ending december   to  million from  million for the same period the prior year the increase in our operating expense in  was primarily attributable to the completion of our new headquarters and increased consulting expenses related to research and development investor relations public relations and new business development as of december   we had a cash balance of  million versus  million as of december   from a financially perspective we see meaningful growth opportunities for the business as a whole we now have two years of solid data that clearly demonstrates the commercialization potential of the magnegas two products as a key competitive advantage for continued accelerated growth in the industrial gas and welding supply industry we will look to capitalize in this track record through accelerated organic growth and targeted select acquisitions as this business model matures and scales we will increasingly rely on this business to self fund more focused rd around sterilization filtration and cocombustion verticals we are also very encouraged by the accelerating interest with respect to customers seeking to purchase our equipment both in the united states and in europe at this point we would like to open the call up to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of sameer joshi of rodman  renshaw please proceed with your question sameer joshi so the question relates to the  million order as i understand there was a  million upfront payment that was expected  days after signing is that right ermanno santilli yes and we are actually expecting that at some point soon scott mahoney yes the indication is that that will be paid sameer joshi and so just to follow up on that what is the timeline for deploying all these  the two systems and then the delivery of cylinders and regulators ermanno santilli this is the germany sameer joshi the german yes the german ermanno santilli production will take between six to nine months possibly longer possibly shorter depending on component supply but the filled up bottles and the regulators that they are also purchasing can be sent over quite quickly we have also discussed with them possibilities of leasing one of our small  kilowatt demonstration units which we are discussing right now as well just to get a head start on some of the testing sameer joshi okay the six to nine months is  had that period begun or is that going to begin once you get the first payment scott mahoney it will begin when we get the first payment we would expect the revenue to be recognized in the current year sameer joshi so the next question relates to opex and i think you spoke to it during your prepared remarks but when i look at the sga expense i see around  million for the fourth quarter which was higher than the  million to  million that we had seen in the previous three quarters going forward should we expect that  million level or how should we look at it sga scott mahoney we haven’t provided specific guidance but our goal is to aggressively contain and eliminate any sort of redundant or unnecessary nonrevenue generating sga we’ve initiated and completed a very extensive realignment of resources internally so whereas in the past we had a more balanced investment on a quarterly basis between sales business development and research we shifted heavily towards immediate nearterm commercialization sales opportunities so there has been a procurement ph in unnecessary noncore expenses elimination of lot of expenses that which the vendors that may provide a consultant service for other things that at this point are not necessary to growing the topline and we’re optimistic that will have a significant impact on the bottom line sameer joshi understood just to get a little bit nuance there is there  do these numbers have  the sga in particular have any of the moving expenses or closing of the facilities expenses scott mahoney yes that’s a fair component of the overall annual expense there is also some expense incurred in the fourth quarter that may be will be a little bit higher than normal for things that you would not expect to incur on an ongoing basis and we did have an executive change that would come with some fictional cost recognized in the quarter we brought on and made some changes to some of our vendors and used stockbased compensation to preserve and extend cash so there is a number of factors sort of fourth quarter being a little higher but i suspect it will be meaningfully lower going forward sameer joshi understood that’s helpful the next couple of questions relate to the cocombustion the coal cocombustion technology development in particular i understand the australian program is sort of on a pause right now is that correct ermanno santilli no we’re actually  we’re testing as we speak it’s just that we just struggled to as easily or as readily replicate some of the results that we’ve seen up in michigan moving the unit down you do change your setup we have some limitation in the space that we’re in regarding safety which places more bends and the piping and everything else of course our partner passed away so we lost some of that knowledge he kept cards very close to his chest so it’s not pausing actually i was texting the project manager on that today and we’re burning as we speak sameer joshi okay so it will be on track soon also in october last year there was a talk about acquisition of a coal combustion technology company can you give us an update on that ermanno santilli yes that is ongoing we’re actually actively in discussions to continue to advance the opportunity obviously it’s something that we’ve not probably provided an update on so we want to be careful of exactly what we discuss but the transaction is still making meaningful progress and we think it is a very strong fit with our business model if we were to complete the transaction sameer joshi okay one last one from me and thanks for taking all these questions will you help us understand the  million item on the income statement which is related to sale of property and equipment scott mahoney i’m sorry could you ask the question one more time sameer joshi there is  million cost and it is related to sale of property in the fourth quarter scott mahoney we had some disposition of some old equipment carried as inventory but we haven’t  we didn’t dispose of any other hard assets so with the new auditors they took a close look at some of our carried values for some of the legacy machines that we used and we will use some of the assets installed in those machines to switch out replacement parts and maintenance for our ongoing production and some of the expenses incurred were to write down some of the carried values to be as conservative as possible so multiple speakers sameer joshi got it no it is part of the  million total operating expenses so i’ll hand… scott mahoney that’s right it’s really just an impairment  the noncash impairment operator our next question comes from the line of jim miller of southwest ph capital please proceed with your question unidentified analyst scott maybe that you can shed a little bit more light on the cost reduction program that you’ve going on and not too much detail but just a little bit more light as far as how much more we can expect and what the picture would look like for  scott mahoney well obviously it’s a small company  that’s a great question by the way jim thank you for taking the time to listen and ask something like this it gives us chance to really talk what we’re trying to do this year as someone who as you’ll know i am new to the company and one of the things that the board really wanted to see and as i mentioned try to do to focus on is try to accelerate sales of what we now commercially is viable and works and gives us the ability to grow our business as rapidly and as profitably as possible but at the same time they want us to be very careful to minimize any potential frictional costs that were not core as central to getting the company to profitability as quickly as possible so as someone who came in in the fourth quarter of last year the first thing that i looked at was forced ranking the three verticals that we have opportunity sets in today industrial gas we have the cocombustion utility service space and then we have the wastewater sterilization and filtration space and just as someone sort of handicapping risks probabilities and timelines to me it looks very clear that gas was really that could make money in the nearterm sterilization the technology is proven we just need to develop the right revenue generating model to be able to take the service to market and cocombustion is a big opportunity set but it’s also a project that could take several to many years to fully commercialize so really where we shifted our cost control immediately was to try to minimize any third parties involved in things like writing the grant ph for helping us to conduct independent studies on things that weren’t immediately central to generating revenue and we shifted more of the discretionary spending into the sales force you’ve seen some announcements about expanding into co expanding into the tampa market wanting to really have a game plan to grow our existing organic sales force in florida we expanded into fort wayne indiana so a lot of our expenses have basically been eliminated if there wasn’t clear path to that investment having a short period ph of that period but the highest possible irr hopefully that makes sense but as you see in the next couple of qs i think a lot more detail and clarity will be available so that we can have more meaningful followup calls like this in the next couple of quarters ermanno santilli and to follow on to that scott and i and the whole management team we’ve been working really hard on this pivot and it really has been cascaded throughout the entire company we’re focused moreandmore on what’s going to generate revenue and that really is now the objective of the entire company unidentified analyst now along the lines of generating revenue from reading the press release and kind of listening to your comments earlier i get the sense that germany should be significant at some point again it’s early in the process what  as far as big picture how does that change your mindset or how does that play into your pivot as far as revenue growth going forward ermanno santilli well you’ve probably heard me on these conference calls in the past and i’ve certainly shared this internally at magnegas corporation that i’m very confident that magnegas will one day be larger in europe than we are in united states and that’s simply because the costly environment in europe has been better monetized than here in united states i think this starts with germany is very strong it’s a solid partner their job is to bring new technologies new green technologies to europe and into germany and they found us we’ve  i’ve known one of their partners for years now and i met them when i was over in europe so they’re fully qualified very well funded and this is what they do our vision is that this is the start of industrial gas business in germany so we are taking our prudent products in united states and taking it over to europe and then italy is continuing to make progress on the agricultural sterilization side and we are pretty confident that that is going to continue and that could take up the sterilization product so this time next year we could have a very healthy gasification and sterilization business in europe unidentified analyst okay and scaling up in europe kind of looking forward any issues there ermanno santilli no the model that we’ve taken  i’m sorry go ahead unidentified analyst no when that time comes will there  how does that play into the model that you work with ermanno santilli currently we have no intention of having a physical presence in europe apart from distributors distributors are fantastic because they bring local talent expertise and as you know every market in europe is different with different  somewhat different laws at different regulations so for our industries we will need local talent and instead of investing it with bricks and mortar we look for distributors so really from that perspective i think we’ll find i think from the production perspective we have already discussed with the german partners that in the future if there is a need to produce in germany in order to speed delivery that we would produce  they would produce nonproprietary pieces of the unit and we will provide the proprietary pieces and they would be assembled in germany with our specs of course we would be on hand to assist with the first few units but then after that it would relatively easy to reduce cost of shipment and production and produce these units in europe operator our next question comes from the line of jim mcilree of chardan capital please proceed with your question jimmcilree i think in the script you talked about purchasing  more cylinders what’s the capital requirement for that and how does that pace out over the course of the year scott mahoney typically speaking the cylinders cost  and  depending upon the type and configuration so the  is i would take an average of the  a unit and at this point we will probably fund that over the next days or less right now if there is a lot of pentup demand both with their own customers the customers that are serviced through our distributor relationships and our new business development efforts so that’s a very high quest problem for us to have it at this point we are very fortunate to be there and it’s just a matter of pace and as we source capital may grow operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brian rockowitz of aegis capital please proceed with your question brian rockowitz my question  i got a couple first is about the royalty agreements that you have with green arc supply can you elaborate a little bit on what those may look like going forward and then the same question do you have royalty agreement in place with the german company scott mahoney yes so essentially that question can be answered the same way for both transactions and i would probably suggest that the model we are trying to build is as these prospective equipment buyers come in yes we are looking to monetize the sale with the highest possible margins but we’re also trying to maximize the net present value of both the sale of the unit and that discounted present value of the royalty stream the way i would think about it is the royalty stream is actually a component of a couple of different things when we sell the units there are some ongoing service and maintenance and training obligations that the customer will pay for there is the royalty on the actual production of the gas and then typically speaking depending upon where the machine is going to be located the customer may also be buying some of their consumables through us to try to benefit from economies of scale from joint purchasing so the way i would typically model to the people as i said take whatever an upfront purchase price of the unit is and you’re probably going to see roughly a  recurring revenue trail thereafter i don’t want to say in perpetuity but as long as the machine’s in place you’re going to see that kind of a trail and generally speaking your royalties are going to be at a  margins everything else is going to be probably not much better than  margins i think if we just keep it very simple and think about a  revenue trail at about a  gross margin there’s almost no operating expense incrementally because essentially they’re going to be paying for our people’s time who are already on our books and being incurred within our sga so you’re going to basically a gross income from that revenue trail theoretically drops straight through to ebitda brian rockowitz and would you mind providing a little bit of an update on the holston gases of tennessee distributor agreement you haven’t mentioned anything about that in this call ermanno santilli yes well the holston gases they’re a fantastic distributor in multiple states they have really turned on to magnegas and the entire sales team has been visiting there has really done a great effort to sell through all the branches i think we’re probably touching a fraction of the branches that we could ultimately touch and we believe that one day they will be a customer to purchase units just on green arc so they can control their own destiny with the cutting fuel and produce magnegas on their facilities brian rockowitz and my last question and it’s a little bit of tough one to ask but the stock’s been trading under  now for some time have you guys been notified or is there any concern about being delisted off of the nasdaq scott mahoney we are not concerned about being delisted we are proactively addressing the situation i think we have made it publicly known in the past we’re required to notice whenever we get a notice like that from nasdaq and the company has received that notice in the past so we are in the process of addressing that with nasdaq as we speak brian rockowitz are you guys considering some sort of a reverse split or anything of that nature scott mahoney i can’t really comment on anything specifically other than we are proactively working with nasdaq and if there were anything like that should be forthcoming you have to see it in filings to know that operator there are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference i would now like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remarks ermanno santilli thanks very much for joining this call i think over the past few quarters those of you who attended and listened can see that we have grown much more confident with magnegas we have been consistently proving our business model we are consistently outselling the industry we are taking customers away from competition six months ago we were deeply focused on cocombustion and sterilization i think that we continue to be focused on those markets but we are pivoting our investments to what we know is going to raise our revenue gross profit and ultimately bring the company to profitability since the end of  we have spent a lot of time as a management team to reduce costs both on sga and on production cost of magnegas and those have really given great results we are looking forward to the next quarterly conference call to be able to see them and that’s going to make us  reduce our cost on sga and ultimately reduce our  improve our margins on magnegas so that we can grow the business even more aggressively thank you very much operator this concludes today’s conference thank you for your participation you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day copyright policy all transcripts on

to turn his father’s ideas into a worldchanging technology through an ultrahot cleanburning fuel produced by magnegas corp photo by mark wemple executive summary company magnegas corp  industry technology   key firm seeks to make good on its promising technology technology that will change the world it’s hard to find an upandcoming company that doesn’t make the claim and ermanno santilli is no different santilli’s father an italianborn mathematician and physicist named ruggero santilli founded magnegas corp in  his hope replace propane and acetylene with what he described as a more efficient cleanerburning metalcutting gas in the years since the younger santilli and his team have found other uses for the firm’s magnegasfueled plasma arc flow technology the list runs a wide gamut from sewage and sludge treatment to even creating energy from the dirty emissions of a coal plant products using magnegas became available in january but a widespread rollout of products using all of magnegas’ full potential remains months if not years away new ideas acetylene has been the fuel of choice for metalcutting torches for more than a century in the same way car owners are taking baby steps toward alternative fuel sources like electricity metalcutters are doing the same when it comes to parting ways with their tried and true santilli says but it’s a slow pace “we have a resistance to change” says santilli who succeeded his father as ceo of magnegas in  “it’s a slow growth these companies we want as customers are not on the internet they are not on amazon for us it’s about wordofmouth it’s about relationships” magnegas isn’t waiting however the company already has expanded applications for the gas including a trial project in indiana designed to cut the sterilization time of pig manure from months to almost instantly santilli is most excited about is a new project where magnegas could almost double the energy yield from coal burning “the gas we get is superpowerful” santilli says “when it’s oxidized we’re talking about reaching temperatures up to  degrees comparable to  degrees in acetylene the higher the flame temperature the better the combustion” at twice the temperature of the sun’s surface magnegas practically rips apart carbon dioxide the primary pollutant known to affect climate change that creates an emission the company says is cleaner than burning natural gas the ignited gas can then be injected into the smoke emission from a coalburning power plant creating a second combustion which could produce even more energy “power plants like the one duke energy operates in crystal river have to spend more than a billion dollars on scrubbers to keep a lot of that coal smoke out of the atmosphere” santilli says “we could replace those scrubbers with our gas and increase the energy efficiency of that coal from  to  or even ” rough patches with opportunities like that santilli’s confidence is understandable “this is going to be one of the biggest shakeups to the power industry since nuclear power” santilli says “if you can take coal from  to  efficiency it’s a trilliondollar business in america alone” however magnegas is far from a trilliondollar corporation eight years after it was founded it’s not even a profitable one the firm has generated revenue of more than  million since  but has posted a net loss totaling  million during that same period nasdaq has twice threatened to delist magnegas stocks after prices dropped below  in fact the company has until june to turn around its share price which closed last week at  cents finding ways to effectively commercialize new technology can be a long process says daniel james scott a longtime local leader in technology startups who was named executive director of the tampa bay technology forum in january “being an innovator is tough” he says “the folks at universities are really smart inventing these cures and potions and lotions but they just don’t have the industry to fall back on there is no executive picking up the mantle on their behalf helping them gain access to new and fresh markets” that also can happen at the corporate level especially with a newer company that hasn’t fully realized the potential of the technology it possesses scott says many startups stay largely unknown depending on angel investors and other venture capital to keep research and development funded yet firms that choose the route of public money like magnegas are constantly exposed during that critical time warts and all “i tell startups all the time that even with all the fancy metrics analytics and frameworks that we have today they are still no less risky than they were  years ago” scott says “it’s still a leap of faith” don’t miss out patient money remains the best money scott says jabil circuit inc in st petersburg is a perfect example throughout the early s just as the electronic products services company was starting out shares hovered around  the dotcom bubble in  shot share prices well above the  mark for a short time but jabil has since lived around the  mark for the past four years it’s one of the region’s top five largest public companies with a market cap of more than  billion magnegas which trades on the nasdaq using the symbol mnga is nowhere near that level with a market cap a little more than  million staying patient and keeping an open mind however could help turn magnegas into the next jabil one startup entrepreneur says “most companies come in with a focus on a technology and a problem but they don’t know where the market is going” says taylor wallace cofounder and ceo of wevue in tampa “it’s often a hard sell for young entrepreneurs because they get so fixated on the idea they started with they miss out on new opportunities” wevue faced a situation just like that wallace and partner saxon baum developed a smartphone app to aggregate pictures and videos from concerts or sporting events the app would then create single places through this new social media platform to see and hear everything from an event the problem however was having enough users at specific events to make the product worthwhile it was a problem wallace and baum quickly realized they would not be able to solve “we instead found that partnering with a lot of business events like holiday parties or conferences created a lot of success for us” wallace says “it became a way to focus on company culture through crowd sourcing sharing content in a way that would’ve been costprohibitive before” partnering for profits in that regard diversification remains a key component of santilli’s approach at magnegas he’s not willing to just sit and wait for markets like acetylene usage to shift instead santilli says it’s worth the risk to throw possible applications out and see which ones stick “just like any business we’re going to have  ideas and maybe just three of them will work” santilli says “and that is great we have so many applications that we’re thinking about and patents that we’re working on that we’re really not worried” with annual losses well into seven digits the current focus at magnegas is to reduce costs by bringing in partners magnegas recently announced a partnership with two companies it didn’t name a deal that will help fund research and testing of its coal energy production project the company has already spent more than  on that project magnegas also is working on plans to better distribute its gas to more customers that’s why it acquired equipment sales  service inc of pinellas park in october for  million “there are a lot of companies out there who are onehit wonders or even hail marys where all their chips are in one place” santilli says “we already have three different business lines and even if we find success with just one of them we know we can change the world”     what is magnegas magnegas is a hydrogenbased fuel created through the company’s plasma arc flow technology liquid waste such as sewage animal manure or even used antifreeze flows through a submerged electric arc between two electrodes as the arc decomposes the liquid molecules into atoms it forms a plasma around the electrodes that reach temperatures above  degrees fahrenheit when the plasma is moved away from the electrodes magnegas rises to the surface which can then be collected and used magnegas can be used for everything from transportation fuel to metal cutting to even cooking and heating this story was updated to reflect new information about the timing of magnegas products related headlines new in town wired in train rolling play it cool comments this company and their technology for cocombustion will bring coal power back into play and if you get in now and hold for a while you can profit enormously  significant announcements regarding cocombustion likely are coming soon with positive test results  stock is now trading in the  range with a huge upside once this news hits added by javascript must be enabled to view this email address on sunday apr  michael do you believe mnga’s ceo is alone in thinking the technology to produce an entirely new species of fuel from waste which burns  degree f hotter than thought physically possible by the “really smart folks” at universities and is able to reduce c and toxic pollutants from coal power plants by  at an actual cost savings should be classified as “world changing” technology magnegas burns cleaner less c  per the edison welding report than natural gas yet outperforms the nastiest hydrocarbon based fuel on the market acetylene  i really don’t think it is fair to compare the prospects of something like magnegas which can physically literally when adopted alter the chemical composition of earth’s atmosphere in a good way to some guy who thinks his new iphone app is going to “change the world” yes progress has been “slow” for mnga but for obvious reasons – just google “magnegas” as i am sure you did prior to writing this article for the last  years nobody including wikipedia editors metal cutters or university professors thought for one single second that any fuel could release a  surplus of oxygen when it burned – let alone cut metal  faster than acetylene which is why they flat out ignored magnegas by dismissing it as nothing but “pseudoscience”  which they were clearly now all wrong about  unless you think gm fdny ewi and us navy are all just on mnga’s ‘pay roll’ to put things in perspective – since the company’s tech advanced a year ago to be able to process used cooking oils resulting in the less expensive to produce and higher performing mg series of fuel the company has since last  months converted the new york city fire department and a major utility company duke energy  allegedly to switch to magnegas the previous “slow” pace certainly appears to now be accelerating with the fuel now vetted by big name clients as actually being real doesn’t it mnga is the only company in last  years which has developed a fuel which can outperform acetylene  if you think i am might be exaggerating here then take  minutes of your time and call those “smart folks” at the university and ask them to provide you with the chemical equation of the alleged ‘generic’ mixture of “conventional gases” which is also expected to cut  inch plates as fast as mg does they will not be able to answer you as magnegas is literally a new species of fuel based on different type of bonding mechanism available in nature but one that has eluded scientists since o ozone – which is technically a magnecule was first discovered in  science can literally “save the world” – provided technology  like mnga’s is developed to harness this knowledge into much needed new industrial applications finally to clarify – dr santilli’s goal for the last  years was to create a nonunitary covering of quantum mechanics to provide the framework to develop fundamentally new types of energy and clean burning fuels  which he has done  the whole ‘acetylene replacement’ things was just the easiest market niche lowest barriers for entry to enter and monetize the invention while in the process demonstrating to the world that magnegas is unlike any other fuel on the market and really should be used in cars and fossil fuel plants – as originally intended by dr santilli it’s nice to see more people writing about mnga but i just wish people had a better understanding of basic science so they could recognize the significance of totally new chemical species unlike anything anyone has ever seen before  feel free to interview me i don’t work of mnga or ask me any questions about the technology and science if you ever decide to do a follow up article on magnegas thanks don borghi

ermanno santillishare this page ceo of the month ermanno santilli magnegas corporation is a highly innovative technology company that counts among its inventions a patented process that converts liquid waste into hydrogen based fuels we spoke to ermannosantilli ceo of magnegas to find out more about his company and learn more about the truly gamechanging technology they have created first of all could you give us an overview of your companythe technology behind our company and the product magnegas® was actually founded by my father dr santilli and throughout the years we have evolved into a fully independent publicly traded company with over  shareholders last year the increase in our stock performance was close to  and our shareholder base and institutional shareholder base grew by approximately  we are unique in the fact that we are the only green technology or greentech company that is based on a process called submerged plasma arc flow technologyplease tell us more about this technology how would you describe it to someone outside of your industrythis submerged plasma arc flow technology is just a fancy way of saying that we take a liquid and we shoot an electric arc through it basically we zap it with electricity and when you do that a gas is created that bubbles to the surface once this is done we filter it compress it and then fill our cylinders with it we have independently verified our gases and have found that our gases are hotter safer and cut much faster than any other cutting fuel product out there because of this our gas is currently being used by nasa subcontractors on the space center project the fire department of new york city both the us army and navy and several of the top utilities in the us as well as thousands of customers throughout florida and the rest of the country across our company we have three lines of business industrial gas agricultural and energy believe it or not for industrial gas we actually use soybean oil with our process the liquid you put in dictates the type of gas that comes out what we found to be the best application for the replacement of acetylene is soybean oil but that may change over time many customers rave about the faster cutting speed of our product magnegas and just about everyone who tries it switches over the customer response is so great that we are ramping up our production to accommodate this everincreasing demandbut that’s just one of our operating modes another involves taking waste manures such as hog manure raw sewage or anything that has biological activity and processing this waste for this process we flow it through instead of zapping it and the heat and the electric arc kills any bacteria this process renders it completely inert yet it is still full of the nutrients that nature puts into manures what this means is that farmers can take what are in essence one of the most abundant wastes in the world and reuse these liquids in the form of sterilized water and soil supplementswe continue to test this sterilization application at several large farms and have many discussions underway with the us department of agriculture and others in terms of collaborations as you can imagine the agricultural business is a very stable business and doesn’t adopt new technologies very quicklyour third opportunity energy uses a very specific type of gas and the reason why our gas is so much more effective is that it has a very high flame temperature the city college of new york in the us tested our gas and found that it has a  degree fahrenheit flame temperature significantly higher than any other industrial gas typically speaking when you burn something the higher the flame temperature the better the efficiency and lower emissions when you burn something using the product magnegas at such a high temperature you get more complete combustion along with our partners in australia we found that if you take certain fuels and mix it with our gas you can burn it in a way that is both cleaner and more efficientthis brings us to another one of our innovations cocombustion which is we believe is a real gamechanger coal fired electric generating plants continue to provide approximately  of the world’s power so it’s not going away anytime soon in certain countries however coal has a bad name and many coal plants are being forced to close due to their polluting emissions andor expensive co taxes when you burn a lump of coal it’s burning at best at a  efficiency which wastes energy and creates a lot of particulate matter in the smoke emitted that smoke contains pollutants that many believe are heavy contributors to climate changeour work has shown that if you inject the product magnegas into a specially designed chamber and have an ignition point you have a secondary combustion event that allows you to burn the smoke again at a much higher efficiency using magnegas in this coalburning process we can add another  efficiency at a minimum while at the same time achieving a substantial reduction in emissions of co and other greenhouse gases we firmly believe that this is going to have a significant impact on the coalburning industry as a whole and on our global environment as wellthe advantages of this technology goes beyond increased energy efficiency “scrubbers” which are the current technology used to reduce coal emissions are highly expensive costing up to  million dollars each the average coalfired power plant needs about four of them so there is certainly a capex and opex opportunity alongside being more efficient in our industry people fight tooth and nail to try and improve the efficiency of coal and spend billions of dollars on being more efficient we can turn the game on its head because we don’t treat the smoke as a waste stream but as a new energy source as a result of using our fuelwe’ve been working on this project for about two years with one of the largest power companies in the united states who has apready spent over  billion on carbon capture depending on the setup and configuration we’re getting up to a  to  reduction in the level of co emissions there is no other technology that reduces co and saves money most companies tend to put it underground or convert it into something what this company has said to us is that we are the only company they’ve come across that potentially reduces co and saves moneycould you give us an insight into what it’s like to work in your industry what are the major challenges facing your company at presentgenerally speaking launching any new technology can be difficult especially in our target industries if you took your mobile phone out of your pocket chances are that it’s no more than two or three years old that’s because the mobile phone industry moves to adopt new technologies and ideas very quickly by contrast the industrial gas business has far less innovation and the people in that market are just not as used to changes like you and i are about our phones there’s a tendency to stick to what we’re doing and less willingness to adopt to new innovationsin terms of challenges when you experience the type of rise our company has experienced in just one year you attract a lot of attention and some of this can be quite negative this negative attention typically comes from people who are speculators and manipulators shorting your stock and writing wild and speculative things which has led to a lot of potential distractions we’ve worked hard to keep our eye on the prizeas a growing company it’s inevitable that you’ll continue to build your team what are some of the qualities you look for when hiring staffwe find that because our industry is not as dynamic as others instead we look for parallel or related industries and try and use the experience garnered there to add value to our company we look for innovators and early adopters those with an open mind as well as classical experience in the world of engineeringin fact we’ve actually had luck recruiting exmilitary members who now make up  of our staff and it is very humbling to have them work for our company some of them have been incredibly decorated for their service and we find that that level of structure and experience and their ability to adapt has been very important to usas for the award how does it feel to have been selected as ceo of the monthit feels great to be selected as ceo of the month and it is certainly an honor i would like to thank wealth  finance very much last year’s stock performance is something we’re obviously proud of but what really drives us is that we are taking this fantastic technology and using it to try and create a strategic shift in the energy markets i have often said that our work in the cocombustion of coal will be the biggest news in the energy sector since the advent of nuclear power our social media following has also demonstrated that a lot of people love what we do and this is what motivates me to press forwardduring my time as ceo we have had a lot of success in terms of product development and market penetration i am an open integrator and one of the first things i did was to have a worldwide meeting with all of our various partners and collaborators actually this was where the cocombustion model was born we have brought in many fresh new faces from four years ago and are now moving into a new and bigger facility and during this time we went from an over the counter company to being listed on nasdaqlastly what would be your major plans for  and beyond do you have any interesting opportunities on the horizonour objectives are quite simple and straightforward first we’re going to continue to penetrate the  billion industrial gas market later this year we are going to place our first unit in the us to produce gas in addition to this we have several other customers waiting in the wings for the placement of a unit we’re going to grow at the right speed for our size and resources second in the agricultural sector we’re going to continue to partner with the usda we also have some very interesting testing going on both in europe and the us third on the cocombustion side we expect to complete our testing in q and we anticipate several significant opportunities to come out of it we will continue to do more and grow develop and transform while keeping our operating costs under control magnegas corporation has never been in such a fantastic position to grow and prosper share this page next → ← previous finance
