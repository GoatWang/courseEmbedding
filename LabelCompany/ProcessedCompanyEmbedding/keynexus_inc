xero and xerox parc the event sponsors had tabletop displays outside the main room i’m not sure the cloudrelated vendors expected to generate many sales leads from this event in at least one case the vendor was there because it was a local event and one of their marquee customers was a speaker having a namebrand customer talk about how they use your cloud product is a good enough reason for a local upstartup to sign up especially when the interviews are recorded cloudbeat  sponsors interesting storage and security vendors included keynexus scality and swiftstack scality and swiftstack provide highlyscalable software defined storage solutions to larger organizations these are object storage systems based on the openstack framework the software takes advantage of commodity servers and hard drives rather than use a san or nas for storage these systems pool the storage in each server and make it available in the cloud unlike nas and san the number of processors and network controllers scales alongside the storage allowing the system to support a very high volume of concurrent users the software then centrally manages data protection replication and performance caching using serverbased ram or flash cool stuff keynexus launched their cloudbased encryptionkey storage and management solution for amazon web services aws ec at cloudbeat keynexus enables organizations to store manage and audit their encryption keys separately from the cloud addressing the principal inhibitor to broader faster adoption of the cloud by enterprises — security  here’s how they describe it there are three typical cloud security scenarios first the key to unlock encrypted data is stored in the same cloud as the data that’s like locking your house but leaving the key in the lock in the second scenario companies employ vendor solutions that host the key in an undisclosed location that’s like having to call a security guard to access your home and unlock the door and trusting the security guard never goes in when you are away option three involves securing the key onsite within the enterprise which can be costly the keynexus approach separates the “lock” from the “key” in the cloud while also promoting encryption interoperability across the public cloud using a hardware appliance to create the keys keynexus simplifies the management of remote key rotation as well as the migration of encrypted data between various cloud saas and mobile platforms about the author david x lamont is an accomplished marketer of it products and a partner at marketingsage a pr and lead
