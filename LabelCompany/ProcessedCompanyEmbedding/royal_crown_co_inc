business company history index beverages royal crown company inc  company profile information business description history background information on royal crown company inc  corporate drivefort lauderdale florida usa history of royal crown company inc a distant third in the billion soft drink industry royal crown company inc produces and sells concentrates used in the production of soft drinks that are sold domestically and internationally to independent licensed bottlers royal crowns leading brand rc cola ranked as the thirdlargest national brand of cola behind pepsi and cocacola and stood as the only national brand cola alternative available to noncocacola and nonpepsicola bottlers the companys other brands included diet rc cola diet rite cola nehi nehi lockjaw upper  and kick royal crown was a wholly owned subsidiary of rcarbys corporation which in turn was owned by triarc companies inc origins royal crown was born from the efforts of claud adkin hatcher a turnofthecentury pharmacist residing in columbus ohio who coowned a grocery wholesale business established in  the colehatcherhampton grocery company was started by hatcher his father and two other partners but by  the hatchers had bought out their partners and abbreviated the name of their business to hatcher grocery company by the time of the name change claud hatcher was spending more and more of his time in the basement of the family business driven downstairs by a combination of anger and a need for selfsufficiency for the first timeand not the last timehatchers way of doing business collided headlong with the business philosophy of a georgiabased company named cocacola the friction between hatcher and a cocacola representative sparked the creation of royal crown and marked the beginning of royal crowns centurylong struggle to capture market share from cocacola the reigning leader of the soft drink industry the sparks began to fly when a cocacola bottler named columbus roberts refused to yield to hatchers demands as a grocery wholesaler hatcher purchased a large volume of cocacola from roberts and because of this hatcher believed hatcher grocery co should receive a discount or a commission or in some way should be compensated for the amount of cocacola it purchased roberts disagreed and a heated dispute erupted hatcher declared he had purchased his last case of soft drinks from roberts and vowed to produce and bottle his own beverages under his own labels following through on his promise hatcher retreated to hatcher grocery cos basement and began experimenting with different formulas while his father remained upstairs hatcher the yearold graduate pharmacist worked downstairs creating the foundation of the new family business the first soft drink hatcher created was named royal crown ginger ale and its success opened the hatchers eyes to the opportunities available in the soft drink market in  father and son made their commitment to the soft drink market official by reorganizing hatcher grocery co as union bottling works and concentrating wholly on producing royal crown ginger ale in the months to follow business was brisk the hatchers enjoyed enough success to move to larger production facilities in  but as they quickly realized the greatest profits to be made were in the cola market led by the burgeoning giant cocacola hatcher wanted a share of the lucrative cola market and shortly after union bottling works relocated to its grander facility he introduced his own cherryflavored cola creation dubbed cherocola by  cherocola ranked as the companys greatestselling product the first in a long line of product introductions that would eclipse the popularity of its predecessor the popularity of cherocola led to another event in royal crowns historya name change to reflect the success of its greatest selling product in  union bottling works changed its name to cherocola company an enterprise reorganized to manufacture a line of syrups to be sold to franchised bottlers hatchers first clash with cocacola pitted him against an emissary of the fastgrowing atlantabased soft drink producer hatchers introduction of cherocola and its flowering success swept away all subsidiary layers shielding direct confrontation with cocacola and pitted hatcher against cocacolas senior executives the ensuing struggle was a battle cocacola was intent on winning when hatcher filed to register cherocola as a trademark in  cocacola quickly responded demanding that the word cola be removed from all advertising this first clash touched off a year legal dispute between hatchers business and cocacola a feud over the rights to the word cola that would not be concluded until world war ii was near its end as this exhaustive debate was being argued in the courts hatcher had to contend with more pressing problems his companys first major crisis as one of the first cola wars raged on hostilities in europe gave way to the united states entry into world war i the prosecution of which portended the collapse of the entire soft drink industry in america world war i and legal troubles in  the us government imposed severe restrictions on the use of sugar in products deemed nonessential to the war effort soft drinks of course added little to the countrys fighting might and fell under the wartime restrictions for a brief time the federal government threatened to take its restrictive measures a step further and considered whether or not to ban soft drink production altogether during the course of the war but government officials stopped short of sounding the industrys death knell staving off the termination of their business however did not put soft drink producers in a much better position and each had to make do with sugar supplies reduced to a trickle cherocola responded by establishing and operating its own sugar refinery using raw sugar imported from cuba to keep its operations alive for roughly three years the company relied on its sugar refinery for the essential supply of sugar and managed to persevere through the war years but as cherocola entered the s a host of challenges loomed ahead by  cherocola stood as a thriving business with  franchise bottling plants scattered throughout the south and midwest but when sugar prices collapsed during the early years of the decade the companys considerable cache of sugar became a liability cherocolas problems were amplified in  when its legal battle with cocacola reached a decisive juncture after nine years of contentious debate cocacola prevailed and cherocola was ordered to remove the word cola from all advertisements in the wake of the courts ruling the abbreviated chero beverage fared far worse than cherocola and lost much of its market eventually the production of chero which represented cherocolas chief source of revenue was discontinued entirely the quick death of chero could have had disastrous repercussions for the company but hatchers timing in introducing a new product provided cherocola with a potent revenuegenerating engine that easily made up for the loss of chero the same year cocacola won its case against cherocola hatcher introduced a new fruitflavored beverage named melo after hatcher overheard a salesman refer to a competitors soft drink bottle as being kneehigh he changed melos name to nehi a brand name that became familiar to generations of consumers after its  introduction by  sales of nehi beverages were driving the companys financial growth to such an extent that hatcher changed the name of his business to nehi inc with the increasing popularity of nehi the company entered the s at full stride but the great depression stood as a formidable obstacle blocking the companys progress bringing to a halt the encouraging growth that characterized the latter half of the s to make the companys position more precarious hatcher died on new years eve in  stripping nehi inc of its influential leader just as it was grappling with the centurys most pernicious economic crisis together the loss of hatcher and an economic depression of unprecedented proportions represented what could have been a crippling blow to nehi inc but the company fared remarkably well recording one of the most successful decades in its history between  and  the companys annual sales increased tenfold the negative affects of the depression were only temporary after hatchers sudden death the companys vicepresident of sales hilary richard mott took command and immediately cut costs discontinued slowselling products and consolidated production activities less than a year after taking charge mott stood over a debtfree enterprise exhibiting a vibrancy that belied the woeful economic times as motts healing measures were being implemented the companys chemist was working on nehi incs next great product its second cola concoction the greatest money to be earned in the soft drink industry was still in the cola market hatchers realization of this fact had prompted the development of cherocola in the first decade of the century and it prompted him to muster another attempt shortly before his death in  he had instructed his chemist to develop a cola beverage and by  when the company stood on solid financial ground the new cola product was ready for distribution named royal crown the new soft drink represented the companys future becoming a favorite of consumers in the decades to follow although the bulk of the companys revenue was derived from the sale of nehi throughout the remainder of the s much of the companys promotional efforts were directed toward building consumer awareness of royal crown or rc as the cola drink became more commonly known in  the company pioneered blind taste tests using the promotional strategy more than three decades before other soft drink manufacturers did so according to the results of the publiclyperformed blind taste tests rc was the winner spawning the best by taste test slogan one year after nehi inc started its blind taste test publicity campaign it hired numerous hollywood celebrities to promote the sale of rc such luminaries as bing crosby joan crawford shirley temple lucille ball and ronald reagan appeared in advertisements alongside rc piquing consumer interest as public demand for rc increased under the barrage of promotional campaigns the company scored an important victory in the courts in  nehi inc ultimately prevailed in its year legal battle with cocacola when the courts ruled that the company could use the word cola in its advertisements postworld war ii innovations rc cola as the product could be called after the  ruling developed into the companys greatestselling product during the postworld war ii period earning its distinction as the companys mainstay product when nehi inc became royal crown cola company in  under its new corporate banner the company followed up on its success with rc cola by developing the soft drink industrys first sugarfree diet beverage a product the los angeles times selected as the leading new product of the s development of the groundbreaking beverage was completed in  and in  diet rite cola hit retail shelves the product proved to be an enormous success and one for which the other major soft drink manufacturers had no marketable answer fueled by the widespread demand for diet rite cola and rc cola the company thrived throughout s gaining considerable ground on its two biggest rivals pepsi and cocacola according to several accounts the s ranked as the most successful decade in royal crown colas history but the enviable success enjoyed by the company did not carry over into the s royal crown colas eyecatching growth came screeching to a halt in october  on october   the federal government banned the use of the artificial sweetener cyclamate the essential ingredient in royal crown colas diet rite cola the losses suffered from the ban were immediate and profound stripping the company of the product it had come to rely on for much of its growth on the heels of the federal edict against cyclamate company directors vowed never again to become reliant on a single product to drive sales their resolution gave rise to a period of diversification that began in the early s with the acquisition of two fruit juice companies adams packing association and texsun company next the company moved into the home decorative accessories field purchasing seven companies involved in floor tile mirrors picture frames and lamps not done there the company moved farther afield acquiring fastfood franchiser arbys in  two years later company directors observed the longheld tradition of changing their companys name to reflect the mainstay business but this time the name change was purposefully less specific in  royal crown cola company became royal crown companies inc under the corporate umbrella of royal crown companies the soft drink operations were organized into a division no longer representing the sole source of revenue for the royal crown enterprise when diet rite cola was reintroduced in  the soft drink division generated  million of the companys  million in sales for the year a significant percentage of the companys total revenue volume to be sure but representative of only half of what the company had developed into in roughly a decade in  the soft drink division and the rest of the businesses that had been acquired were purchased by corporate takeover artist victor posner who moved royal crown companies to miami beach florida and made the company part of dwg corporation one of several holding companies under his control lackluster s and hope for the s posner controlled royal crown for nine years his tenure of ownership was notable for the introduction of cherry rc diet rc cola and an eightflavor line of diet rite and it was infamous for posners costcutting measures that hacked away at royal crowns already limited marketing budget as a result the company lost ground during the late s and early s ceding market share to its two much larger rivals pepsi and cocacola royal crowns tailspin showed no signs of ending until ownership of the company passed to new hands nelson peltz and peter may in  peltz and may acquired royal crown and arbys through their company triarc companies inc eventually organizing royal crown as a subsidiary of rcarbys corporation a holding company that also oversaw the operation of arbys under the ultimate ownership of triarc royal crowns leading brand rc cola received much greater attention than it had during the s triarc added roughly  million a year to royal crowns marketing budget through the mids and into the late s which helped bolster recognition of the rc brand a new brand royal crown draft cola was introduced in  amid great expectations but production of the product was discontinued roughly a year later following this misstep the owners of royal crown were intent on reestablishing rc cola as a brand able to wrest market share away from pepsi and cocacola something the venerable label had not been able to do for years throughout its history royal crown had demonstrated itself to be a creative innovator but had never seriously threatened its two big rivals in many respects the company had served as a research lab for pepsi and cocacola yet had never been able to reap the full rewards that should have been realized from its pioneering role as the company looked toward the st century its was
