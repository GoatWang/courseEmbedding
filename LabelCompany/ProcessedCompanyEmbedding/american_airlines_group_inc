investor relations corporate responsibility facebook twitter share homenewsroom »press releases»press release details american airlines introduces new basic economy fare wednesday january    am download pdf english pdf format opens in new window  pdf  kb american airlines nasdaqaal today announced it will begin selling basic economy fares in addition to the wide range of main cabin fares currently offered these nofrills tickets provide a simple and affordable way to experience american’s network and provide customers the option to pay for the services they want basic economy fares will go on sale in february in  select markets with the first flights occurring shortly thereafter and expansion to additional markets expected later this year not every american airlines flight will offer basic economy fares “american airlines now has something to offer every customer from those who want simple lowprice travel to those who want an ultrapremium experience via first class” said american airlines president robert isom “importantly this new fare product also gives american the ability to compete more effectively with the growing number of ultra lowcost carriers” click to download click to download here’s a look at what basic economy customers can expect inflight experience – the same inflight experience that all main cabin customers receive today including free entertainment options soft drinks and snacks and the same seats seat assignments – made automatically and only when customers check in paid seat assignments can be purchased  hours before the flight upgrades – not permitted regardless of elite status level bags – one personal carryon item that fits under the seat such as a purse or small backpack is allowed no overhead bin luggage may be brought on board larger carryons such as a rollerboard bag must be checked at the ticket counter for the applicable checkedbaggage charge basic economy customers who bring more than an underseat personal item to the gate will incur regular checked baggage charges plus a  gate service charge per bag elite customers and eligible aadvantage® credit cardmembers will be allowed to bring one personal item one rollerboard and they maintain their current free checked bag allowance boarding – basic economy customers will comprise the last boarding group and will be seated in the main cabin elite customers and eligible aadvantage® credit cardmembers will continue to receive priority or preferred boarding even when purchasing this fare tickets – nonrefundable nonchangeable use it or lose it no sameday flight change or sameday standby aadvantage – full aadvantage miles and elite qualifying dollars may be earned when purchasing these fares however only onehalf elite qualifying mile will be earned per mile flown and onehalf elite qualifying segment per segment flown american is committed to helping every customer find the ticket price and service that’s best for his or her travel needs multiple disclosures will spell out the attributes of a basic economy ticket at the time of purchase on aacom and when utilizing the airline’s reservations phone centers or when booking through a travel agent or online travel site in addition to clear disclosures at the time of purchase basic economy customers will also receive reminders as their travel day gets closer including at checkin kiosks at the airport “our goal is to make sure that all customers have the opportunity to purchase a ticket on american that works for their specific needs” continued isom “we will work hard to ensure transparency provide clear explanations of these fares and we look forward to continuing to offer a wide variety of services to our customers” qa is this a new fare discount in general these fares will be lower than regular main cabin fares in the same way that main cabin fares are lower than business class the idea is to give customers a choice in the kind of ticket they want to purchase it’s not a new discount but a new set of attributes for our lowest fares how many basic economy seats will be available on each flight the number will vary depending on the same factors that affect pricing generally how many markets will have basic economy fares available we’ll introduce basic economy in ten markets and expand in line with customer interest just like with other fare decisions we’ll always be evaluating the right mix of products to offer our customers and we may change those offerings depending on customer demand why not charge basic economy customers to bring a large carryon instead of requiring them to check it we hope that limiting carryons to a personal item will result in fewer bags in overhead bins for basic economy customers planning ahead to check a bag at the ticket counter or kiosk ensures a smoother travel experience without worrying about bin space what happens if a basic economy customer brings a bag to the gate that doesn’t fit under the seat they will need to check that bag at the gate and pay the applicable checkedbaggage fee   for a first bag  for a second bag etc including bags checked at the ticket counter they would also owe a  gate service charge per bag for checking a first or second bag at the gate no gate service charge on bags  is the onboard experience in basic economy different once on the plane basic economy customers have the same inflight experience as anyone else in main cabin including complimentary soft drinks and a snack they sit in regular main cabin seats american has no plans to alter its seats or the interior of its aircraft for basic economy will families that include young children be seated together as it does today american’s reservations system will check for families traveling with children  and under a few days before the flight and attempt to seat each child with an adult this is the same process we follow for main cabin customers  about american airlines group american airlines and american eagle offer an

subsequently so thanks again for joining us and at this point well turn the call over to our chairman and ceo doug parker william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks a lot dan thanks everybody for being on the call this morning we reported our pretax earnings excluding special items of  million we are extremely excited about the near and longterm prospects for american airlines and our shareholders we are in the midst of transforming american through investments in our product and our team and it is working our unit revenues are increasing at a faster rate than our competition and the outlook is strong robert will talk more about that in a minute before that i just want to talk a little bit about an initiative we put in place last night many of you have heard us talk about the mission at american which is to validate the trust that is placed in us that is a trust our customers place in us and when they choose american for their travel and its a trust all of you put in us when you select american as an investment choice and at american building trust for us starts first with our own team we announced yesterday something that impacts our expenses but its also a very important step as we rebuild trust at american with our team the announcement yesterday was that we would make midcontract pay increases for our pilot and flight attendant groups its an unprecedented move because those two groups have close to two years left on their existing contracts and to the best of our knowledge something like this has never been done in our industry and so therefore its a move that might surprise or even dismay some of you because it adds costs to the airline we couldnt be more convicted about doing it and heres why when we merged we knew we were creating not only the largest airline in the world but we set out to build the best and thats best defined by a global network a bestinclass product and an engaged and enthusiastic team with our industry profoundly changed we made a commitment when we merged the new american would have pay rates for our team that were at or near the top of our competitors pay rates and im happy to report that weve lived up to that commitment in every joint contract we negotiated thus far also the reason last fall in spite of not having reached an agreement for our mechanics and fleet service workers we moved their pay rates to industry leading rates in an unprecedented move as those contract negotiations have continued but its the right move for the new american so were going to keep leading this way because its the right way to lead any service organization and certainly the right way to lead american airlines theres a history at american thats bred some mistrust and were working hard to change that culture and the team is making great progress in that regard we recognize pay alone wont build trust but we also know its an important step in the right direction as outlined in our k last night the expense add is about  million annually for something less than two years – im sorry less than – a little over two years as our contracts were amendable at the end of  and early  thats certainly a lot of money of our shareholders but in the bigger picture and taking the longer view as a service organization investments in our team are investments in our product and the leverage at american today is in closing our unit revenue gap and we believe this is an investment that will help us do that and therefore help our shareholders we think its precisely this kind of investment in our people is going to make the difference in our service and while this wont happen overnight we also think its the kind of investment that will continue to drive revenue outperformance for american and as that happens all of you will be the beneficiaries of those returns so in closing were tightening the revenue gap quickly and our investments to accomplish this are going to continue because we work for all of you you can be assured were using your money to create an airline for the longterm we couldnt be more excited about our prospects and now ill turn it to derek for the financials and then robert will talk more specifically about how were doing in the operation and in our revenue progress derek derek j kerr  american airlines group inc thanks doug and good morning everyone before i begin id like to thank our  team members who continue to do an exceptional job of taking care of our customers because of their hard work our integration efforts and financial performance have been outstanding as doug mentioned we filed our earnings press release this morning in that release our first quarter  gaap net profit was  million or  per diluted share this compares to our first quarter  gaap net profit of  million or  per diluted share excluding special items we reported a net profit of  million in the first quarter  or  per share versus first quarter  net profit of  million or  per diluted share the significant yearoveryear decline in earnings is due primarily to a  or  million increase in first quarter  consolidated fuel expense our gaap first quarter  pretax profit was  million excluding net special items our first quarter pretax profit was  million resulting in a pretax margin of  our revenue performance continued to improve in the first quarter  as total operating revenues were up  yearoveryear to  billion passenger revenues were  billion up  on a yield improvement of  this marks the third consecutive quarter that our unit revenue performance has been the best of the six largest us carriers robert will give more detail on our revenue performance later on the call after im done cargo revenues were up  to  million due primarily to higher volume other operating revenues were  billion up  versus the same period last year due primarily to revenue associated with our new credit – cobranded credit card agreements total gaap operating expenses for the quarter were  billion up  versus the same period last year due primarily to higher fuel prices and salaries and benefit expense resulting from the investment in our team had our first quarter  fuel prices been flat to last years  per gallon our consolidated fuel expense would have been approximately  million lower first quarter casm was  up  yearoveryear excluding fuel and special items our consolidated casm was  or up  yearoveryear due primarily to salaries and benefits increases provided to our team members which is about worth three points higher depreciation and amortization resulting from increased capex in our aircraft – new aircraft about a point and maintenance timing of about a point we ended the quarter with approximately  billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of  billion and  billion of an undrawn revolver capacity the company also has restricted cash position of  million during the quarter our treasury team raised  million to finance  aircraft deliveries at a fixed rate blended cost of  we also repriced  billion term loan at an industry leading rate of libor plus  bps in addition we also closed two private mortgage transactions to finance four more aircraft in the first quarter of  the company returned  million to its shareholders including quarterly dividend payments totaling  million and the repurchase of  million of common stock or  million shares including share repurchases shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt our share count has dropped by over a third from  – excuse me  million at merger close in december  to  million shares as of march  the company did declare a dividend of  per share to be paid on may   to stockholders of record as of may   in april we also made a  million contribution to the companys defined benefit plans of which only  million was required which are now fully – the plans are now fully funded as of april   under the airline relief act in addition to our earnings release we also filed our investor update this morning consistent with our previous guidance in the second quarter of  we expect our systemwide asm growth to be up approximately  for the full year we expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately  and domestic consolidated capacity to be up approximately flat yearoveryear we expect international capacity to be up approximately  primarily due to the continuing impact of the  retrofit program and the yearoveryear impact of new pacific markets that we added in  over the past two years we have made significant investment in our people our product and our operation and as doug discussed in his remark we are offering midyear contract hourly base pay rate adjustments of approximately  to our flight attendants and an average of  to our pilots the estimated pretax income on the companys  salary and benefits expense would be approximately  million in  and  million in  and  so those are numbers that come off the base that we are at today so the total impact is  million we are happy to be able to fulfill the commitment we made to our team members and continue to believe these investments are vital to improving our product and operation with these pay rate adjustments we now expect our second quarter of  yearoveryear consolidated casm excluding special items to be up approximately  the mainline is in the range of  to  and the regional is in the  to  range we continue to expect higher yearoveryear fuel prices in  based on the forward curve as of april  we expect to pay between  and  per gallon consolidated in the second quarter of  which is approximately  higher yearoveryear using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with roberts revenue guidance we expect our second quarter  pretax margin excluding special items to be between  and  for the full year we expect gross aircraft capex to total  billion this includes the delivery of  mainline aircraft and  regional aircraft while retiring  mainline aircraft and reducing the overall regional fleet count by  aircraft in addition we expect to invest  billion in nonaircraft capex which includes projects to improve our product and operations as well as investments to complete our integration with respect to our fleet we announced in our release this morning that we reached a new amended agreement with airbus to defer delivery of the  a xwb aircraft the company has on order under the new amended delivery schedule we expect to take delivery of the first two a aircraft in late  instead of  as previously expected we now expect to take delivery of these as from  through  with an average deferral of  months in addition we also reached agreement with boeing to defer the delivery of two  aircraft from the second quarter of  to the first quarter of  these changes as well as the impact of changes to net predelivery payments reduced the companys planned capital expenditures by approximately  million in  and approximately  million in  and  and provides us with additional wide body capacity flexibility so in conclusion our team produced outstanding results in the first quarter and we look forward to more of the same as we move into the peak summer travel period i would like to again thank our  team members for the great service they provide to our customers with that i will turn it over to robert robert d isom  american airlines group inc thanks derek good morning everybody and thanks for joining us i would like to start by recognizing our  employees my colleagues have done outstanding work over the quarter and weve asked a lot of them over the last few years and theyve really delivered the first three months of the year we saw continued improvement across the enterprise including operational improvements fleet refresh customer experience and team member engagement we continue to make smart longterm investments in things like customer service training facilities improvements for both our employees and customers and technology to improve the overall customer experience these investments are starting to pay real dividends and were really excited about the trajectory that were on our operation continued to take big steps for the first quarter despite the impact of winter storm stella in march which disrupted the operations at stations in the southeast mideast and northeast american team members set new postmerger operational records in february for mainline ontime departures ontime arrivals and mishandled baggage we had eight days without a single mainline cancellation in the first quarter which is more than any year that weve had since the merger these accomplishments demonstrate our progress in creating a consistently reliable operation for our customers and team members while much of the integration work is already complete theres several noteworthy projects in the works that will refine our network and make us even stronger for our customers some of these projects include the march announcement of new service to eight cities from our hub in chicago as well as one new route in dallasfort worth and miami none of these  new additions will serve cities that have flights to other american hubs and have historically performed well in addition the bank patterns at our miami hub have been redesigned to facilitate better connections more efficient gate utilization and faster processing through customs and immigration one critical part of refining the network is focusing on the areas where we can maximize the value of our resources and were building up service in profitable cities improving the efficiency of the scheduling process and making structural changes at our hubs these are just a few of the examples of how were striving to invest our resources to create a seamless operation for our team members the best product for our customers and the highest return for our owners on the commercial side we rolled out the new basic economy product in  test markets in early march with encouraging results in the  launch market half of the eligible basic economy passengers have bought up to the main cabin which is right in line with our forecast we plan to continue to roll the product out to the remainder of our domestic and short haul international markets in a phased approach with more markets coming in may and june at the end of march we started selling premium economy with our first departures on may  we expect to have nine widebody aircraft configured with premium economy by the second quarter and more as time comes in the future we also announced an agreement to invest  million in chinas largest carrier china southern airlines later this year we expect to begin codeshare and interline agreements that will give our customers approximately  more destinations in china beyond beijing and shanghai lastly we entered into an arrangement with scandinavian airlines to obtain two slot pairs at londons heathrow airport strengthening americans presence at a key international gateway for american and our joint business partner british airways turning to revenue were very pleased with the revenue performance in the first quarter our first quarter consolidated prasm was up  and our first quarter trasm was up  this is the third consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry and not just the industry average but better than each of the six largest us carriers we believe that this outperformance can be attributed to the significant investments weve made in many years of business from our people to our product and to selling revenue management our aadvantage program and our mobile platform and aacom and customers are noticing we recorded our highest customer satisfaction rating since the merger the fifth consecutive month of sequential improvement and last week the harris poll named american airlines its full service airline brand of the year and earlier this year american was named the  airline of the year by air transport world turning to domestic our consolidated prasm was up  and importantly improved in every month in the quarter we have been implementing a number of revenue management initiatives for the premium cabin and they have proven very successful our sales initiatives are also bearing fruit we continue to see a positive trend in corporate share in the first quarter with strong results across the network this trend is continuing as we enter the second quarter as well our latin america performance overall was very strong with prasm up  although brazil led the way up  strength  broadbased also the balance of south america had positive unit revenue growth as well while other areas within the region had low single digit declines the atlantic was our weakest performing international entity with prasm down  but that number overstates the decline in actual performance it requires some explanation while our results did decline as a result of industry growth in a soft pricing environment half of the decline that we saw is due to an out of period adjustment that positively impacted last years results and another point and a half is due to the decline in uk currency and our exposure to that across the pacific prasm was positive this is the first positive result since the third quarter of  and is a sign that were turning the corner around our capacity buildout in the pacific we expect this region to continue to improve as we lap the additions of haneda sydney auckland and hong kong throughout the year first quarter cargo revenue improved  yearoveryear on strong growth a positive trend that weve seen since the latter half of  the focus that our cargo team members have placed on improving cargos operational performance and efforts to deliver bestinclass customer experience are paying off and being recognized by the industry american airlines cargo was voted air cargo news  cargo airline of the year for the third straight year and american is the only us based carrier to have been recognized with this honor in the awards year history so looking forward the revenue environment at american is very strong and we expect this momentum to continue the june quarter will mark the sixth quarter in a row of sequential improvement unit revenue and the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth based on published guidance we expect to outperform the industry in the second quarter as well for the fourth quarter in a row we continue to expect positive revenue improvements for each quarter throughout this year regionally our domestic prasm is expected to strengthen in the quarter due to a number of initiatives focused on premium cabin pricing and yield management and continuing gains through our investments in our sales organizations in latin america we expect another quarter of strong yearoveryear improvements with every entity having positive unit revenue the pacific entity is expected to perform in line with the first quarter lastly the atlantic region has continued to show modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror events however it remains challenged as low priced carriers continue to grow and the british pound remains weak as we look to the second quarter and beyond were excited about our operational commercial investments and we expect our second quarter total revenue for asm to be up  to  yearoveryear we rolled out our new basic economy product our premium economy product as well and early results are encouraging while we have a lot of work to do we look forward to reporting on future successes with that id like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operation instructions and we will take our first question from kevin crissey with citi william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hello kevin kevin crissey  citigroup global markets inc hey good morning thanks can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue having worked at jetblue i can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yeah kevin what im certain of is that we – the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have and im equally certain that our ability to do that while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that im certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult so i dont know that i can directly answer your question but im highly confident that it is correlated and would note again this isnt about us making a bet that oh if we can go get to rates that are – pay levels that are higher than others that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others i dont think i would make that argument this is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines a commitment again that weve made consistently with each and every contract but in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on fiveyear terms which is also worth noting longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today it just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didnt feel right to any of us so i feel good about that commitment its a commitment were happy to make not just in this case but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates our base pay rates versus competitors other airlines and theres still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations you should expect us to correct it because thats the right thing to do for our team and i think – and i do believe kevin what happens so long as we do that we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and thats the best way to take care of our shareholder kevin crissey  citigroup global markets inc thanks but isnt this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at youve taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesnt feel like what well run companies do william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yes i would beg to differ again given the experience levels here and what our teams have been through and look were comfortable with the commitment youre right in one sense i suppose that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry the answer is youve got to go ask others in the industry because were indeed not leading this charge were just making sure were staying – were catching up so where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future but look i feel i think again i think this is – what youre seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected and i think look – and i think its largely corrected we were encouraged to hear delta apparently at their investor day mentioned that they put in place a  pay increase for all their team for all their nonunion members which at delta is everyone i believe except their pilots and their dispatchers so the vast majority of the airline they increased  again this year but note on their investor day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future so i dont know that i agree with your premise but i certainly agree with our commitment and that is were going to make sure because its important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged and its hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and dont do it as well at other companies getting compensated more on an hourly basis so thats important to us it will continue to be important i dont think its dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their inflight product you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that were taking care of our customers and these are the people to take care of our customers the people that are on the frontline not just our pilots and flight attendants our mechanics our fleet service employees our reservations agents our gate agents every single one of them deserves the same commitment and were happy to make it kevin crissey  citigroup global markets inc okay thank you william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks kevin operator moving next to jamie baker with jpmorgan jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody doug you have this plan to achieve pretax profits midcycle of  billion over the last year or so it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat consensus estimates certainly dont embrace that outcome and now of course youre adding additional costs to your internal forecast when do you think youll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yeah jamie i think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what youre talking about so let me try jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc oh im sorry william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thats quite all right and i dont know your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what youre talking about but ill try anyway jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc when it doesnt snow william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yes that did make it rough so look and importantly i need to restate it because – i would restate it slightly differently than what you just said heres what i said and heres what we do and its a really important point so im glad you raised it we believe the – we have a company today that over – on average over time in todays current environment should generate pretax earnings of around  billion now look its a volatile business we all know that that hasnt changed while that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before the fact is its still volatile so we think it will average  billion over time we think the better years will look around like  billion and the lesser years will look around like  billion but over time we should expect this company can generate over time  billion now look that is not just a statement that we make that is how we compensate our every one of the employees at american airlines that get an annual bonus so everyone essentially manager level and above thats why this is important we use that formula i just said to fund our annual incentive pool and weve done that since the merger now again the  billion and  billion have moved around a little bit as weve gotten more comfortable with postmerger earnings but the  billion hasnt changed since the day of the merger and maybe it will change one day but were not changing it – were certainly – nothing about what were seeing today leads us to believe that should change so thats what i reported to you all is that – thats what we think about the earnings prospects of this company and not only do we think that thats how we fund our incentive pool so again the way the incentive pool works not that you care that much about our executive compensation but i think its really important to what you think about our expectations for the business we fund the incentive pool by telling the team look if we have a year where we make  billion were going to fund the incentive pool at target if we have a year where we make  billion were going to fund it at half of target below that theres no bonus and if we have a year where we make  billion thats the maximum which is double the bonus so – and youre right no one on the street i think is forecasting  billion for american this year but we didnt change that formula for the team so this – if indeed the street is right this will be one of those years thats slightly worse and there will be years in the future that are slightly better whats important about this point is that if we are right and again were not just throwing out numbers here this is how were incentivizing our management team if were right our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view if were right and this company is going to – over time going to average  billion pretax really easy – really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me but ill go to the simple math  billion taxed is  billion  billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around – has a market cap of about  billion thats eight times what im telling you i think is our steady state earnings eight times steady state earnings when the average sp company over the last something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like help me dan  times feels like people dont believe the  million sic  billion  number and thats fine but we do so thats why were so bullish on the company and the investments weve made today only strengthen that view we dont look at that and think oh gosh now its  million harder to get to  billion we look at this and say this reinforces our view that were going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments were making and we feel even better about that in the longterm so thats what i said and thats what we still believe jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc as part of that it looks like it still takes considerably more american employees to get the job done than at delta and its tough for me to accurately do that analysis theres some outsourcing issues we have to account for but there do seem to be opportunities for american to become more efficient and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe thats just my interpretation can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency william douglas parker  american airlines group inc well look i would say this when you say its difficult for you to do that i would argue its almost impossible for you to compare those numbers there are enormous differences in the amount of work that american does inhouse versus what some other airlines do outside so you wouldnt see it in the head count or in the salaries youd see it instead in their numbers and their outside services and we try to do similar analysis and you cant get there i dont think but ill tell you this as is the case in most mergers when youre running two airlines you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger you can eliminate and we still have some of that in place but rather than trying to quantify it because i dont know that we know what it is yet andor how were going to manage it and over what period of time i would just point you to the guidance that derek rattled off on our cost trends we had casm ex fuel in the first quarter here of  the second quarter we say  to  the third quarter we say  to  fourth quarter we say  to  that includes – again those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night so thats a rapidly declining yearoveryear increase in cost and while were in no position to start giving  guidance yet i would certainly expect that that trend would continue into  and that is that number of  to  and fourth quarter  would be even lower for the full year of  so its coming down the rate of growth is certainly slowing but look we recognize that our job is to make sure were running the airline efficiently and we believe were doing so today there are some things that because were still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than well be able to do over time but well make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can i think youll start to see most of that in  and again nothing to report now on how big that will be because i dont think we know i know we dont know because i dont know jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc okay yeah doug i appreciate you taking my questions this morning thanks william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks jamie operator well go next to andrew didora with bank of america andrew george didora  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning everyone william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hey andrew andrew george didora  bank of america merrill lynch doug on that note in terms of the  billion kind of run rate pretax earnings i guess when you consider that and given the permanent stepup in labor does it change your view at all of capital allocation with these higher fixed costs would you consider more debt paydown over share repurchases going forward and if not why william douglas parker  american airlines group inc the short answer is no and again i come back to the overriding point which is this increase in our nearterm expenses in no way changes our view about our longterm prospects indeed it gives us more confidence that theyre achievable so nothing about this makes us think anything about – and again let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme – a recurring theme that im having trouble getting across we look at this longer term than – and on the longterm this was an expense that was coming theres no way when we got to  and did new contracts of course that were going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap so we accelerated an expense again not something we do lightly and not something we had to do something we thought we should do but none of this to us feels like any sort of change in the longterm prospects and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation we think about it in the longterm so no no change in that were really confident with our current capital allocation we think were doing the right thing for our shareholders were happy yet again as derek noted to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today and so we feel good about that we think we – another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is yeah our debt is higher but its because our assets are better another point that i think sometimes gets lost maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet and that fleet is a lot more valuable theres a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt of course so we feel good about the capital allocation and we will continue to do whats best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward andrew george didora  bank of america merrill lynch got it understood i guess maybe kind of changing gears a little bit maybe one for robert can you talk a bit more about what youre seeing on the transatlantic given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all and kind of what are your expectations for demand on transatlantic as we head through the summer robert d isom  american airlines group inc ill let don give some more color but were optimistic about what were seeing close in but as you note have concerns about capacity in the long run don donald b casey  american airlines inc yes i mean we – clearly theres a lot of capacity growth and theres a pretty active pricing environment the industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where weve been more – a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers we do have easing comps so as we go forward i think were going to see the comps get a bit easier we also ran last year at relatively low load factors us point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year although were seeing some weakness coming out of the uk overall the us point of sale seems very robust this year and we expect as we go through the summer that were going to run materially higher load factors than last year andrew george didora  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you everyone william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks operator well take our next question from hunter keay with wolfe research william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hey hunter hunter k keay  wolfe research llc yes good morning so i know maybe its a question for derek since derek is the one that made this comment last quarter i know you said obviously its early to guide to  casm but just last quarter you said you think youd be able to keep casm ex under  over the next couple of years im not sure if you were referring to an average number or each of the two years but given the new labor cost increase do you still feel like thats doable derek j kerr  american airlines group inc yes i still feel like thats doable for each of the two years not just over the two years but for each of the two years hunter k keay  wolfe research llc all right good and then just to be totally clear i think robert you said you expect continuing positive improvements in rasm each quarter this year you werent saying the q growth rate was going to get better than q or just saying its going to be above zero right robert d isom  american airlines group inc yes hunter k keay  wolfe research llc okay do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how youre thinking about q anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness or capacity or anything youre lapping just to kind of give us an early thought how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate robert d isom  american airlines group inc no theres really – there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in july that had an impact on some of the bookings through august in particular october actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year but other than that i think its nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of  hunter k keay  wolfe research llc okay thank you william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks hunter operator well take our next question from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi hey thanks william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hi duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi just on the combination of capex and pension funding can you walk us through that this year  and  william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yes derek j kerr  american airlines group inc yes so in this year well have  billion in combination so capex of  billion pensions we did  million in  capex – aircraft capex is  billion and pension right now were forecasting  billion but one thing i want to note on that thats an assumption that the mortality tables do change if the mortality tables do not change thatll be reduced by about  million so we have the most conservative number in there so its  billion in aircraft capex and  billion in pension payments and then in  aircraft capex is  billion and pension payment is right at a  billion duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi and is that  billion level – for a longerterm model is that  billion level kind of what we should be thinking about derek j kerr  american airlines group inc no it drops in – in  it drops to  million and  it drops to  million and those are all assuming the mortality table changes if those dont change then those could be modified but it goes down to  million in  and  so id say the run rate is more  million past to the  timeframe duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi okay and we should add  billion in nonaircraft to those numbers derek j kerr  american airlines group inc yes duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi okay derek j kerr  american airlines group inc at least through  and then i think itll come down to about  billion to  billion in  duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi thanks for that detail have you looked at – i know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that have you analyzed that is that something you could even do given the higher leverage derek j kerr  american airlines group inc we have analyzed it we could do it if we want we think were – we dont have any requirement to do any payment until  and dont believe we should go forward with that i think the  billion were doing in  will get us to  funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to so thats the reason were going to  we only have to do i think its  million in  so the  billion is significantly over what were required to do in order for us to get to that  funded once the airline relief act comes off so well its similar to what theyre doing we just dont need to do it until  duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi thanks very much william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks duane operator well go next to rajeev lalwani with morgan stanley william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hello rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc good morning thanks for the time william douglas parker  american airlines group inc good morning rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc robert and don thisll probably be for you you – your updated rasm guide points to sequential improvement thats relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in q and youve highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there what do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration given all the things that youve got going on robert d isom  american airlines group inc im not so sure id characterize it like that because in all honesty what were seeing is a lot of demand for our premium cabin and that i think is a sign that the kind of investments that were making are taking root we see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well and i think that our outperformance is going to continue it – weve got a good impressive string here and thats what we see going forward don donald b casey  american airlines inc yes william douglas parker  american airlines group inc go ahead don im sorry donald b casey  american airlines inc yeah i mean i – first of all lets not i guess confuse guidance with performance guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance so well see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter although on the – from a guidance perspective this looks like a – sequentially were not increasing as much but this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody elses and so well just have to wait and see where the actuals come in in terms of yearoveryear versus others william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yeah thanks don thats what i was going to say and again the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance if youre asking us to forecast the gap versus the others were certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter we just think we probably have – we may have different biases in our forecasting ours might be more conservative than theirs but if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes thats i dont know well look at why that happened if that happens but we certainly dont expect that rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc point taken and the other question a bit more nuanced can you talk about the outlook for the latam market robert i think you provided some color for q but i was looking for more just beyond as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand what south america is looking like mexico caribbean et cetera donald b casey  american airlines inc okay this is don we had obviously a very solid first quarter performance in latin america brazil led the way we had positive unit revenue in all of south america and low single digit declines in the rest of the south america market as we look forward into the second quarter we see continuing strength actually strength improving and in the second quarter we expect a positive yearoveryear unit revenue in every entity in latin america that it looks very very robust at this point rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc and just broader puts and takes as we look beyond q as far as what youre seeing or thinking on the supply side donald b casey  american airlines inc were not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in latam overall were seeing affirmative growth in mexico but were seeing a lot of demand growth as well but nothing that we see thats going to change our current outlook rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc very helpful thank you gentlemen operator well go next to darryl genovesi with ubs darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc hi guys thanks for the time hey doug youve alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years i mean i guess i was just hoping that youd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today i mean is it network or is it ontime performance and can you help us understand sort of what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps arent as addressable william douglas parker  american airlines group inc ill let robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are go ahead robert robert d isom  american airlines group inc darryl id just like to point out that i think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments weve been making but in all honesty a lot of catchup and i do think is – will benefit us and its going to be unique to american some of the things that are just taking root now as weve talked about we are still confident that between our basic and premium economy products that were talking about a  billion worth of incremental revenue which is sizable i think everybody – i think you know that we havent really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying thats been consistent out in the marketplace and so this year we will finally have a lieflat product across all international entities which is fantastic we think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that i think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well don and team have been making improvements in revenue management and i want to underscore the work that were doing with our sales team as well and id like to say that a lot of thats baked into the current numbers but im glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc okay so you think all that stuff and i realize that it is difficult to see this but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that thats enough to offset both the discount for instance from delta that youre achieving today as well as what id call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network thats also causing you some difficulty robert d isom  american airlines group inc when we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing we think that that will definitely make us competitive darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc okay thanks very much guys william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks darryl operator and please limit yourself to one question and one followup question well go next to joseph denardi with stifel joseph denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thank you very much so doug back in  when you were running airways you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth weve spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a  times ebitda multiple on it that puts the valuation somewhere around  billion to  billion your market cap is half that so two questions would that surprise you that valuation and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then why doesnt it make sense to do the same thing now william douglas parker  american airlines group inc well first off i cant believe i said that in  but if you say i did okay this has been an issue at least from our perspective is its part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection ive never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out – maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at but so anyway rather than trying to figure out why i said something in  ill tell you what we think now which is yes well first up to your larger question would it surprise me to learn thats the value of the advantage program i would have to say yes because that is greater than the value of american airlines in total as we sit here today but i am not arguing with you you guys are better at doing valuations than we are and the market will decide i find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value but again thats something that you guys can figure out better than we can but actually i should be careful on that if we believe that then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out what i believe is the advantage program is really valuable its an incredible part of our airline its a significant reason that we feel so good about our future and we maximize the value for our shareholders and whether or not that is done inhouse or in a separate entity thats going to be the case and the value will be created so we agree with you theres a lot of value there we agree with you that perhaps thats another reason the airline is undervalued i just think were undervalued for all sorts of reasons i think people dont appreciate whats happened in this industry or this airline and how its going to make a difference in the long term and thats where were focused as i told you last time we agree with your pointing this out and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program but its part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that were happy with the way its being managed and the value its producing and its in our – in the results of the airline today and in the future joseph denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay i mean i guess doug i would just say that the past two years at jamies conference youve made your – making the lead presentation and talked about why theres less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isnt a part of that so im just wondering do you not mention it because you dont believe that its an important part of improving cyclicality or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you dont talk about the airline cobrand card william douglas parker  american airlines group inc okay fair enough its not that so yes okay fair enough we should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams so noted joseph denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks doug william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks operator moving on to helane becker with cowen  company helane becker  cowen  co llc thanks operator hi team thanks for taking the question as i think about your domestic route network i know youre focused on los angeles and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what youre doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on and then when i think about the growth thats occurring in fort lauderdale and the other side of the country you guys have the big hub in miami i get it in latin america and so on but do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues william douglas parker  american airlines group inc steve johnson will take the la piece stephen l johnson  american airlines group inc sure thanks helane just with respect to facilities in los angeles we – i think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year we actually opened the connector between the bradley terminal and terminal  which is in use i got to use it personally just the other day its a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa and thats been a big hit with our customers then very recently we moved our limited operation that was in terminal  to terminal  and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between terminal  and terminal  so those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use and then finally were in negotiations with lawa for a longterm lease at lax that will change the face of our facilities there those negotiations are confidential beyond that so i wont say anymore but were hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks robert d isom  american airlines group inc yes and helane ill talk a little bit more about south florida so we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets and so theres always appropriate consideration but look fort lauderdale its a nice local market operation we view miami differently we do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for american but not just american of any carrier to the south america weve got a nice position there and a lot of the work that were doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart and you may have noticed recently thats actually helped us in markets like cuba where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub and were going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation helane becker  cowen  co llc okay great thank you william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks helane operator moving next to michael linenberg with deutsche bank william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hey michael michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc hey thanks guys just two quick ones here bob you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic prasm any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on donald b casey  american airlines inc its don i mean to be honest with you michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc hi don donald b casey  american airlines inc we saw improvement across the board for our – in corporate markets and this again marks a kind of highwater mark for us since the merger and in the first quarter we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just second just a clarification on the capex deferral to derek is that – so is that  million or  billion im not sure if its  million in two years or  million per year derek j kerr  american airlines group inc  million per year so its  billion over the three years michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc perfect thanks operator savi syth with raymond james has our next question savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc hey good morning a question on the – in the last few years i think american has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure be it south america be it some of the aggressive pricing on lowcost carrier markets and we are seeing that reverse i was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see or how much more there is to go and maybe some that might not come back in the nearterm robert d isom  american airlines group inc okay i mean basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us right the southwest growth at love field the occ growth brazil venezuela but we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year and so brazils clearly one area where were seeing some yearoveryear improvement but the rest of that really doesnt really drive any yearoveryear change so the real value were seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance although brazil is a piece of that its really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace its the new airplanes its the new product its the restructuring of our advantage program its the investment were making in sales and the investment and change were making in revenue management all the things were doing which is a long list right is really whats driving the benefit its not just some lucky fortunate yearoveryear comparison its really kind of fundamental the fundamentals that are getting better for us savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc sorry and i meant not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw finally a followup on mikes question on corporate was – are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now yearoveryear is that firmly in that trend robert d isom  american airlines group inc actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up in the first quarter of this year we saw yields actually for corporate flattish savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc great thanks very much operator moving on to jack atkins with stephens jack atkins  stephens inc hey good morning everyone thanks for the time just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there robert d isom  american airlines group inc so those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis and again some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that weve done with our wide body our  reconfiguration program where were moving to a standard configuration so thats on that front and we think that theres opportunities with the narrow bodies as well and that is something that youll see in  and beyond jack atkins  stephens inc okay and then just kind of following up on that as well thinking about your prepared comments on basic and premium economy just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how youre thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by yearend and then just what sort of revenue impact thats expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging robert d isom  american airlines group inc so in terms of basic thats something that we anticipate for – it will be something that we offer throughout our network jack atkins  stephens inc yes robert d isom  american airlines group inc so for basic its really just the timing of the rollout for us right so we have more markets coming in may and june these are still i guess i would view as kind of test markets the next two tranches similar to the first tranche but were going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually right and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing but were committed to roll this out everywhere and were quite encouraged by the initial results premium economy is the next thing and we dont really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our rollout of premium economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year so we still kind of consider what were doing right now kind of a test and were very focused on this a lot of it is channel education were the first us airline to have this product and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution all of our selling channels know what the product is and we need to make sure we work with our thirdparty distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems so people will understand what it is and what theyre buying and thats what were focused on right now for premium economy but again it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year jack atkins  stephens inc okay thanks again for the time william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks operator and brandon oglenski with barclays has our next question sorry dan mckenzie with buckingham research has our next question william douglas parker  american airlines group inc hey dan dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc hey good morning thanks guys doug help us understand why the  billion pretax target is realistic from your perspective youre saying its the right hurdle for executive compensation and i know you youre not pulling that out of thin air why is that so from where you sit what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years william douglas parker  american airlines group inc i think robert laid those out pretty well he can lay them out again for you if youd like as to what the initiatives are and as to the value themselves we mentioned that as well robert d isom  american airlines group inc basic and premium economy we mentioned dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc right so look that is the value that gives us confidence all you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per asm as soon as we close that you easily get to numbers like  billion as a run rate number so look but thats not how we go about coming up with this number the way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where american airlines is positioned in that industry both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than theyve ever been before and based upon that view thats what this feel – thats what the company feels like to us i dont want to portend or pretend that we go and that – those numbers i said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis thats laid out for the next  years its where we believe this company is today and look the facts support it since the time of the merger we have had earnings in that range this is a worse year than others and its still in the range one of the things i do like to point out to people when they – part of the reason – part of the explanation at least i get sometimes dan from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we – why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries the reason i get is well its because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things youve done in the past to eliminate value and as someone whos been around through all those years i know what those things are and were and the things that are rattled off as you know youre going to grow faster than – once you start making money youll grow faster than demand once you start making money youll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money and theyll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders fuel prices will go up and you guys wont be able to react i would just point out this in the last three years all those things have happened and that is unit revenues of – capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years and as a result unit revenues have fallen at rates that we havent seen in this business since  probably more than theyve ever fallen over a twoyear period at any point in time so unit revenues have declined because weve added more capacity than there is demand employee pay has increased at a rate that no one – that has never been seen before and so thats happened fuel prices indeed have increased from where they were a year ago at   so all that stuff has happened and yet here we are – and indeed that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower but while they are – theyre lower theyre at the lower end of the range i talked about – actually not lower end of the range – just lower than target so i feel really good about that target over time all those things have happened all the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened i dont think those are any surprises by the way i dont think thats bad management i think all those things are the right things to do the reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business and when fuel prices fell as much as they did the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity the wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this – how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival so look all of that stuffs happened all the things that i think people were worried about weve done and we still have a business that is producing returns like its never seen before and also i believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you – where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry but look we will see over time but i cant stress enough how bullish we are on the future dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc yeah thanks for that and i guess maybe i didnt ask my question – and maybe id have to wait for the investor day but i guess i kind of want william douglas parker  american airlines group inc also you – i rattled off on my tirade and i didnt – and we didnt answer your question so robert what are initiatives for dan robert d isom  american airlines group inc no i just – yeah the fortunate thing again as i said before is i think weve got some catchup items and a number of things that we can improve on so the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through so as i take a look right we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now some of them have been held up by integration but the good news is is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet i mentioned to you about basic economy we think that that has legs throughout our system and its just in its infancy we think that premium economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network i mentioned to you about widebody interior improvements notably the s in terms of finally getting lieflat and density thats appropriate i think that as i said we have narrowbody density opportunities as well to pursue don has talked a lot about the rm improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today we are just now getting started on our relaunch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that quite frankly has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things we are redesigning our aadvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well and as weve talked in the past we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well the list is long and again were just getting started and a lot of this fortunately benefit is going to come to american dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc okay thanks william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks dan dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc all right thanks guys william douglas parker  american airlines group inc no go ahead you got another question dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc well i was just going to say taking what you rattled off over the course of the cycle these initiatives are worth what in terms – x billion dollars  billion  billion if you can just help size it for us or again maybe we have to wait for the investor day im not sure derek j kerr  american airlines group inc wait for the investor day we havent – outside of basic and premium economy we havent sized it and well be happy to shed more light on it later this year dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc okay thanks guys william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks dan operator and well now go to brandon oglenski with barclays brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc yes good morning guys thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here sorry theres a few overlapping today but doug i missed your opening remarks here but youve been a huge proponent that this industry has changed we just heard you respond to dans question about how the industry did add capacity we are paying up labor earnings and margins have come down for two years now so if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company dont we need to reduce earnings volatility and part of that process is obviously managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market so i dont want to come across as being unrespectful to your front line employees which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs upfront margins need to come down now but trust us whats the inflection point that drives that better in the future william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yes thanks brandon thanks for asking and again with – i did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but ill try again the – i do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be and more importantly the level of earnings at which we – the mean level from which you vacillate is much much higher and i dont – and that is different this time and its an enormous difference and i dont think thats been appreciated so but as to your volatility point again this is what were doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be for two and a half years paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines who were doing the same functions is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile this is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur and once you get to that level i think youll see as you do in other mature businesses that labor costs certainly one you get efficiencies over time as good businesses do but two labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation and i think its what youll see in this business but all of us had to get to a point where we got to what really team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive so thats what i think is happening here it doesnt affect by any means our view about the longterm value indeed as i said at the outset it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we cant do that without an excited and engaged team were making huge progress in that regard weve got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team so that didnt seem right to us and thats – so when we see things that dont feel right we correct them we dont live by contracts we have in place and thats what we did and we feel extremely good about that and it makes us feel even better about the longterm prospects brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc i appreciate that response doug and wall street can be fickle so hopefully this works out william douglas parker  american airlines group inc okay itll work for the long term thanks operator well pause for just a moment well go first to andrea ahles with fort worth startelegram william douglas parker  american airlines group inc good morning andrea andrea ahles  fort worth startelegram good morning doug this question might be more for robert i was wondering if you could talk on the basic economy side you mentioned how from a revenue standpoint how customers are – or  of them are choosing main cabin over  and theyre offered both but i was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of how is it going for your gate agents your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past march how has that gone so far on those  routes robert d isom  american airlines group inc well thanks andrea i think – look were benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning so we spent months and months prior to launch prior to announcement and did extensive training and fortunately i think our metered approach is working and what were seeing is that by and large our customers understand the restrictions that are on the basic economy fare and are complying with what our practice is at the gate and so were not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about and i think that thats really evidenced by the kind of results that were producing from an operational perspective there hasnt been any impact to reliability there hasnt been any impact on ontime departures and i think what youd hear from our inflight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft so overall im really pleased but were going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that were not surprised andrea ahles  fort worth startelegram are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced when you have fliers that maybe typically dont fly as often maybe this is their onceayear sort of trip and arent as familiar with the changes are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate robert d isom  american airlines group inc well well be ready for it and i think thats the key is making sure that we let people – making sure that people are clear on what theyre purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible and at the end of the day again given the loads expected and strong demand we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carryon bags andrea ahles  fort worth startelegram all right thank you operator well go next to mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news mary schlangenstein  bloomberg news good morning hey this might be for derek im not sure i wanted to ask is there a place in your fleet for the a derek j kerr  american airlines group inc yes no i think there is i mean its – but were going to – we had a lot of widebodies come in we had s and we had as coming on top of each other so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our widebodies are so at this point in time yes so we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a – didnt have too many widebodies coming to us at one point in time mary schlangenstein  bloomberg news are you considering at all maybe converting those to another airbus model derek j kerr  american airlines group inc not at this time no mary schlangenstein  bloomberg news okay thank you william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks mary operator moving next to ted reed with thestreet ted reed  thestreet inc thank you i have two questions about consumer perception the first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low and i just wonder if you made – if that was a consideration in these pay increases william douglas parker  american airlines group inc well look weve been working on this for sixseven months so if youre talking about recent incidents absolutely not if youre – if youre asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers absolutely i absolutely believe that but yes if youre asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times absolutely not weve been working on this for several months ted reed  thestreet inc all right thank you second thing in the case of the stroller incident it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger daniel e cravens  american airlines group inc you lost us on that but no ted reed  thestreet inc any reaction to the – to the video and the way the passengers – the way that the male passenger acted elise r eberwein  american airlines group inc which video are you talking about ted reed  thestreet inc the stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously william douglas parker  american airlines group inc yes ted we dont have any comment on that were – the – weve commented on the incident itself it was – and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved we have an amazing team of people in american airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today and they are out there doing incredible things every day we sometimes because of our policies and procedures put them in difficult situations we are going to work to make sure we minimize those but we are really happy with the job they do and we are focused – and very proud of the job they do and obviously our customers – we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers so anyway thats where we are on that and nothing new to report ted reed  thestreet inc all right thank you william douglas parker  american airlines group inc thanks ted operator moving on to conor shine with the dallas morning news conor shine  the dallas morning news inc good morning guys excuse me my question was just on basic economy again do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers youd attract who might otherwise fly just  other low cost carrier or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what youre able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end donald b casey  american airlines inc this is don casey the value comes – we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on american because of the great product that we have and under the current distribution models in the industry its very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare so by having two different products and different product attributes this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them and we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on american and the great product that we have and if all theyre really interested in is just having the lowest fair thats the only thing thats really important to them then we have a good product for them as well conor shine  the dallas morning news inc thank you operator well go next to dawn gilbertson with the arizona republic dawn gilbertson  the arizona republic inc good morning robert you mentioned or you and don mentioned expansion of basic economy in may and june can you talk about those routes or markets robert d isom  american airlines group inc were not – were not naming any of those right now but again dawn this is – this is something that eventually will be out to the entire network dawn gilbertson  the arizona republic inc youre not – you wont name them and may starts next week donald b casey  american airlines inc thats when theyre going to get loaded so youll see them soon dawn gilbertson  the arizona republic inc okay why so secretive william douglas parker  american airlines group inc theres no secrets behind it this is the way that were launching and youll see more about it as time comes dawn gilbertson  the arizona republic inc okay thanks operator and that concludes the questionandanswer session ill turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing remarks daniel e cravens  american airlines group inc thank you all very much for your
