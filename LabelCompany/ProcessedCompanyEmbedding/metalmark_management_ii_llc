trends in certain industries — enabling us to anticipate and stay ahead of changes in the market we capitalize on this through platform investing in a platform investment we either create a startup company by meeting with a management team writing a business plan and putting together capital or we take an existing company and transform it — growing it organically or otherwise taking it to the next level often through strategic acquisitions starting a firm de novo requires a different level of commitment thought process and degree of skill than typical private equity transactions it involves extensive research leveraging of our proprietary relationships a longterm commitment and an ability to be actively involved in the issues that occur when acquiring and transitioning facilities building workforces and managing development plans our success in these investments is evidence of our ability to be a creative force that builds longterm value in our portfolio companies at times as much as onethird to onehalf of our portfolio has been made up of these types of arrangements these case studies demonstrate our experience creating a leading hospital management company
