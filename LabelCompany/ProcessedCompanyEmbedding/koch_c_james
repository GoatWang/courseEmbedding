wife divorced married cynthia a fisher a biotechnology entrepreneur children four two from each marriage education harvard university ba  jdmba  addresses office —boston beer co  arlington st boston ma  career instructor for outward bound – business consultant boston consulting group – founded boston beer co  sidelights jim koch gave up a lucrative career as a business consultant to become a brewer his family had been brewers back to his great–great–grandfather but kochs parents had steered him to a different profession koch pronounced cook founded boston beer company in  and brought american drinkers a domestic beer samuel adams that competed with imports on taste and quality kochs marketing skill made samuel adams the best–selling craft beer in the united states koch began by aggressively promoting his beer at bar after bar trying to persuade boston innkeepers to stock samuel adams now he presides over a company with sales of more than  million at what might be called the largest small brewer in the country a fanatic for taste koch still personally samples every batch of samuel adams koch was born in cincinnati ohio to a family of german descent his ancestors had made beer in the old country and his father was a brewer for a cincinnati beer–maker koch did well in school and was accepted to prestigious harvard university after completing an undergraduate degree in government koch went on to a combined program at harvard that offered both a law degree and a masters in business it was a particularly difficult course of study that attracted some stellar candidates one of kochs classmates was mitt romney who went on to become governor of massachusetts but koch was dissatisfied with life at harvard at the age of  he felt he had done nothing in his life yet but go to school he wanted different kinds of experience so he left his graduate program and became an instructor at the outdoor adventure school outward bound outward bound was a rigorous wilderness program that taught often troubled teens how to survive the outdoors work in a group make good decisions and assess risks koch was keenly aware that he held the lives of his students in his hands during his four years with outward bound he traveled across the west gaining insights that helped him later in his business career in a story he wrote for the new york times in  koch recalled how his outward bound groups always used a lot of nylon string so he started out giving everyone more string than they would need just in case that group failed to take care of its string and ended up with too little for his next group he doled out less string than necessary this group learned to conserve the essential asset and finished the adventure with string left over though it was years later that koch started his company it stuck with him that it was possible to do more with less koch eventually returned to harvard and finished his double degree he then got a job with a business consulting company called the boston consulting group he worked there for five years but he found he was still not doing what he really wanted he decided to quit the consulting group and invest his savings in brewing beer his father a lifelong brewery worker was appalled when koch told his story for readers digest he said when i told dad i was hoping hed put his arm around me and get misty about reviving tradition instead he said jim that is the dumbest thing ive ever heard yet kochs plan was far from naïve he had carefully researched the market and he believed beer drinkers were ready for a good domestic beer in the early s sales of imported beer were growing european beers had a reputation for better quality than mass–market american brands such as coors and miller yet european brewers frequently resorted to preservatives and fillers in order to make their products last for overseas shipment at the same time the united states market was seeing a flood of domestic beers made by very small brewers called microbreweries while these microbrews often won big on taste their makers rarely had the marketing know–how to get their beers to a wide audience plus most microbrewers had made large financial commitments to their physical plants and had little money left over to push for wider distribution or to run advertising koch planned to make a fine–quality domestic beer that would compete with both imports and microbrews but he aimed to grow beyond a regional market and become a national player koch started out with  of his own savings plus  in loans from family and friends instead of buying a brewery with his capital koch took his great–great–grandfathers authentic german beer recipe to a contract brewer in pittsburgh he named his creation samuel adams after the revolutionary war hero and brewer though he saved an estimated  million by not building his own brewery samuel adams still turned out to be an expensive beer using the quality ingredients koch insisted on samuel adams retailed for about  percent more than leading imported beers this made it very difficult to sell koch roamed boston serving samples to bartenders and bar owners while telling them about his new company and his family tradition koch claimed he sometimes had to make  visits to a bar before he could persuade the owner to carry his brand boston beer began advertising heavily in  unlike other beer advertising which relied primarily on images of attractive happy drinkers koch depicted samuel adams as simply a quality brew early advertising also emphasized that samuel adams was a domestic brand with slogans like declare your independence from foreign beer perhaps because it was so different from established beer advertising the samuel adams campaign attracted a lot of media attention the brand caught on and in  it went into markets across the country sales grew by over  percent that year by  kochs company was bringing in  million in sales and samuel adams was the best–selling specialty beer in the united states sales continued to grow and kochs company was bringing in about  million by the mid–s koch took boston beer company public in  koch told gerry khermouch of businessweek that he could have sold the company any time he wanted and never worked again but that did not appeal to him what would i do if i did sell he asked khermouch id go looking for a brewery to buy so i could launch my own brand even as his company grew to have hundreds of employees koch remained intimately connected with the brewing process the company began experimenting with unusual beers in the late s including pricey extra–strong brews and special seasonal flavors koch confided to sarah theodore of beverage industry that he still tasted every batch boston beer produced im still the protector of the beer he told her not only did he make sure his companys beer tasted good straight out of the cask but he traveled to bars restaurants and convenience stores to check how the beer was selling and make sure draft kegs were the right temperature and not beyond the sell date after two years of research and development kochs company brought out a light low–calorie beer in  light beers were often disdained by the kind of beer connoisseurs who relished samuel adams and other craft beers but sam adams light aimed for a different kind of flavor than the typical light beer and it was evidently very successful sales at boston beer climbed more than ten percent the year the light brew came out by  koch was in his fifties and celebrated  years as head of boston beer he was clearly not ready to retire and brushed off talk of selling the company his share of the company was then worth about  million he was keen on introducing samuel adams to younger beer drinkers who often bypassed the brand for more exotic–sounding microbrews he continued to tinker with beer recipes brewing what he believed to be the worlds strongest beer a –proof special edition to keep himself interested sources

catalyst in the development of marketbased management in particular he expresses admiration for ludwig von mises’ book human action as well as the writings of friedrich hayek koch said the shortterm

aggravates the problem too many businesses have successfully lobbied for special favors and treatment by seeking mandates for their products subsidies in the form of cash payments from the government and regulations and tariffs to keep more efficient competitors at bay crony capitalism is much easier than competing in an open market but it erodes our overall standard of living and stifles

fact that koch industries is a major ethanol producer he is quoted as saying “the first thing we’ve got to get rid of is business welfare and entitlements” regarding government regulation koch has written that he expects his employees to cooperate fully with the law regardless of personal views we needed to be uncompromising with our workforce to expect  percent of our employees to comply  percent of the time with complex and everchanging government mandates striving to comply with every law does not mean agreeing with every law but even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive we must first comply only then from a credible position can we enter into a dialogue with regulatory agencies to demonstrate alternatives that are more beneficial if these efforts fail we can then join with others in using education andor political efforts to change the law in an april  wall street journal oped koch wrote the fundamental concepts of dignity respect equality

successfully lobbied for special favors and treatment by seeking mandates for their products subsidies in the form of cash payments from the government and regulations and tariffs to keep more efficient competitors at bay crony capitalism is much easier than competing in an open market but it erodes our overall standard of living and stifles entrepreneurs by rewarding the politically

ethanol producer he is quoted as saying “the first thing we’ve got to get rid of is business welfare and entitlements” regarding government regulation koch has written that he expects his employees to cooperate fully with the law regardless of personal views we needed to be uncompromising with our workforce to expect  percent of our employees to comply  percent of the time with complex and everchanging government mandates striving to comply with every law does not mean agreeing with every law but even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive we must first comply only then from a credible position can we enter into a dialogue with regulatory agencies to demonstrate alternatives that are more beneficial if these efforts fail we can then join with others in using education andor political efforts to change the law in an april  wall street journal oped koch wrote the fundamental concepts of dignity respect equality before the law and personal freedom are under attack by the nations own government he criticized the obama administration saying that its central belief and fatal conceit is that people are not capable of running their own lives this is the

successfully lobbied for special favors and treatment by seeking mandates for their products subsidies in the form of cash payments from the government and regulations and tariffs to keep more

everchanging government mandates striving to comply with every law does not mean agreeing with every law but even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive we must first comply only then from a credible position can we enter into a dialogue with regulatory agencies to demonstrate alternatives that are more beneficial if these efforts fail we can then join with others in using education andor political efforts to change the law in an april  wall street journal oped koch wrote the fundamental concepts of dignity respect equality before the law and personal freedom are under
