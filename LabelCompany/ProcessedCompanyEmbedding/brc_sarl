for more information see our privacy policy close consumer products helping you consistently produce safe quality and legal products that meet customer requirements overviewthe new issue of the consumer products standards issue  in  has been fully revised to recognise the diversity of products included within consumer products align the standard with the actual buying expectations of specifiers whilst encouraging continuous improvement simplify the requirement and terminology to make it easier to understand widen the scope to include products for wholesale sale and componentsraw materials ensure that requirements were risk based introduce an entry foundation level and higher level to encourage continuous improvement   to achieve these objectives we have divided consumer products into two separate standards global standard for consumer products – general merchandise global standard for consumer products – personal care and household   each of the standards can be certificated at either foundation level or at higher level this enables both flexibility to reflect customer’s needs depending on the product sector and product brand risk and provides a clear pathway for continuous development the standards have been developed by groups of industry experts to ensure they are rigorous and detailed but clearly focused on the key issues to produce safe legal products in accordance with customer quality requirements the standards provide a framework to manage product safety integrity legality and quality and the operational controls for these criteria both standards focus on the importance of management commitment product risk assessments to ensure the products design is safe and legal before production process risk assessment as a tool to ensure that potential issues in the production of the products have been understood prioritized and effectively managed the design and maintenance of the factory and production environment to ensure this is suitable to manufacture and protect products from contamination an effective product testing and sampling process   what’s in the consumer products standards   both the general merchandise and personal care and household standards have the same overall structure and are divided into seven sections    senior management commitment   consistent product safety is the responsibility of everyone within the company however the starting point for an effective product safety plan is the commitment of senior management to the implementation of the standard and continual development this includes providing adequate resources effective communication system reviews actions taken and opportunities for improvement    product risk management   the first step in supplying safe and legal products is to ensure the design or formulation meets legal requirements is safe for the consumer to use and will not fail in the expected life of the product this section looks at understanding legislative requirements and the process of testing products safety and legality and the suitability of intended product packaging before starting to manufacture  product safety and quality management system   this section sets out the requirements for the management of product safety and quality and draws on many of the principles found in iso standards this includes requirements for product specifications supplier approval traceability and the management of incidents and product recalls    site standards   this section sets out expectations for the production environment including the layout and maintenance of the buildings and equipment cleaning pest control and waste management    product inspection and testing   identifies requirements for product testing sampling and maintenance of reference samples    process control   based on the principles of hazard and risk assessment this section looks at how the manufacturing process is managed and controlled to ensure production of consistently safe and legal products to the expected quality this includes contamination controls control of the packing operation and product release    personnel   this section sets out the standards needed for staff training and where applicable protective clothing and personal hygiene why use the brc standard customer confidence the brc global standard will ensure your customers have
