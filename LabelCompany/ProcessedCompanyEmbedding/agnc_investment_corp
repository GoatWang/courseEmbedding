table created entirely by myself partially using data obtained from agncs quarterly investor presentation slides having provided table  above we can now begin to calculate its projected bv as of  this

common and  preferred  common stock prior to projecting agncs common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of  let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter agnc has the following four eventsprograms which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared  public offering of shares “bulk” issuance  atthemarket “atm” offering program  dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase program and  stock repurchase program on  the company priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition agnc granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters option was fully exercised as such i am projecting agnc’s outstanding shares of common stock increased  million shares from its recent public offering of shares even though agnc’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightlytomodestly above its “tangible bv as of   per share i am making the assumption there was no activity within the companys atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  my reasoning is mainly due to the may  equity offering described above when it comes to agnc’s repurchase program this was created in october  and was fairly recently amended in october  to allow the company to repurchase up to  billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through  as of  the company had  billion remaining under its stock repurchase program agnc intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to current tangible bv since the stock price traded modestlytomaterially above the company’s “tangible” bv as of  throughout the second quarter of  i believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock the dividend declared on agncs common stock for the second quarter of  totaled  per share this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the second quarter of  when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the six months ended  now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions  preferred stock the dividend declared on agnc’s “series a preferred stock” agncp and “series b preferred stock” agncb for the second quarter of  was  per share and  per depositary share respectively as such this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter there were still  and  million outstanding shares of agncp and agncb as of  respectively exdividend date when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to agncp and agncb shareholders of  and  million for the second quarter of  respectively when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of  million rounded for the six months ended  after combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of  i am projecting agnc’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated reit taxable

share transactions  increase in net common equity from capital share transactions estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  high  see red reference “d” in table  above next to the june   column as stated earlier on  agnc priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised this calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately  million after accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount i am projecting agnc’s net proceeds from its may  equity offering was approximately  million in addition i am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  also since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of  the following figures should have no activity  issuance of preferred stock and  preferred stock  per share liquidation preference since agnc officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of american capital mortgage management “acmm” last year management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options as such the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts  issuance of restricted stock andor  issuance of common stock under stockbased compensation program however due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock andor stockbased compensation would represent i have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of  any actual amount of restricted stock andor stockbased compensation during the second quarter of  through the issuance of new shares would only have a fractional per share impact on its bv as of  regarding agnc’s “repurchases of common stock” figure as stated earlier i am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of  therefore i am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of  million for the six months ended  see red reference “d” in table  above mtge’s projected bv as of  when compared to agnc i am projecting mtge had a slightly more favorable bv per share fluctuation percentagewise for the second quarter of  each company’s agency mbs and derivatives portfolios as of  had several similarities which were discussed in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the top however it should also be noted mtge had a much larger nonagency mbs portfolio with an attractive cost basis and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing in comparison agnc has a very minor investment in aaa nonagency mbs and no exposure to the healthcare sector when taking all quarterly activities into consideration including additional data not discussed within this specific article i am projecting mtge will report the following bv per common share as of  mtge’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share nly’s bv as of  as was highlighted in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the top of this article i discussed several differences between agnc’s and nly’s investment portfolio furthermore it was discussed each company had a different strategy regarding derivative instruments going into the second quarter of  most notably the difference between each company’s hedging coverage ratio as of  simply put nly’s lower hedging coverage ratio at the start of the second quarter of  was an advantage for the company when compared to agnc in addition it should also be noted management has recently broadened nly’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debtreal estate preferred equity corporate debt and most recently middle market “mm” lending furthermore nly recently acquired a variablerate agency mreit hatteras financial corp nysehts generally speaking these asset classes when compared to fixedrate agency mbs performed similarly during the second quarter of  on  along with nly’s announcement of a july  equity offering the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of  along with several other operating performance metrics it announced an estimated bv as of  of  per common share within the following mbs pricing article dated  i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share when including the quarterly dividend accrual of  per common share which had yet to occur as of  the ex dividend date was  annaly capital and cys investments mbs pricing for q  includes current bv projections due to the negative relationship that existed between most mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share prior to management providing quarterly results several readers privately asked for my projection which i provided as support as such i believe its preliminary estimated bv as of  was basically an exact match to my projected bv nly’s projected bv as of  prior to management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share range  per common share nly’s estimated bv as of  per management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share conclusions drawn to sum up all the information discussed above i am projecting agnc will report the following bv per common share as of  agnc’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share this projection is a  per common share decrease from its bv as of  this minor decrease can be attributed to two factors the first factor is in relation to the activity within the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income i am projecting agnc will report a net loss of  million for the second quarter of  while reporting oci of  million when both figures are combined i am projecting agnc will report comprehensive income of  million for the second quarter of  the second factor is in relation to the activity within agnc’s equity section of the balance sheet the company paid foraccrued dividend distributions totaling  per common share during the second quarter of  in addition it paid foraccrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the companys outstanding shares of preferred stock furthermore agncs may  equity offering resulted in some minor dilution when combined these two factors account for a projected quarterly bv decrease of  per common share when calculated i am projecting agnc’s bv per common share had a decrease of  during the second quarter of  i am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” dividends paidaccrued for and net change in bv of  for the second quarter of  similar to the prior quarter there was a more “neutralmuted” relationship between mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of  “option adjusted spreads” or oas as such i believe most mreit peers will report only a minor less than  fluctuation in quarterly bv with that being said i believe most mreit stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutralmuted relationship when it comes to sector valuations i believe four key factors to analyze within the fixedrate agency mreit sector this quarter are the following  each company’s proportion of year mbs holdings versus year mbs holdings  each company’s hedging coverage ratio  each company’s proportion of longterm derivative instruments versus shortterm derivative instruments and  each company’s proportion of specified pools for instance harp and llb securities dependent upon these factors i believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixedrate agency mreit sector for the second quarter of  looking ahead to the third quarter of  mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course through  the fixedpay rate on interest rate swaps and us treasury yields have also seen the same trend through  when compared to   however the forward libor curve has remained relatively unchanged in addition it should be noted the relationship between agency mbs pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of july minor tightening of spreads through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article i am projecting agnc’s bv as of  has fluctuated between  and  per common share when compared to the company’s bv as of  this projection excludes the july  monthly dividend of  per common share exdividend is  my buy sell or hold recommendation from the analysis provided above including additional catalystsfactors not discussed within this particular article i currently rate agnc as a sell when i believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  a hold when trading at or greater than a  but less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  and a buy when trading at or greater than a  discount to my projected bv as of  these ranges are unchanged when compared to part  of my income statement projection article approximately three weeks ago therefore i currently rate agnc as a sell however fairly close to my hold range since the stock is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  my current price target for agnc is approximately  per share this is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a hold the current price where my recommendation would change to a buy is approximately  per share along with the data presented within this article this recommendation considers the following mreit catalystsfactors  projected future mbs price movements  projected future derivative valuations and  projected nearterm dividend per share rates this recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple federal “fed” funds rate increases by the fomc during  this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year due to recent macroeconomic trendsevents this also considers the eventual “winddown” of the fed’s balance sheet final note each investors buy sell or hold decision is based on ones risk tolerance time horizon and dividend income goals my personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy the factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to

monthsended time frame using table  below as a reference one must add certain account figures from the first and second quarters of  for purposes of projecting a suitable bv as of  table   agnc three monthsended consolidated statements of comprehensive income source table created entirely by myself partially using data obtained from agncs quarterly investor presentation slides having provided table  above we can now begin to calculate its projected bv as of  this projection will be calculated in table  below there will not be an identical sheet agnc provides that matches the data within table  i have gathered specific information derived from multiple tablescharts for a more detailed analysis of the companys bv as of  agnc through its quarterly investor presentation slides see link above only provides the public with a “book value roll forward” slide this specific slide uses information based only on a quarterly time frame i perform a more detailed quarterly bv calculationanalysis based on the entire year table   agnc three monthsended bv projection bv as of  source table created entirely by myself including all calculated figures and projected valuations using table  above as a reference let us take a look at the calculation for agncs projected bv as of  unless otherwise noted all figures below are for the “six months ended” time frame let us take a look at the following figures in corresponding order to the “ref” column shown in table  next to the june   column a operations b other comprehensive income loss ociocl c stockholder transactions and d capital share transactions a operations  increase in net common equity from operations estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  moderate to high  see red reference “a” in table  above next to the june   column this “net increase decrease in net common equity from operations figure consists of the following amounts that come directly from the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income see tables  and  above  net interest income  total other income loss  total expenses and  excise tax due to the fact i discussed these amounts in my previous threepart agnc consolidated statement of comprehensive income projection article see links near the top further discussion of this figure is redundantunwarranted b other comprehensive income loss ociocl  increase in net common equity from other comprehensive income oci estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  moderate to high  see red reference “b” in table  above next to the june   column

and  above  unrealized gain loss on availableforsale “afs” securities net and  unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments net upon reclassification to interest expense due to the fact i also discussed these accounts in my previous threepart agnc consolidated statement of comprehensive income article see links near the top further discussion of this figure is redundantunwarranted as well c stockholder transactions  decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  high  see red reference “c” in table  above next to the june   column this “net increase decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions” figure is agncs dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of  this figure includes activity in relation to the following types of outstanding shares of stock  common and  preferred  common stock prior to projecting agncs common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of  let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter agnc has the following four eventsprograms which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared  public offering of shares “bulk” issuance  atthemarket “atm” offering program  dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase program and  stock repurchase program on  the company priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition agnc granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters option was fully exercised as such i am projecting agnc’s outstanding shares of common stock increased  million shares from its recent public offering of shares even though agnc’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightlytomodestly above its “tangible bv as of   per share i am making the assumption there was no activity within the companys atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  my reasoning is mainly due to the may  equity offering described above when it comes to agnc’s repurchase program this was created in october  and was fairly recently amended in october  to allow the company to repurchase up to  billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through  as of  the company had  billion remaining under its stock repurchase program agnc intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to current tangible bv since the stock price traded modestlytomaterially above the company’s “tangible” bv as of  throughout the second quarter of  i believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock the dividend declared on agncs common stock for the second quarter of  totaled  per share this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the second quarter of  when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the six months ended  now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions  preferred stock the dividend declared on agnc’s “series a preferred stock” agncp and “series b preferred stock” agncb for the second quarter of  was  per share and  per depositary share respectively as such this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter there were still  and  million outstanding shares of agncp and agncb as of  respectively exdividend date when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to agncp and agncb shareholders of  and  million for the second quarter of  respectively when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of  million rounded for the six months ended  after combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of  i am projecting agnc’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated reit taxable incomeundistributed taxable income “uti”” and decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions was  million rounded for the six months ended  see red reference “c” in table  above d capital share transactions  increase in net common equity from capital share transactions estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  high  see red reference “d” in table  above next to the june   column as stated earlier on  agnc priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised this calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately  million after accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount i am projecting agnc’s net proceeds from its may  equity offering was approximately  million in addition i am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  also since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of  the following figures should have no activity  issuance of preferred stock and  preferred stock  per share liquidation preference since agnc officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of american capital mortgage management “acmm” last year management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options as such the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts  issuance of restricted stock andor  issuance of common stock under stockbased compensation program however due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock andor stockbased compensation would represent i have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of  any actual amount of restricted stock andor stockbased compensation during the second quarter of  through the issuance of new shares would only have a fractional per share impact on its bv as of  regarding agnc’s “repurchases of common stock” figure as stated earlier i am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of  therefore i am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of  million for the six months ended  see red reference “d” in table  above mtge’s projected bv as of  when compared to agnc i am projecting mtge had a slightly more favorable bv per share fluctuation percentagewise for the second quarter of  each company’s agency mbs and derivatives portfolios as of  had several similarities which were discussed in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the top however it should also be noted mtge had a much larger nonagency mbs portfolio with an attractive cost basis and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing in comparison agnc has a very minor investment in aaa nonagency mbs and no exposure to the healthcare sector when taking all quarterly activities into consideration including additional data not discussed within this specific article i am projecting mtge will report the following bv per common share as of  mtge’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share nly’s bv as of  as was highlighted in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the

speaking these asset classes when compared to fixedrate agency mbs performed similarly during the second quarter of  on  along with nly’s announcement of a july  equity offering the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of  along with several other operating performance metrics it announced an estimated bv as of  of  per common share within the following mbs pricing article dated  i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share when including the quarterly dividend accrual of  per common share which had yet to occur as of  the ex dividend date was  annaly capital and cys investments mbs pricing for q  includes current bv projections due to the negative relationship that existed between most mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share prior to management providing quarterly results several readers privately asked for my projection which i provided as support as such i believe its preliminary estimated bv as of  was basically an exact match to my projected bv nly’s projected bv as of  prior to management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share range  per common share nly’s estimated bv as of  per management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share conclusions drawn to sum up all the information discussed above i am projecting agnc will report the following bv per common share as of  agnc’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share this projection is a  per common share decrease from its bv as of  this minor decrease can be attributed to two factors the first factor is in relation to the activity within the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income i am projecting agnc will report a net loss of  million for the second quarter of  while reporting oci of  million when both figures are combined i am projecting agnc will report comprehensive income of  million for the second quarter of  the second factor is in relation to the activity within agnc’s equity section of the balance sheet the company paid foraccrued dividend distributions totaling  per common share during the second quarter of  in addition it paid foraccrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the companys outstanding shares of preferred stock furthermore agncs may  equity offering resulted in some minor dilution when combined these two factors account for a projected quarterly bv decrease of  per common share when calculated i am projecting agnc’s bv per common share had a decrease of  during the second quarter of  i am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” dividends paidaccrued for and net change in bv of  for the second quarter of  similar to the prior quarter there was a more “neutralmuted” relationship between mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of  “option adjusted spreads” or oas as such i believe most mreit peers will report only a minor less than  fluctuation in quarterly bv with that being said i believe most mreit stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutralmuted relationship when it comes to sector valuations i believe four key factors to analyze within the fixedrate agency mreit sector this quarter are the following  each company’s proportion of year mbs holdings versus year mbs holdings  each company’s hedging coverage ratio  each company’s proportion of longterm derivative instruments versus shortterm derivative instruments and  each company’s proportion of specified pools for instance harp and llb securities dependent upon these factors i believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixedrate agency mreit sector for the second quarter of  looking ahead to the third quarter of  mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course through  the fixedpay rate on interest rate swaps and us treasury yields have also seen the same trend through  when compared to   however the forward libor curve has remained relatively unchanged in addition it should be noted the relationship between agency mbs pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of july minor tightening of spreads through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article i am projecting agnc’s bv as of  has fluctuated between  and  per common share when compared to the company’s bv as of  this projection excludes the july  monthly dividend of  per common share exdividend is  my buy sell or hold recommendation from the analysis provided above including additional catalystsfactors not discussed within this particular article i currently rate agnc as a sell when i believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  a hold when trading at or greater than a  but less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  and a buy when trading at or greater than a  discount to my projected bv as of  these ranges are unchanged when compared to part  of my income statement projection article approximately three weeks ago therefore i currently rate agnc as a sell however fairly close to my hold range since the stock is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  my current price target for agnc is approximately  per share this is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a hold the current price where my recommendation would change to a buy is approximately  per share along

consideration since this account is the summation of the quarterly unrealized valuation changes within agnc’s mbs portfolio by far the largest asset class on the company’s balance sheet a wider projection range should be accompanied with this specific account the same assumptions used within agnc’s gain loss on sale of agency securities net account see part  of article and gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities net account regarding the company’s tba mbs position see part  of article will be applied when discussing this account prior to performing an account projection analysis let us first analyze the fixedrate agency mbs price movements during the second quarter of  using table  below as a reference let us first analyze the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements this will then be followed by a similar analysis via table  of the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements by doing so this will help readers understand how i come up with my projected valuations discussed later in the article table  – year fixedrate agency mbs price movements q  source table created entirely by myself using mbs pricing data via private access to a

above from the information provided in table  a valuation gain loss can be calculated which is broken down by the various coupons it should also be noted agnc continually changes the company’s mbs portfolio in any given quarter as such i must determine specific purchase and sale assumptions towards the end of my account projection analysis using table  above as a reference let us look at the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements regarding coupon rates where agnc held a material balance as of  the cumulative quarterly net mbs price movements for each coupon rate are shown within table  under the “cumulative quarterly change” column for example during the second quarter of  a fannie year fixedrate agency mbs with a    and  coupon had a cumulative quarterly price increase decrease of    and  to settle its price at    and  respectively as such a modest price increase occurred on the  coupon while a minor price fluctuation occurred on the   and  coupons when compared to fannie year fixedrate agency mbs freddie year fixedrate agency with a   and  coupon had slight differences or no difference in cumulative net price valuations however there was a more notable difference when it came to the  coupon now that we have an understanding of the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements during the second quarter of  let us take a look at the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements table  – year fixedrate agency mbs price movements q  source table created entirely by myself using mbs pricing data via private access to a professional resource thomson reuters link provided below table  table  above shows the year fixedrate agency mbs price movements during the second quarter of  it breaks out these mbs holdings by gse as well as stated earlier agnc’s ginnie mae fixedrate

fannie year fixedrate agency mbs freddie year fixedrate agency mbs with similar coupons had slight differences in cumulative net price fluctuations now that we have an understanding of the  and year fixedrate agency mbs price movements during the second quarter of  let us take a look at how i believe these price movements impacted agnc’s mbs portfolio i am projecting an “initial” net valuation gain of  million regarding agnc’s  and year fixedrate agency mbs holdings for the second quarter of  however as stated earlier several other adjustments need to be performed within agnc’s unrealized gain loss on afs securities net account before a final projection can be made since agnc had a portion of the company’s fixedrate agency mbs holdings within “specified pools” prepayment protected mbs mainly through the home affordable refinance program harp and lowloan balance llb securities a quarterly valuation adjustment needs to be calculated through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article datasupport in relation to agnc’s specified pools is beyond a “free to the public” article i am projecting agnc had an additional net valuation gain of  million for the second quarter of  in regards to the company’s specified pools when these two figures are combined i am projecting agnc had a net valuation gain of  on the company’s  and year fixedrate agency mbs portfolio in addition through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article i am projecting agnc had a net valuation gain of  million during the second quarter of  in regards to the following mbs holdings  year fixedrate  collateralized mortgage obligations “cmo”  adjustablerate mortgages “arm”  credit risk transfers “crt” and  aaa nonagency also when considering the impacts of an assumed partial conversion of agnc’s net long tba mbs position and the company’s realignment of its mbs portfolio throughout the quarter i am projecting a net valuation loss adjustment of  million for the second quarter of  therefore when all the figures stated above are combined i am projecting a total net valuation gain of  million on agnc’s mbs portfolio for the second quarter of  this figure is prior to all sold mbs being reversed out in the current quarter discussed in part  of the article and the reclassification of all unrealized gains losses regarding mbs purchased after  these two reversals are shown in table  below table  agnc quarterly unrealized gain loss on afs securities net projection source table created entirely by myself partially using agnc data obtained from the sec’s edgar database table  above shows agnc’s projected total net valuation gain of  million on the company’s mbs portfolio see red reference “ab” in table  above this amount is highlighted in teal the second amount shown is agnc’s projected “reversal of prior period unrealized “gain” loss net upon realization” figure see red reference “ac” in table  above this amount is highlighted in pink the third amount shown is agnc’s projected “reversal of unrealized “gain” loss on investment securities measured at fmv through net income net” figure see red reference “ad” in table  above this amount is highlighted in dark teal therefore after agnc’s projected net realized loss on the sale of agency securities of  million and net unrealized gain on investment securities measured at fmv through net income of  million is reversed out the company’s total net unrealized gain on afs securities is projected to be  million for the second quarter of  see red reference “ab  ac  ad  ae” in table  above this amount is highlighted in grey brief discussion of mtge’s and nly’s unrealized gain loss on agency securities net account i see general similarities between agnc and the company’s affiliate mtge regarding agency mbs portfolio strategies as such i see a fairly similar projection between agnc’s unrealized gain loss on afs securities net account and mtge’s “unrealized gain loss on agency securities net” account for the second quarter of  proportionally speaking with that being said when compared to agnc mtge had a slightly higher proportional share of year fixedrate agency mbs holdings as of  which needs to be considered regarding projected valuations furthermore one should consider that agnc likely “deployed” at least some of the company’s newly raised capital from its may  equity offering during the quarter in addition mtge also had a much larger nonagency mbs portfolio proportionately speaking due to this fact mtge also has an “unrealized gain loss on nonagency securities net” account that needs to be incorporated into the company’s financials mtges nonagency mbs portfolio has different valuation methods which are mainly based on specific indexes and simulated models which are classified as level  assets per accounting standards codification “asc”  this includes but is not limited to prime crt alta option arm and subprime holdings mtge’s nonagency mbs portfolio had a conditional prepayment rate “cpr” of  a conditional default rate “cdr” of  and a voluntary prepayment rate “vpr” of  as of  i anticipate a relatively flatminor increase to these three metrics during the second quarter of  which would slightly impact valuations further discussion of mtge’s nonagency mbs portfolio is beyond the scope of this article when it comes to agnc’s sector peer nly i see one modest difference that would impact the account described above as of  only  of nly’s fixedrate agency mbs portfolio consisted of year maturities whereas agnc had  of the company’s mbs portfolio in year maturities excluding tba mbs positions since most year fixedrate agency mbs coupons had additional price increases when compared to year fixedrate agency mbs with similar coupons nly should have a slightly higher combined total net valuation gain on afs securities realized and unrealized when compared to agnc during the second quarter of  proportionally speaking in addition it should also be noted management has recently broadened nly’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debtreal estate preferred equity corporate debt and most recently middle market “mm” lending furthermore nly recently acquired a variablerate agency mreit hatteras financial corp hts generally speaking most of these asset classes when compared to fixedrate agency mbs also experienced relatively flatminor price increases during the second quarter of  a further discussion of nly’s mbsinvestment portfolio is beyond the scope of this article b other comprehensive income loss ociocl  estimate of  million range – million  confidence within range  moderate to high  see red reference “b” in table  below next to the june   column let us now take a look at agncs projected ociocl and comprehensive income loss amounts this information is provided in table  below table  – agnc quarterly ociocl and comprehensive income loss projection source table created entirely by myself partially using data obtained from agncs quarterly investor presentation slides after combining the company’s net unrealized gain on afs securities of  million and its net unrealized gain on interest rate swaps upon reclassification of  i am projecting agnc will report oci of  million for the second quarter of  see red reference “b” in table

loss of  million see part  and part  and b oci of  million see analysis above therefore when these two amounts are combined i am projecting agnc will report comprehensive income of  million for the second quarter of  conclusions drawn from part  part  and part  to sum up the analysis from all three parts of the article i am projecting agnc will report the following amounts for the second quarter of  a quarterly net loss of  million earnings available to common shareholders of  per share b quarterly oci of  million c quarterly comprehensive income a and b combined of  million comprehensive income available to common shareholders of  per share agnc’s projected net loss of  million for the second quarter of  is a minor decrease when compared to net income of  million for the first quarter of  this is mainly due to agnc’s projected net valuation loss of  million regarding the company’s derivatives portfolio for the second quarter of  for the same account in the prior quarter agnc recognized a net valuation loss of only  million i am also projecting agnc will report oci of  million for the second quarter of  this projected amount is a very minor increase when compared to oci of  million for the first quarter of  i believe agnc will slightly underperform the fixedrate agency mreit peer average in regards to valuation fluctuations for the second quarter of  this is mainly due to agnc’s higher hedging coverage ratio and the composition of the company’s mbs portfolio heading into the second quarter of  when compared to its fixedrate agency mreit peers i believe four key factors to analyze within the fixedrate agency mreit sector this quarter are the following  each company’s proportion of year mbs holdings versus year mbs holdings  each company’s hedging coverage ratio  each company’s proportion of longterm derivative instruments versus shortterm derivative instruments and  each company’s proportion of specified pools for instance harp and llb securities dependent upon these factors i believe results will modestly vary across the fixedrate agency mreit sector for the second quarter of  my buy sell or hold recommendation for my agnc buy sell or hold recommendation please see part  of this article link provided at the beginning of the article final note the projected amounts from this threepart article will have a direct impact on agnc’s projected

high  see red reference “c” in table  above next to the june   column finally let us look at agnc’s comprehensive income for the second quarter of  this is the summation of the following amounts a net loss of  million see part  and part  and b oci of  million see analysis above therefore when these two amounts are combined i am projecting agnc will report comprehensive income of  million for the second quarter of  conclusions drawn from part  part  and part  to sum up the analysis from all three parts of the article i am projecting agnc will report the following amounts for the second quarter of  a quarterly net loss of  million earnings available to common shareholders of  per share b quarterly oci of  million c quarterly comprehensive income a and b combined of  million comprehensive income available to common shareholders of  per share agnc’s projected net loss of  million for the second quarter of  is a minor decrease when compared to net income of  million for the first quarter of  this is mainly due to agnc’s projected net valuation loss of  million regarding the company’s derivatives portfolio for the second quarter of  for the same account in the prior quarter agnc recognized a net valuation loss of only  million i am also projecting agnc will report oci of  million for the second quarter of  this projected amount is a very minor increase when compared to oci of  million for the first quarter of  i believe agnc will slightly underperform the fixedrate agency mreit peer average in regards to valuation fluctuations for the second quarter of  this is mainly due to agnc’s higher hedging coverage ratio and the composition of the company’s mbs portfolio heading into the second quarter of  when compared to its fixedrate agency mreit peers i believe four key factors to analyze within the fixedrate agency mreit sector this quarter are the following  each company’s proportion of year mbs holdings versus year mbs holdings  each company’s hedging coverage ratio  each company’s proportion of longterm derivative instruments versus shortterm derivative instruments and  each company’s proportion of specified pools for instance harp and llb securities dependent upon these factors i believe results will modestly vary across the fixedrate agency mreit sector for the second quarter of  my buy sell or hold recommendation for my agnc buy sell or hold recommendation please see part  of this article link provided at the beginning of the article final note the projected amounts from this threepart article will have a direct impact on agnc’s projected book value “bv” as of  my upcoming agnc bv projection article will be available to readers prior to the company’s earnings press release for the second quarter of  on  each investors buy sell or hold

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business
