building in berne the snb provides a gold custody service for other central banks gold storage customers of the snb include the bank of italy the swedish riksbank the bank of finland and the bank for international settlements gold ownership under switzerland’s national gold reserve policy the swiss national bank snb holds and manages switzerland’s gold reserves this policy is derived from the swiss federal constitution which grants the snb its independence and mandate article  of the constitution requires that the snb hold sufficient currency reserves  foreign exchange reserves part of which must be in the form of gold snb gold storage in april  the snb for the first time clarified the storage locations and locational distribution of switzerland’s gold reserves revealing that approximately  of swiss gold reserves are stored in switzerland  at the bank of england in london and  with the bank of canada in ottawa until that time the snb had never revealed the storage locations of the country’s gold citing security reasons the snb’s  gold storage policy announcement was strategic in nature that it was primarily an attempt to deflect criticism levelled by the promoters of the swiss gold initiative see below about the snb’s lack of transparency on its gold activities the snb also claimed in its april  announcement that it had been exclusively storing its gold in switzerland the uk and canada “for over  years” in october  the snb revealed that it had previously stored gold at the federal reserve bank of new york but that this gold had been completely sold as part of the swiss gold sales see below “stocks that were once the us federal reserve fed have been sold” swiss gold initiative the swiss gold initiative or ‘save our swiss gold’ campaign was a federal popular initiative launched by members of the swiss people’s party svp in  with the intention of altering the swiss federal constitution the “gold initiative” full name “a swiss initiative to secure the swiss national bank’s gold reserves” culminated with a referendum on  november  which asked the swiss population to vote on three proposals concerning switzerland’s national gold reserves the gold of the swiss national bank must be stored physically in switzerland the swiss national bank does not have the right to sell its gold reserves the swiss national bank must hold at least twenty percent  of its total assets in gold although the referendum was not successful and did not get the required majority of votes on the day it did force the swiss national bank to divulge a lot more information about the swiss gold reserves than it ever otherwise would have revealed and also showed up the snb to be inconsistent in its continual excuses for opposing the referendum motions gold sales  –  prior to  switzerland held  tonnes of gold making the country the world’s th largest official gold holders however between  and  and again between  and  the snb sold off a combined  tonnes of its gold reserves these gold sales programs were preplanned in the s by the snb and elements within the swiss government even though the central bank at that time did not have authorisation to sell any gold however through a series of manoeuvres this ‘sell gold’ contingent within the swiss central bank and finance ministry axis succeeded in convincing the swiss government and people to selfdetonate their nation’s store of wealth firstly in  the constitutional requirement for the swiss franc to be  backed by gold was lowered to a  backing subsequently in  an ‘expert group’ made up of the snb and staff from the swiss federal administration recommended that switzerland should sell  tonnes of gold arguing that with a reduced  gold backing requirement switzerland would otherwise end up holding surplus gold in april  further constitutional amendments were put to the swiss electorate which proposed dropping the  gold backing for the currency and severing the link between the swiss franc and gold these amendments passed after which the swiss national bank proceeded to sell  tonnes of gold between  and  all sales of which fell under the first and second central bank gold agreements which coordinated gold sales among european central banks between may and september  the snb sold  tonnes of gold over the subsequent  months from october  to september  the snb sold another  tonnes the first  tonnes of these sales were executed by the bank for international settlements on behalf of the snb the snb then directly executed gold sales itself from october  selling  tonnes over four years until september  of the  tonne total sold between  and   tonnes settled using gold at the bank of england between  and  the snb sold an additional  tonnes of its remaining gold claiming that it needed to rebalance its reserves between foreign currencies and gold the combined gold sales from  to  totalled  tonnes and reduced switzerland’s gold holdings from  tonnes to  tonnes swiss national bank gold vault – berne while the snb has confirmed that approximately  of its gold is held in switzerland it has not divulged the exact storage location however the snb maintains its own gold vaults under its headquarters on the bundesplatz in berne and swiss media believe that the swiss gold is most likely stored there the snb’s gold vaults in berne have also been captured in published photographs for example as per the following shots   swiss national bank as gold custodian a number of other central banks and official monetary institutions such as the bank for international settlements bis are on record as storing some of their gold reserves with the snb in berne this also confirms the existence and location of the snb’s gold vaults therefore the snb does not just store its own gold it stores gold on behalf of fellow central banks the bis does not have its own gold vaults in switzerland or anywhere else however the bis offers gold custody facilities term gold deposit facilities and spot and forward purchase and sale gold transactions with settlement ‘loco london’ loco new york and ‘loco berne’ for ‘loco berne’ the bis uses the snb’s gold vaults the banca d’italia revealed in  that it holds a small percentage of its gold with the swiss national bank through a bis account arrangement the swedish riksbank announced in october  that it holds  tonnes of gold or  of its overall gold reserves with the swiss national bank the bank of finland also announced in october  that it holds  tonnes  of its gold reserves in the custody of the snb the swiss national bank snb also facilitates gold lending operations for its central bank customers and therefore indirectly it provides gold custody services to commercial banks in the context of gold lending operations however the snb does not offer commercial banks gold storage services beyond transactions linked to gold lending gold lending operations of the snb  the snb claims to have not undertaken any lending of its own gold since  in  the snb confirmed to bullionstar that “since  there are no outstanding claims from gold lending in the snb’s balance sheet” the snb  annual report states that “in managing its investment portfolio the snb lends part of its gold holdings to firstclass domestic and foreign financial institutions it receives interest in return gold lending transactions are effected on a secured basis the gold price risk remains with the snb gold loans are entered in the balance sheet under claims from gold transactions and stated at market value inclusive of accrued interest the valuation result and interest are stated under net result from gold” the snb’s  balance sheet shows an amount of  tonnes under line item ‘claims from gold transactions’ and nil under the same line item for yearend  when the snb did engage in gold lending in the s its gold lending program was manged by then snb senior manager michael  paprotta was also responsible for the snb’s gold sales program valuation and reporting like its major neighbour central banks in france germany and italy the switzerland central bank holds substantial gold reserves however unlike the french german and italian central banks the snb’s gold reserves make up a very small percentage of its total foreign reserve assets this is because the snb rapidly expanded its balance sheet between  and  due to pursuing a monetary policy goal of maintaining a target exchange rate between the swiss franc and the euro of  which necessitated the purchase of huge amounts of foreign currency which produced the bloated balance sheet the snb holds its gold reserves as an asset on its balance sheet in the form of monetary gold which is classified as line item “gold holdings” and is valued at financial yearend at a market price in chf swiss francs per kilogram form of gold holdings the snb states in its annual reports that its “gold holdings consist of gold ingots and gold coins” in another snb publications titled ‘the swiss national bank in brief’ the snb states that its “gold holdings are mainly in the form of gold bars with the remainder in gold coins” however in response to a bullionstar question about the types of gold coins held by the snb the swiss central bank responded that it “does not publish details regarding gold bars and gold coins” this again shows the secrecy and lack of transparency with which the snb actually acts in matters related to its gold holdings and gold activities references and links  official central bank
