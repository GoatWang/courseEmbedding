involvement of its engineers is what the dominant software company is looking for fred ebrahimi president and ceo quark tells roopinder singh quark has dominated the publishing software market for long founded in  in denver colorado usa the company set up a software development centre in india in november  farhad f fred ebrahimi president and ceo quark incorporated has a slightly rumpled and casual look that bespeaks more of an academic rather a businessman he was in chandigarh recently and the following are excerpts from an exclusive interview how did quark manage to get the massive market share that it has of the publishing world was it the typographical precision because we have the best product quark has  per cent of the share in publishing and that’s reasonable laugh reliability ease of use and a very strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed and the extensions i have people coming to me and saying that when they use the competitor’s products they spend double the time and time is quite valuable i think that it is because we have spent tremendous amount of time and energy trying to understand what makes a customer happy when he uses it you are correct also that we have tremendous precision we supported very strong typographical features way earlier than anybody else it is not just the features it feels better how did you all come up with the idea of having something like quark the company was started by a partner of mine tim gill see box who is no longer a shareholder he came from the computer side and i came from the computer and publishing background when we got involved both of us wanted to democratise publishing in those days because of the expensive cost of prepress processes very few people could publish it took millions of dollars to start a publication we thought that it would be a good contribution to the world if we provided tools so that people with modest means could publish so we used our skills as engineers and when we shipped quarkxpress  there were only eight of us five were engineers and the rest administrative accounting staff etc it took us nine months to ship quarkxpress  it was a labour of love what is quark software engineer tim gill founded quark in  producing the first word processor for the apple ii computer gill named the company quark after the subatomic particle proposed as a building block for all matter fred ebrahimi quark’s president and ceo came on board in  a year later the company released quarkxpress  sparking a publishing revolution during the next few years quark focused on perfecting the features such as typography hyphenation multilanguage capabilities and professional output features that have made quarkxpress the most popular publishing software among designers publishers and printers around the world by the early s quarkxpress had solidified its position as the industry leader in the electronic publishing market when did you start we started in june and we shipped in march  by that time you had other products for desktop publishing not desktop publishing but word processing we had a product called word juggler for apple ii page maker was however there yes page maker had an extensive market share there were  other products including ready set go it’s not that we didn’t have any competition you did well till quarkxpress  which did not quite turn out to be as it was expected we made a mistake with quark  i have apologised publicly we didn’t test it enough we had great new features what we didn’t do is test it as strongly as we should have and quark  subsequently solved those problems and we have made a commitment that quark  will not ship till our customers say “ship” what is the direction that  will be going in well the most significant issue of  is we are producing a tool that would enable you to go to print and with the same person and same resources be able to create a web page with it conveniently the html output from  is very powerful from which you could produce for example ebooks in microsoft reader flash or svg there is one thing that is very important to understand about this strategy—we all know that publishers are losing money on the web there is no substantial revenue there but they have to do it anyway they have to have a web site they can’t say “i don’t have a web site” and right now they have all the additional cost without the revenue to compensate so it is a losing proposition we think that we are making a major contribution there you could do what you make money at — namely print publications and at the same time put things on the web without an additional cost that’s the strategy obviously we have added many features like tables layers but those are not as important as this fundamental issue so in effect quark is moving from print publishing to conversion you are absolutely correct and in this you are supporting the industry standard in html compatible with the world wide web consortium w absolutely actually the vehicle we use is xml quark is a senior member of w and we use very clean standard html output none of the crazy derivatives that you have problems with later on in fact you could take the html that we produce and take it to a product like dreamweaver and additionally modify it if you wish our commitment first is to our installed base they are the ones who have stuck with us good or bad they have paid us they have given us great ideas and criticised us we love publishing and we are not going to abandon it as other companies are doing we are committed to publishing i have it in my blood i love publishing and a lot of our staff is from publishing background and we are doing everything we can to help publishing what are the other quark products a very good example is quark digital media system or dms and quite a bit of work on it is being done in this very building chandigarh the same is the case with quarkxpress  the whole thing about dms is the ability to store the content and deploy it whether for print or internet or whatever you want it for it seamlessly integrates with quarkxpress to allow you to easily reuse individual elements from quarkxpress pages in a variety of publications we have to admit that we are pleasantly surprised that not only the publishing industry likes it like the independent newspaper in south africa but we also have customers like mail order catalogue firms banks and financial institutions like barclay using it it is a very powerful product for us and it is generating very good revenue it has a very tight integration with quarkxpress though we also support other programs like photoshop and microsoft word quark wrapture is for very sophisticated packaging design you can look at it three dimensionally and so on we have not tried to market it in india but basically in the usa and japan most of the work on mirim data analysis and decision support tools for examining historical and realtime sales data from the internet and print promotions is being done here in chandigarh it is about seeing how effective a marketing campaign is because a lot of times people spend tremendous amount of money in marketing and retail campaigns for certain merchandise but don’t know how effective it is who buys it why he buys it and so on mirim combines date from existing order management systems digital images from catalogues and web pages and data from ecommerce systems resulting in a single solution for direct marketing professionals why did you come to india in the first place what has your indian experience been like i am an explorer being an iranian this is like a second home to me i feel comfortable my wife loved it my children love it there is an affinity i have to admit that from a business point of view it wasn’t a number one priority at first it was a personal issue and we have enjoyed it here there are difficulties i don’t want to in any form or shape disregard those but it is worth it what is it that makes it worth it in a very modest way we feel that we have made a difference here that means a lot to me what exactly is the kind of work that you are doing here this is what makes us significantly different from other companies we do truly original work we treat our engineers exactly the same way as we do in the usa and they are treated exactly the same way as they would be in the usa or germany and get the same respect as they would in the usa we have people here who are working on quarkxpress  which is obviously very important to us it is a  millionayear revenue product they are working on dms on mirim we are doing something that not too many companies are trying to do most other it activities are contract work here year yk and so on and that’s not the most interesting work it’s one time you do the work and it’s for a third party which you don’t even know what we are developing is a product that many companies use so you get a different kind of satisfaction out of that has the economic slowdown in the usa affected quark yes if any company says that the economic slowdown hasn’t affected it it’s lying have you laid off anybody no no way we are actually in a hiring mode first of all we predicted this slowdown when everyone else was hiring we cancelled projects in some cases we ended up with a lower level of staff in the usa which was a part of our strategy we were very well prepared we are also very liquid we have zero debt we are lenders to banks not borrowers from banks we have a very strong economic situation so we can take advantage of this slowdown and expand we are in the expansion mode all over the world especially in india however let me be very honest with you what we are doing is that we are raising the bar of expectation don’t be surprised if you hear that i have let someone go nonproductive engineers are everywhere even in this building we weren’t right with every engineer that we hired but please don’t misunderstand and think that we are lowering the staff we are going to hire over  engineers in chandigarh as soon as we find ones who are good whether it takes two months or two years what we are not going to do is just fill the position regardless of the qualifications we are going to be much more demanding so quark will be a hard place to get in during the bubble time a lot of expectation was built a lot of people were given positions that they should not have been given in every company including quark and corrections are needed we are lucky in that we are prepared for this and we can go up but a lot of companies have to cut we are not cutting a single position because of lack of money if we do any cutting it is because the person is not qualified what kind of skills is quark looking for there is something more important than skill you are talking to me at a very special moment i think that before skill we have come to the conclusion we want to look for a certain character a lot of people were inducted in the it business worldwide including india but they don’t have the intellectual capacity and emotional commitment to be in the software business people shouldn’t become software developers unless they really love this and they have a tremendous caring frankly i compare it to good journalism a great journalist loves what he does he doesn’t do it for the money or for any other reason than searching for the truth in software you want to please the customer what you should be doing is developing absolutely the best you can for the customer that orientation is not strong outside the usa even in the usa it’s not all that common though there is a little better understanding of how to find out what the customer wants in india or germany they are accustomed to somebody giving the specifications because they have done contract work and then preparing the coding according to the specifications they have a rigid process it is not interactive it is not creative so a lot of people in india are not trying to work in such an interactive flexible way in fact they have been trying to be rigid so we want a person who is creative is open to new ideas and is also a good engineer but believe me being a good engineer is secondary somebody who pushes the bubble just that little bit extra when needed and cares in fact i am very seriously considering hiring nonengineers to do it work because they bring a human side look i am an engineer and i feel comfortable criticising my own kind we are not trained to have a sense of history of art of humanity and so on very few of us read poetry we deal with formulas and questions we see the world differently we need those skills but they are not hard to come by we need to be human first you are well known for your attempts to help disadvantaged children i think that it’s important to have education available to disadvantaged children i don’t want them to learn about technology alone because i think that it’s even more important that they learn about humanity so a blend of technological education and humanities is needed so i am more than happy to do what i can reasonably do to help what are the projects that you are working on in chandigarh we have started with a programme for scholarships as an experiment forty scholarships i believe and they have chosen the candidates we want to run it as an experiment and if it is successful i want to expand it a large number of children are doing it courses in india what kinds of skill sets have a future what languages have a future this is another problem in india not just in this country but more severely here i think that the language etc are not important but the image here is that someone heard that his or her friend is a java programmer and is earning double the salary therefore they study java they have no understanding of java they have no love of that the language used to develop the software is number five in our list of priorities engineers again think that’s that most important issue that’s not true actually we have some serious questions about java java applications have not been as efficient the fact of the matter is that i don’t know of a single real successful java application that has sold a lot i am not saying that there is anything wrong with java we are using java as are millions of companies but in some areas it is very appropriate to use c because it is much more efficient to some young kids and pundits it becomes a religion and it’s “my religion is better than your religion” which is nonsense which is garbage you should use the right tool for doing the work and sometimes it is java or c or at times c one thing is emerging as very important that we fully support in quarkxpress  is xml you have got to have a way in which you can communicate all the work that you have done with something else a way that’s language independent we will have all kinds of languages in my lifetime in computer sciences i have seen over  languages i used to code myself in pl programming language  used by ibm on mainframes it’s like saying that a pen is more important than the poem

addresses from privacy policy thank you your message has been sent sorry there was an error emailing this page more like this quark launches quarkxpress  quarkxpress app studio arrives quark talks open standards indesign competition video macworldiworld highlights creative workflows quark developer of the desktop publishing software quarkxpress has been acquired by platinum equity a los angeles merger and acquisition company for an undisclosed sum quark which is privately held was previously owned by the ebrahimi family which bought it from founder tim gill in  on august  the children of farhad fred ebrahimi who retired in  completed a transaction in which they sold all of their quark shares for cash and handed over control of the company to platinum equityquark said the purpose of this transaction is to strengthen the company and give it the flexibility and financial facility to fulfill its goal of becoming a category leader in the realm of dynamic and digital publishingour interest is to have financial backers that canhelp us focus on our core markets and more specifically to create an acquisition strategy thats focused on helping us expand the breadth and depth of our product capabilities and our geographic coverage said quark president and ceo raymond schiavone being familyowned there are certain constraints so we sought to find a partner that could help us execute our strategy we found a fantastic partner that is expert in mergers and acquisitions and operations so this gives us some capabilities that we didnt have with the prior ownershipthis transaction is good news for quark according to thad mcilroy an electronic publishing consultant analyst and author and principal of the future of publishing based in vancouver british columbia i knew that the quark executives were highly skilled and capable of taking quark in a new direction and yet quark did not move in a new direction the product developed in interesting ways but they werent being very aggressive in the marketplaceso they decided to start shopping the company around to get some new blood and new financing and they succeeded at doing that thats a major coup these days—to sell a publishing tools company its not the hottest sector in the universeplatinum equityfounded in  platinum equity has closed over  acquisitions and has over  billion in combined annual revenue across acquisitions at the point of acquisition according to its website its portfolio includes a diverse array of companies acquired via corporate divestitures publictoprivate transactions and transactions with private sellers it is now involved with companies spanning the entertainment industrial it services and software manufacturing media and telecommunications and logistics and distribution categories“quark is a legendary brand that helped create the desktop publishing market and is now helping organizations transform how they publish content both to print and digital media” said brian wall partner at platinum in a statement “quark is committed to its loyal and dedicated user base and we are enthusiastic about the company’s new products which are gaining traction and generating positive reviews we believe that with their expertise and innovative software quark has the potential to revolutionize publishing again”with this transaction quark is positioning itself to offer what it calls an endtoend solution in dynamic publishing—from content creation to delivery to syndication it sees platinum equity as a means to help it acquire the right mix of technologies in strategic acquisitions to make that happen the dynamic publishing market is fragmented today said schiavone theres a number of companies that do very specific things we want to be the company that can provide the endtoend solution and be the market leader from the point of view of the industry as a whole the platinum equity buyout makes sense says mcilroy this is agnostic capital—money in search of an opportunity so it is a great endorsement of quark and its approach and of quarks future plans and longevity this says to us that quarks going to be around for some time that theyre going to be a player in the publishing tools spacewhat about adobethe elephant in the room is quarks archrival adobe from quarks perspective however adobe is tangential to its current publishing ambitions unlike adobe quark does not have its eye on other creation tools or web analytics specialties that adobe has been developing over time instead quark plans to concentrate on traditional markets such as newspapers and magazines as well as financial services life sciences government and manufacturing to provide those customers with the capability to automate their publishing processeswe do compete with adobe but there are some differences said schiavone all we do is publishingwe want to solve the publishing problem both for traditional publishers as well as large enterprises so we want to provide graphic designers and the folks creating print content today with the tools to participate in the digital age theres spots that will overlap with adobe but well be expanding into places that adobe is not deeply intothad mcillroy agrees the good news is that quark is wonderfully positioned between the consumer publishing market and the highend publishing market they understand the consumer and cross media publishing spaceand inasmuch as opportunities become available quark is well positioned to take advantage of themdigital publishing strategyas part of its digital publishing  strategy quark seeks to compete not only in the realm of print and online publishing but also in digital publishing of rich interactive content to a variety of mobile devices in multiple formatsearlier this year quark released quarkxpress  which updated the companys desktop publishing package and introduced a mobile component for the ios and other platforms integration of the new app studio into the package which will be available soon with the release of quarkxpress  will allow designers to publish directly to digital devices notably the ipad and eventually other tablets as well as to ereaders smart phones and other crossmedia systemsin choosing platinum equity as a partner quark seeks to maintain its independence and to eliminate questions about its customer relations and its ability to make decisions we continue to operate exactly as we did before the acquisition continue to support our clients and were a separate standalone business just as we were before—same people same name
