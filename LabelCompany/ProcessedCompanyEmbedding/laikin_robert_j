admired companies and is included in the fortune  brightpoint has operations in more than  countries and employs more than  people worldwide brightpoint is a company that has undergone a major evolution having faced both good times and challenging times will you provide an overview of the progression of the company i started the company in  and in that first year we sold  million worth of phones we doubled the business after going public in  going from  million in  to  million in  in  we changed the name to brightpoint i then bought our biggest competitor allied communications for stock and our market valuation approached  million from an ipo valuation of  million then we bought another competitor and sales doubled again but we started to run out of money so we did a  million secondary offering and then started making acquisitions internationally at the same time i realized that the pcs license process was heating up and that the companies bidding for licenses were sprint mci and att i knew that existing companies already had the infrastructure warehouses and employees to purchase the equipment and that the new entrants were going to need something to differentiate themselves in the marketplace by providing some customization so we built a squarefoot stateoftheart building with the technologies to take care of those needs the business kept growing and the market value in  grew to a high of  billion in the middle of  merrill lynch helped us raise  million from a stock offering  million of which was company stock and  million of which went to an outside shareholder from a previous acquisition in  we were able to raise an additional  million in proceeds from a convertible bond sale even in the face of evergrowing very public short sales some short firms named brightpoint as the “short sale of the year” after a period of tremendous growth to our top line revenue we started analyzing the profitability of all of our operations and realized that we had some serious problems we immediately put into place a global restructuring plan toward the end of  all of a sudden our market value which when the restructuring started was over  billion dropped to  million then with the tech bubble burst in  the market value went down to  million and by june  our market value was  million we had  million in total cash and we had  million in bonds outstanding that were still trading at  cents on the dollar i ended up buying  percent of the bonds back at  cents on the dollar our market cap went back to  million within  days it climbed back to approximately  billion in  and from  to  our market cap was at an alltime high and we were heroes again we had consolidated to  or  great countries but we decided it was time to expand again in  we acquired dangaard telecom in an allstock deal for  million shares of stock valued at  million and the assumption of over  million in debt in  with dangaard’s results and ours we had revenue of  billion an alltime high we were added to the fortune  list for the first time in  how do you project your industry will change in the next several years we’re focusing our rd on the services that we’ll be adding and they aren’t in the distribution business phones are becoming smarter today about  percent of the  billion phones sold are smart phones in three to five years it will be  percent of all phones sold at least in the mature markets smart phones need customization and software programming five years from now when you go to a restaurant you’re going to have a reservation there that you made through your smart

brightpoint values an interview with robert j laikin chairman of the board and chief executive officer brightpoint inc editors note in  robert laikin launched brightpoint from its inception as wholesale cellular to a multibillion dollar fortune  global leader in the wireless device distribution and supply chain solutions space since august  he has been its founder and director and has been chairman of the board and chief executive officer since january  from june  to september  he was president of the company and vice president and treasurer from august  until may  from july  to december  he was vice president and from january  to february  he was president of century cellular network inc laikin received his degree in business administration from indiana university company brief with operations in more than  countries and employing approximately  people worldwide brightpoint inc wwwbrightpointcom is a global leader in the distribution of wireless devices and in providing supply chain solution services to the global wireless industry the company’s innovative services include distribution channel development fulfillment product customization ebusiness solutions and other outsourced services that integrate seamlessly with its customers when you look at the past  months and the global economic crisis were you surprised at how severe it was and do you now see the market stabilizing at brightpoint we were about three months ahead of the rest of the folks in our industry and the rest of the world in realizing that there was a significant slowdown happening but we like everyone else underestimated how severe it was going to be we also started to see a recovery earlier than everyone else in the first quarter of  the wireless industry is very different compared to other industries because the product lifecycle has been changing rapidly since the early ’s when wireless was invented the replacement cycle has benefitted the whole wireless industry over the years you’ve not just had the growth of new users but also people trading in and upgrading their devices the embedded base grew so much that the industry was fortunate enough to grow even through multiple recessions since  how challenging has it been for brightpoint to continue to show those unique qualities that set you apart for the manufacturers operators mobile virtual network operators mvnos and retailers that we provide services for there has been a real challenge for them to not be perceived as a commodity airtime providers have been trying to differentiate themselves with coverage quality of service and different offerings related to content on the handset side it’s very similar so we built brightpoint’s business model around providing different services for network operators mvnos manufacturers and retailers to help them differentiate their products and services and be a competitive force in the marketplace our goal as a company is to provide flexible services that can be customized for the hardware per the requirements of the consumer and for how the consumer is going to get that product bundled with the service we have to bet on the right partners that we believe are going to be the winners in the future otherwise if we don’t invest the time in educating new companies coming into the space about brightpoint and handicapping the industry the right way we would miss opportunities we were also fortunate in predicting the smartphone trend and aligning ourselves with smartphone manufacturers like rim and htc in addition to leaders including samsung nokia and motorola on the operator side we have also been successful in aligning with telefónica vodafone teliasonera telenor debitel tracfone virgin mobile tmobile sprint cricket and metro pcs among others so our goal is to always align with industry leaders and new entrants on the network operator and hardware side as well as with new marketers who create innovative ideas for taking airtime and hardware to consumers one of the big focus areas for us is the proliferation of the android mobile operating system we saw android as an alternative to a lot of the other operating systems so we aligned ourselves with google not only were we successful with google’s directtoconsumer program but brightpoint was selected to be the logistics provider to google for their nexus one product which allowed us to be endorsed by google as the leading supply chain services provider to everyone from motorola to htc to acer and the other players getting involved with android so for new hardware manufacturers who want to take their products to  markets around the world in an efficient manner with the best price quality and flexibility they look to brightpoint as a natural partner do you foresee broadening the global footprint of the brand in the future from the  countries where we operate we service plus markets in addition to being a leader in the us we touch about one out of every three handsets sold in the us in europe we’re in more markets than any of our competitors we’re also focused on eastern europe middle east africa central america and colombia we haven’t yet figured out the right recipe to be successful for the riskreward in latin america but we’re looking at several opportunities in asiapacific we have operations in hong kong singapore india australia and new zealand we like our footprint there but we’re not in china and we’re analyzing alternatives to enter that market we’re in south africa and dubai and we’re studying ways to expand in the african market as smartphone penetration goes from today’s percentage of  to  percent over the next three to five years if smartphone penetration as a percentage of all devices sold increases the opportunity to sell our supply chain services increases significantly how challenging is it to stay on top of new technology when it is changing and evolving so quickly being the leader and consolidator in our industry the pure wireless investment on wall street and being able to tell our story over the years has fed upon itself and created huge opportunities for us with the new manufacturers and marketers who are creating the new technologies if there is one thing we don’t have it’s lack of opportunity we’ve been public since  and a leader since  and we have acquired many of our competitors on a global basis most people entering this space with new technology or services want access to the consumers through store shelves or directtoconsumer platforms in  brighpoint expects to touch approximately  million wireless devices out of a total of  to  billion devices that will be sold new technology developers want access to our platform and our channels as well as the customization and the services that we provide because we’ve already built the railroad that would be cost prohibitive for companies to try to build themselves then our potential partners look at the track records of the customers that we provide services for today and look at our  plus bb customers who represent over  points of sale and it’s a pretty easy decision to align with brightpoint going forward will it be important to be of a certain size and scale to survive will niche players be able to compete this industry is going to become so complicated with new applications and new uses for wireless devices that you need the ability to provide not only scale and geographic reach but also the technological capabilities to tie in a wireless number to a desktop behind a firewall for the enterprise user along with tying into the retailer through edi or the web sites and to be able to track all of the proprietary information within the device while providing mobile device management services like remotely turning the devices off an important security feature there are so many permutations of how the device is going to be used that if you don’t have a good balance sheet to invest in new technology and security then you’re going to slip behind quickly you also need a proven engine that has been able to deliver and support tens of millions of devices when you’re dealing with technology leaders they want to ensure that this service level is being delivered by a wellestablished credible company that has done it before versus a startup or a smaller company who may have a good solution in one country in eastern europe mexico or india but hasn’t taken it outside of their local market that gives brightpoint a competitive advantage during the recession of  and  we saw many of our smaller regional competitors go out of business because of deteriorated balance sheets several manufacturers also took some heavy bad debt writeoffs because our smaller competitors were either undercapitalized overleveraged or operating multiple businesses out of the same company where they were invested in real estate or retail one of the reasons for our gain in market share over the past two years is because we have had the strongest balance sheet along with our industryleading service offerings there will always be competitors on a regional basis but we’re confident we will continue to grow market share in the category of wireless devices handled and we’re never going to rest on our laurels you have a clearly defined set of values for brightpoint how critical have those values been to attracting and retaining talent the brightpoint values – integrity accomplishment quality respect learning and community involvement – are critical to our people in the  countries in which we operate we embrace our communities by having our people commit their time to volunteering within them we have been awarded the designation as one of fortune magazine’s most admired companies several times and we didn’t get that designation by just being a company that was successful in handling devices it was the community involvement and the values that we try to share with our associates around the world when you have an organization that has good values and is part of the community it allows us to go out and find the best talent we look for people who want to be part of the leading company in a growing industry that has a global organization we look to bring people in who have different backgrounds and talents and who are diverse in order to help develop the people that work at the company now because we want to keep changing our employees need to continue to develop their talents as well and we have a focus on leadership development programs to support them has it been challenging for you to relinquish some of your involvement as the business has grown absolutely in the late ’s and ’s i was the salesman the finance director and i collected bills and packed boxes – i did what i had to do to please my customers and suppliers when we went public in  we had  employees but i did everything just as the other  people did when we did the ipo i enjoyed getting to know investors and analysts in the wireless industry and leaders with new technology on the hardware side and on the operator side and i had to give up the daily selling and many other duties but i stayed involved with selling some major customers from  to  i gave up a lot of the operational and finance opportunities but i assembled a great management team and acquired several companies during the ’s and became a global company did i find it challenging yes but i was too busy doing what i had to do with public offerings in  and  and  and  as well as last year and along the way we made some mistakes we grew too fast in the ’s and we had to do a lot of restructuring from  to  because our market cap went from over  billion in the ’s to only  million in  it was a personal challenge to survive and so i spent my time renegotiating with bondholders banks and suppliers and keeping wall street interested in brightpoint from  to  the market cap went from  million to more than  billion and it was personally rewarding because i had kept my global team together we then acquired assets of one of our largest competitors in the mids and in the late s acquired our biggest competitor in europe then we had challenges in integrating the acquisitions or assets of those companies and continuing to educate all of the associates of those organizations about what it means to be associated with brightpoint as we entered  concerns about brightpoint’s integrations and restructurings and our balance sheet all ended because we were successful and focused we have been able to catch our breath a bit and the good news is our industry is starting to grow again and we’re growing faster than our industry in terms of the embedded base of wireless devices which is over  billion today our customers have a reason to get a new device that needs new customization and programming and put it in the hands of their customers with some new permutation or complication that brightpoint then builds and supports or has predicted as a service and built it in advance so when technology changes we are the default partner to help the retailers operators and manufacturers deliver that new device to meet the needs of the consumer and to make it a seamless transaction do you think that smartphones make it difficult to find a worklife balance today smartphones are a curse personally and a blessing for my industry because people just can’t turn them off people get addicted to these devices and always want to update them so even though we don’t have direct relationships with every player in the industry our industry will always sell over a billion devices a year because the base is so big and the technology keeps changing• click here to download a pdf of an interview with robert j
