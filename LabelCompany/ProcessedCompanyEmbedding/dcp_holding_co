network and process and pay claims aso fees are recognized as revenue when they are earned   our products primarily consist of dental hmo dental ppo and dental indemnity plans with dental hmo products constituting  of our total revenues all of our products are marketed to employer groups our business model allows us to offer dental benefit products including broad networks of participating dentists while at the same time promoting the use of private practice feeforservice dentistry a primary interest of our participating dentists the dental benefit products we offer currently vary depending on geographic market our objective is to offer our dental hmo products in all markets we serve in both fullyinsured or selfinsured forms similar to our competitors dental ppo products our dental hmo products provide members with access to a broad provider network   we currently market our dental hmo dental ppo and dental indemnity plans to employers in select ohio kentucky and indiana counties

the markets outside of our original eight county service area including daytonspringfield ohio and louisville and lexington kentucky our products are often offered to employer groups as bundles where the subscribers are offered a combination of dental hmo dental ppo and dental indemnity options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer   individuals become subscribers of our dental plans through their employers qualified family members of these subscribers become members through such individuals employers pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees   fullyinsured dental hmo   our fullyinsured dental hmo products segment includes our dental care plus dental hmo plan under our dental hmo plan premiums are paid to dental care plus by the employer and members receive access to our dentist network in their region plan designs range from full premium payouts by the employer to shared contributions of varying proportions by the employer and its employees to full payment by the employees there are no waiting periods and there is no balance billing in our fullyinsured dental hmo covered dental services are  table of contents segmented into three categories preventative basic and major services typically covered at   and  respectively in most cases each member has a  annual maximum benefit and  lifetime orthodontia maximum benefit for the year ended december   fullyinsured dental hmo premiums totaled approximately  million or  of our total premiums and aso fees   selfinsured dental hmo   our selfinsured dental hmo segment includes only our aso product which we offer through dental care plus to employers who selfinsure their employee dental plans these employers pay all claims according to our fee schedule we receive fees to provide administrative services that generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and responding to customer service inquiries from members of these plans this product is offered only to larger employer groups that have the financial resources to bear the claims risk for the dental benefits of employees and their family members selfinsured employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of dental benefits selfinsured employers may purchase stop loss insurance coverage from thirdparty carriers to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december   selfinsured aso fees totaled approximately  million or  of our total premiums and aso fees   corporate all other   we offer dental ppo and dental indemnity products underwritten by dental care plus we also offer dental ppo dental indemnity and vision ppo benefit plans that are underwritten by thirdparty insurance carriers our subsidiary insurance associates is an insurance agency licensed in ohio kentucky and indiana that markets our thirdparty dental ppo and vision benefit products insurance associates earns commissions and administrative fees based on members enrolled in the dental ppo and vision benefit plans our dental indemnity product dentapremier is marketed by our internal sales staff and local insurance brokers our dental ppo dental indemnity and vision benefit product lines collectively aggregated approximately  million in premiums or less than  of total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december     dentaselect   our dental ppo product dentaselect was introduced in  and is administered by an independent third party administrator tpa dentaselect includes some elements of managed health care however it includes more costsharing with the member through premium contributions copayments and annual deductibles employers and their participating employees typically share the cost of premiums in various contribution proportions premiums are paid to dental care plus or a thirdparty insurance carrier the dentaselect ppo also is similar to traditional health insurance because it provides a member with more freedom to choose a dentist members are encouraged through financial incentives to use participating dentists who have contracted with us to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the providers fees   dentapremier   since  we have been offering dentapremier a dental indemnity product to employers who participate in our dental care plus hmo fullyinsured and selfinsured plans with out of area members or members that require complete freedom of provider access we introduced this plan because many ohio kentucky and indiana employer groups have employees in other states performing sales or service functions dentapremier is a traditional dental indemnity plan that allows members to use any dentist they wish employers and their participating employees typically share the cost of premiums in various contribution proportions as with our dental hmo products members are responsible for paying standard deductible amounts and copayments premium rates for dentapremier are generally higher than premium rates for our dental hmo products in  dental care plus entered into a contract with a thirdparty insurance carrier to underwrite this plan in october of  the majority of these dental indemnity members were transitioned to dental care plus insurance policies   vision care plus   our vision benefit ppo product vision care plus is underwritten and administered by an independent tpa members can access both network and outofnetwork vision care providers and are subject to fixed copayments and benefit limits premium cost is typically shared by employers and their participating employees in various contribution proportions we began offering vision care plus in  to dental care plus employer groups whose existing contracts are up for renewal as well as to new employer groups  table of contents seasonality of dental service utilization   based on our healthcare service expense on a per member per month pmpm basis that adjusts the quarterly healthcare service expense for membership volume changes our dental plan members have historically used their dental plan benefits according to a seasonal pattern that has caused our quarterly healthcare services expense to be highest in the first quarter slightly below average in the second quarter slightly above average in the third quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter the following table shows these trends in tabular form                                                         healthcare service expense                        s     pmpm     s     pmpm     s     pmpm     first quarter                                           second quarter                                           third quarter                                           fourth quarter                                             claims are higher in the first quarter because almost all of our employersponsored plan years commence on january  the third quarter increase is primarily due to the high level of dental services used in august by student members prior to returning to school use of dental services is lowest in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season and the fact that a portion of our members have already reached their maximum annual benefit level for the year   business strategy   our objective is to become one of the largest providers of dental benefits in the midwest our strategy is to continue increasing membership in all of our plans by gaining new employer group customers acquiring other similar dental plans adding more participating dentists to our hmo provider networks and increasing our product offerings we intend to further develop the use of dental indemnity and ppo products as a means to grow membership sufficient to support the addition of more provider relations staff to recruit dentists into our dental hmo provider network because we believe the dental hmo products marketed by dental care plus represent our best competitive advantage   our dental care plus hmo plans offer both the broad provider access ordinarily attributed to a dental ppo and the utilization review and cost control features of a dental hmo the combination of a large provider network competitive pricing and renewal practices and an emphasis on outstanding customer service have allowed us to effectively compete with dental ppos because we are primarily owned by dentists who participate in our dental care plus plans and our dentists are reimbursed on a feeforservice basis we often have a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining dentists for our network   membership retention   employers generally contract with our dental hmo plans for a period of one year continuous marketing and sales efforts are made to obtain contract renewals on an annual basis the ability to obtain contract renewals depends on our premium schedules competitive bids received by employers from our competitors and employee satisfaction with our plans among other factors the cost of replacing lost members is higher than retaining members accordingly membership retention is a primary focus of our marketing efforts we strive for consistent employer and broker contacts and fair justified renewal pricing in order to increase retention rates due to these membership retention efforts we achieved a retention rate of approximately  in  compared to retention rates of  and  in  and  respectively   group billing and collection   we dedicate significant resources to achieving prompt and accurate billing for premiums claims and aso fees we also have a structured process for monitoring and collecting our accounts receivable   customer service   we provide customer service to employer group administrators members and dentists customer service representatives respond promptly to employer and member inquiries regarding member identification cards and benefit determinations and provider staff inquiries regarding eligibility benefit verification and claims payments we strive to answer questions in one phone call we monitor key customer service statistics in order to maintain positive customer relationships with all constituencies  table of contents information technology   in february  our new dental plan administration system became fully operational this system allows us to easily adapt to benefit changes sought by employer groups and allows for increased efficiencies and costs savings in the functional areas of group marketing enrollment billing collections cash application claims adjudication and claims payment by reducing manual processing and facilitating the development of electronic membership enrollment electronic group billing and automated cash application in addition with the new system we expect an increase in the percentage of claims that can be electronically loaded and adjudicated we are also focused on the importance of data integrity ease of data extraction and interfacing with banks clearinghouses and other business partners   we lease our dental plan administration system equipment under a master equipment lease with the fifth third leasing company dated october   the lease term with respect to equipment commenced on january   and expires january   under this lease we are obligated to pay the bank  per month at the end of the lease term we have the option of either purchasing or returning the equipment the equipment must be purchased at its fair market value defined as the amount agreed upon between us and the lessor or if not so agreed the amount determined by an independent appraiser we also lease our dental plan administration software under the master equipment lease the lease term with respect to software commenced on january   and expires january   under this lease we are obligated to pay the bank  per month at the end of the lease we retain use of the software and will pay monthly maintenance fees directly to the software vendor   dentist networks   we maintain two separate dental networks comprised of dentists who have contracted with company subsidiaries as of december   we had provider contracts with  dentists of these participating dentists  dentists are located in ohio  dentists are located in kentucky  dentists are located in indiana and  dentists are located in other states only participating dentists who were in our original eight county area may hold class a redeemable common shares of the company which are the only voting shares in the company of the  participating dentists  are shareholders who each own one class a voting redeemable common share most of these  shareholders also own  or more class b nonvoting redeemable common shares there are also  shareholders who are retired dentists each of whom owns  class b nonvoting redeemable common shares   we actively recruit dentist providers in each of our markets in some instances we identify expansion area counties where additional providers are needed and locate dentists in these expansion area counties by reviewing state dental licensure records in other cases new employer group customers request that we work to recruit specific dentists their employees desire to have access to in our provider network   before a dentist can become a participating provider we engage in extensive due diligence on the dentists professional licenses training and experience and malpractice history the dentist must also be recommended by our credentialing committee consisting of five experienced dentists who are members of our board of directors the board   our provider contracts require that participating dentists participate in periodic fee surveys for the purpose of establishing our fee schedule to participate in and be bound by our utilization review and credentialing plans see utilization control and quality assurance policies below to participate in the peer review program of their state dental association to maintain a state license in good standing to practice dentistry to maintain professional liability insurance coverage in amounts determined by our board and to maintain patient records in a confidential manner our provider contracts are for a term of one year and may be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless a written termination notice is given by either party on  days notice   participating dentists are reimbursed for services provided to members of our dental plans on a feeforservice basis based on a maximum allowable fee schedule we have developed or the actual fee charged by the dentist whichever is less in the case of our dental hmo reimbursements to dentists are subject to a percentage withhold of the amount otherwise payable to the dentist at the end of each fiscal year our board evaluates the performance of our dental hmo plans capital and surplus requirements prescribed by the ohio department of insurance factors impacting our financial strength rating funding needed to support strategic objectives for the coming years and any other factors deemed relevant by the board and based on that evaluation determines the amount of the withhold that should be paid to dentists if any if we have met our capital and surplus requirements as  table of contents prescribed by the ohio department of insurance see state regulations and federal regulations below and have the necessary funding to support our strategic objectives the board will generally authorize a provider withhold payment out of excess capital although there is no requirement to authorize such withhold return   our networks are important to the success of our dental hmo plans and our ppo plan we have a dedicated provider relations department that communicates with network dentists and performs periodic credentialing and recredentialing of each participating dentist   we provide access to our dental care plus provider network for a fee to a select group of selfinsured employer groups represented by independent tpas in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky each tpa pays dental care plus a network access fee on behalf of the selfinsured employer group based on the number of employees using the network the selfinsured employer group members gain access to the dental care plus provider network and the tpa pays the provider claims in accordance with the dental care plus fee schedule the network providers have consented to this arrangement in their provider contracts   employees   in  we employed a total of  employees we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions and believe that our overall relations with our employees are good   sales and marketing   we market our dental plans primarily to employers through certain sales personnel and approximately  independent insurance brokers located in southwestern ohio dayton ohio northern kentucky and central kentucky approximately  of our membership comes from the efforts of these independent insurance brokers one independent broker sourced approximately  of our business in  two other brokers sourced a substantial portion of our business each accounting for approximately  of our business in    many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume pursuant to our standard broker agreement in addition to commissions based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents on other bases these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers   utilization control and quality assurance policies   utilization control and quality assurance policies are essential to our success our reimbursement structure limits the frequency of various procedures in order to control utilization of dental care by members of our fullyinsured and selfinsured dental plans   each dentist in our networks is obligated to adhere to our utilization review program noncompliance or continued deviations from the utilization review program will result in sanctions against a dentist such sanctions may include probation suspension or expulsion as a participating dentist and may also affect the dentists ability to receive compensation from the plan for services provided to subscribers we believe that a stringent utilization review program is necessary to provide adequate cost containment   our board of directors appoints a committee of dentists to ensure that the utilization review program is met and continually upgraded as appropriate the utilization reviewquality assurance committee urqa committee is charged with reviewing service patterns of providers and requests for pretreatment estimates that do not clearly meet appropriate standards   the urqa committee is also charged with retrospective review of all covered services provided by a dentist to determine whether the frequency and nature of the services are in compliance with standards adopted by the urqa committee the urqa committee may recommend that the participating agreement of a dentist who is not in  table of contents compliance with these standards be terminated suspended or not renewed or that benefits paid to the provider for particular services rendered by him or her be reduced   credentialing   the credentialing committee which is comprised of dentists and is appointed by our board of directors has oversight over the credentialing of new dentist providers that apply to be participating providers in our provider networks this committee oversees the periodic recredentialing of dentist providers already in one of our existing provider networks and evaluates whether a dentist should be terminated from one of the provider networks if an action is filed against the dentist with a state department of insurance or other regulatory agency or the provider loses his medical malpractice insurance coverage due to an adverse claim the credentialing committee is also charged in part with ensuring that all participating dentists maintain good standing with regulatory agencies the recommendations of the credentialing committee are forwarded to our board of directors for consideration any decision of the board of directors whether relating to paymentcoverage disputes or sanctions is final   risk management   through the use of internallydeveloped underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our dental benefit products employer groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage   competition   the marketing and sale of fullyinsured and selfinsured dental benefit plans is highly competitive rising health care benefit premiums and changes in the economy have had an impact on the number of companies able to offer dental benefits to their employees a significant portion of the employers who offer our plans are in the education government and health care industries concentration of business in these industries insulates us from membership decreases that competitors may face if the economy were to enter into a sluggish or recessionary period   we primarily compete with fullline dental only plans other dental hmo carriers and national insurance companies that offer dental or vision coverage many of the companies with whom we compete are larger have wellestablished local regional andor national reputations and have substantially greater financial and sales resources it is possible that other competitors will emerge as the market for dental plans continues to develop   our major competitors are delta dental of ohio and delta dental of kentucky these competitors operate as dental hmos and dental ppos in which members receive certain benefit incentives to receive services from network dentists dental ppo members may also use nonnetwork dentists but at reduced benefit levels   additional competitors include national insurance companies such as guardian met life humana and anthem these companies offer dental indemnity and dental ppo plans most of these dental plans are similar to those offered by us in design and they also pay providers on a feeforservice basis dental indemnity plans lack the basic characteristics of a dental hmo plan including contractually enforced utilization and quality assurance standards and limitations on dentists fees and members are not restricted to participating dentists dental ppo plans include both innetwork benefits similar to those of a dental hmo plan and outofnetwork benefits like those associated with a dental indemnity plan   our ability to offer either or both a dental indemnity plan and a ppo plan has had a positive impact on our membership growth we are currently licensed to underwrite dental hmo dental ppo and dental indemnity plans in ohio in addition we are licensed to underwrite dental hmo and dental ppo in kentucky some of our dental indemnity and dental ppo offerings are still underwritten by third party underwriters   our main competitors in the fullyinsured vision benefit area are vision service plan and eyemed a subsidiary of lenscrafters we believe that our vision benefit plans are competitively priced and include sufficient benefits to compete effectively  table of contents our dental benefits market share of approximately  to  in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky market gives us a strong competitive position this market share is due to our large provider network competitive pricing and customer service in  our dental membership in southwestern ohio increased to approximately  members as of december   from approximately  members as of december   dental membership in northern kentucky increased to approximately  members by the end of  from approximately  members at the end of    we have less than  total members in the dayton and springfield ohio market we have developed a provider network in dayton ohio that includes approximately  of the licensed dentists in the area since the introduction of the dentaselect ppo product in  our relationships with brokers in this area have improved and we have added a significant number of employer groups as of december   we had approximately  dental ppo members and approximately  dental hmo members in the dayton and springfield market   with the acquisition of adenta we became a competitor in the dental benefits market in central kentucky with approximately  dental members consisting of approximately  group members and  individual members as of june  with the addition of approximately  network dentists via the adenta acquisition we now have a network of approximately  dentists which represents approximately  of the licensed dentists in central kentucky we have transitioned approximately  of the  adenta group members acquired at renewal to either the dentaselect ppo product or the dental care plus hmo product in addition we have been building insurance broker relationships in central kentucky and have been quoting on new employer groups in this market as of december   we had no adenta members approximately  dental hmo members and approximately  dental ppo members in our central kentucky market   customers   during  approximately  of our fullyinsured premium revenue was generated by four employers also during  approximately  of our net selfinsured administration and claims revenue was generated by two employers one of these employers the health alliance of greater cincinnati generated approximately  of our consolidated revenue while we believe that our relationship with each of these employers is good there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case the termination of our relationship with any one of these employers could have a material adverse effect on the company as we continue to increase the number of employers and members in our dental plans our dependence on these employers as a source of revenue and enrollment will lessen in proportion to our total revenue and size   each of our customers signs a standard form agreement which differs depending on whether the customer is fullyinsured or selfinsured there are two standard form agreements for fullyinsured customers  one for employersponsored plans and one for voluntary employee plans all of our standard form agreements are for one year terms and automatically renew for additional oneyear terms either party may terminate our fullyinsured customer contracts by giving  days prior written notice and our selfinsured customer contracts by giving  days prior written notice the premium rates set forth in each fullyinsured customer contract remain in effect during each one year term and may only be increased at renewal   state regulations   general   state insurance laws and other governmental regulations establish various licensing operational financial and other requirements relating to our business state insurance departments in ohio kentucky and indiana are empowered to interpret such laws of their respective states and promulgate regulations applicable our business   the national association of insurance commissioners naic is a voluntary association of all of the state insurance commissioners in the united states the primary function of the naic is to develop model laws on key insurance regulatory issues that can be used as guidelines for individual states in adopting or enacting insurance legislation while naic model laws are accorded substantial deference within the insurance industry these laws are not binding and variations from the model laws from state to state are common  table of contents in  dental care plus was dually licensed as a life and health insurance company and a health insuring corporation providing specialty health care services under ohio law as a limited health service benefit plan in kentucky and as a dental hmo in indiana the regulations of each state insurance department include specific requirements with regard to such matters as minimum capital and surplus reserves permitted investments contract terms policy forms claims processing requirements and annual reports if dental care plus fails to maintain compliance with all material regulations regulatory authorities are empowered to take certain actions against it such as revoking its license imposing monetary penalties or taking over supervision of its operations or seeking a court order for the rehabilitation liquidation or conservation of dental care plus   insurance associates plus is licensed in ohio kentucky and illinois as an insurance agency as such it is required to have at least one insurance agent licensed in each of those states if insurance associates plus fails to meet this requirement in ohio kentucky or illinois its license could be revoked by the state   adenta is licensed as a prepaid dental plan and as a life and health insurance agency in kentucky recent changes to kentucky law have lessened the regulatory requirements applicable to adenta including elimination of the requirement to file annual reports with the kentucky office of insurance   naic accounting principles   in  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles that became the naics primary guidance on statutory accounting the ohio department of insurance has adopted the codification statutory accounting practices sap differ in some respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the significant difference for the company is       similar to gaap deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the statutory and tax bases of assets and liabilities for sap however statutory deferred tax assets are limited based upon tests that determine what is an admitted asset under sap under sap the change in deferred taxes is recorded directly to surplus as opposed to gaap where the change is recorded to current operations   risk based capital   the naics riskbased capital for life andor health insurers model act the model act provides a tool for insurance regulators to determine the levels of statutory capital and surplus an insurer must maintain in relation to its insurance and investment risks and whether there is a need for possible regulatory action the model act or similar legislation or regulation has been adopted in states where dental care plus does business the model act provides for three levels of regulatory action varying with the ratio of the insurance companys total adjusted capital defined as the total of its statutory capital and surplus asset valuation reserve and certain other adjustments to its authorized control level riskbased capital rbc       if a companys total adjusted capital is less than or equal to  percent but greater than  percent of its rbc the company action level the company must submit a comprehensive plan aimed at improving its capital position to the regulatory authority proposing corrective actions       if a companys total adjusted capital is less than or equal to  percent but greater than  percent of its rbc the regulatory action level the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying the corrective actions that must be followed       if a companys total adjusted capital is less than or equal to  percent of its rbc the mandatory control level the regulatory authority must place the company under its control   in addition to the levels of regulatory action described above the regulatory authority may impose restrictions reporting or other requirements on companies whenever the regulatory authority determines that the financial condition of the company warrants such action notwithstanding the fact the company meets the requirements of the model act a regulatory authority may also seek an order of the courts placing the company in rehabilitation liquidation or conservation whenever the regulatory authority determines that the companys financial condition is hazardous notwithstanding the fact that the company may be in compliance with the requirements of the model act   dental care pluss statutory annual statements for the year ended december   filed with the ohio department of insurance reflected total adjusted capital in excess of company action level rbc  table of contents federal regulations   hipaa administrative simplification   the health insurance portability and accountability act of  hipaa authorized the us department of health and human services hhs to adopt a series of regulations designed to simplify the exchange of information electronically between health plans and health care providers and to promote efficiency within the health care industry as well as to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information pursuant to this authority hhs has adopted a series of regulations which are applicable to covered entities which include health care providers health plans and health care clearinghouses collectively the hipaa regulations the hipaa regulations adopted to date require covered entities to do the following  comply with uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in certain transactions between health care providers and health plans related to the administration of benefits and payment of claims standard electronic transactions regulations  adopt certain policies and procedures with respect to the use and disclosure of certain protected health information phi created received or maintained by the covered entity whether in electronic or paper form and provide individuals with a written notice of how the covered entity will use and disclose phi and of the individuals rights with respect to phi privacy regulations  adopt certain policies and procedures and implement certain technical safeguards to protect the security of electronic phi security regulations  use certain uniform unique identifiers when conducting transactions with health care providers standard provider identifier regulations and employers standard employer identifier regulations covered entities are currently required to be in compliance with the standard electronic transactions regulations the privacy regulations the security regulations and the standard employer identifier regulations the compliance date for the standard provider identifier regulations is may     enforcement of the hipaa regulations is vested in the office of civil rights of hhs which has the power to investigate compliance and complaints sanctions for failing to comply with or for violation of the hipaa regulations include criminal penalties of up to  per violation and civil sanctions of up to  per violation   many of the hipaa regulations are complex and requests for regulatory clarification of many aspects are still pending additional standards under the standards electronic transactions regulations are also pending and additional regulations requiring unique identifiers for other entities including health plans may be adopted little compliance activity has occurred to date leaving few official sources of interpretation available beyond the original commentary which accompanied the final hipaa regulations we have however made a good faith effort to comply and believe we are in compliance with the requirements of the hipaa regulations that are applicable to our subsidiaries as of this date   glba   the financial services modernization act of  the grammleachbliley act or glba contains privacy provisions and introduced new controls over the use of an individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions including insurance companies insurance agents and brokers licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities numerous pieces of federal and state legislation aimed at protecting the privacy of nonpublic personal financial and health information are pending the privacy provisions of glba that became effective in july  require a financial institution to provide written notice of its privacy practices to all of its customers in addition a financial institution is required to provide its customers with an opportunity to opt out of certain uses of their nonpublic personal information we believe that we are in compliance with the glba privacy regulations   both glba and hipaa provide that there is no federal preemption of a states privacy laws if the state law is more stringent than the privacy rules imposed under glba or hipaa pursuant to the authority granted under glba to state insurance regulatory authorities to regulate the national association of insurance commissioners promulgated a new model regulation called privacy of consumer financial and health information regulation which was adopted by numerous state insurance authorities as well there are other preexisting state laws including but not limited to insurance regulatory statutes which were not preempted by glba or hipaa and which remain in effect we believe we are in compliance with state laws governing the privacy of personal financial and health information that are applicable to our subsidiaries to the extent such laws are
