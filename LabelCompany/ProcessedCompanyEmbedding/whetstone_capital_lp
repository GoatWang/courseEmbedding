david atterbury  whetstone capital lp  zoominfocom thomas mcgannon  whetstone capital lp  zoominfocom whetstone capital urges columbia pipeline partners unitholders to vote against merger with transcanada corporation  business wire whetstone capital urges columbia pipeline partners unitholders to vote against merger with transcanada corporation states that the current  per unit merger materially undervalues columbia pipeline partners and its network of uniquely positioned natural gas assets critical of transcanada for seeking to take advantage of its minority partners at an unfairly low price and reap the windfall explains that the only way for unitholders to preserve their ability to receive full and fair value for their investment is by rejecting the proposed merger at the reconvened special meeting on february  february    pm eastern standard time mission woods kanbusiness wirewhetstone capital advisors llc whetstone capital a significant unitholder of columbia pipeline partners lp nysecppl “cppl” or the “partnership” with ownership of approximately  of the common units outstanding issued a letter to cppl unitholders today urging them to vote against the proposed  per unit merger with transcanada corporation nyse trp the full text of the letter follows february   dear fellow columbia pipeline partners lp unitholders on february th transcanada “trp” held a special meeting to vote on the proposed sale of columbia pipeline partners lp “cppl” to trp for  per unit the meeting was adjourned and rescheduled for february th because a majority of the holders had not cast a vote either for or against the proposed sale we believe that the lack of quorum illustrates that longterm holders such as ourselves are dissatisfied with the offer price we are writing this letter to recommend that you vote against the proposed sale as of this writing and the january th record date we own approximately  units or  of the common units outstanding we have voted against the sale in favor of either a fairer offer or the opportunity to participate in the value created by the partnership’s ongoing organic growth program on september   cppl announced that it had received an unsolicited offer from trp to acquire the outstanding common units of cppl for  per unit nine weeks later trp raised their offer to  per unit the “lp offer” we believe that this offer materially understates the value of cppl and urge fellow unitholders to reject it based on our estimate of intrinsic value which takes into consideration transcanada’s acquisition of columbia pipeline group cpgx we believe the fair value of cppl is at least  per unit we would like to take the opportunity to share our thoughts on trp’s offer with fellow unitholders we like many cppl unitholders first invested with the company at its ipo in february  at  per unit we share trp’s enthusiasm for the quality and growth that columbia pipeline’s asset footprint offers in sharing this enthusiasm we don’t want to sell our interest in this business it is an irreplaceable and unmatched network of natural gas transmission pipes that blankets perhaps the most prolific natural gas basin in the world if we are forced to sell then we expect to get fairly compensated in march of last year trp announced its intent to acquire cpgx the “gp offer” the general partner of cppl for  per share in cash this valued cpgx at roughly x and x estimated  and  ebitda including forecasted idr payments respectively cpgxs only asset at the time was its ownership of columbia opco the entity through which all of columbia pipelines business and operations are conducted the lp offer of  for cppl would result in trp acquiring the remaining interest in opco at more than a  discount to the price it paid for the rest of the very same business one year ago at a time when the energy market was severely depressed we feel this is an attempt by trp to disadvantage its minority partners since trp announced the gp offer last march trp’s share price has increased over   denominated in usd adding nearly  billion to its market capitalization we believe that this strong performance is very much related to the market’s appreciation of the columbia pipeline assets the lp offer is a diminutive  premium to the average trading price during the month preceding trp’s gp offer today’s market is unequivocally better than the conditions that were present when trp made the gp offer natural gas prices have increased more than  as a result the credit quality and market capitalizations of columbia pipeline’s key producer counterparties have dramatically improved furthermore greenfield energy infrastructure projects in the northeast must overcome increasingly high hurdles and strong opposition eg constitution pipeline and northeast energy direct consequently we believe that the value of lowrisk brownfield expansion opportunities such as columbia pipeline’s  billion growth capex backlog has never been higher in the event that trp is unwilling to fairly compensate cppl we and other unitholders should be more than happy to continue with the status quo as a separate company outside of a scenario in which trp uses its position as general partner to punish cppl unitholders for being unwilling to take the lp offer we believe that cppl is wellpositioned to fund its share of growth capital expenditures currently columbia opco and by extension cppl carries less than x debttoebitda today’s debt market is favorable and cppl could readily access debt at a cost that is inline with investment grade mlps based on the capital expenditure and ebitda guidance that cpgx had previously provided we think that cppl could debt finance most if not all of its share of growth capital and maintain investment grade quality debt metrics we believe that trp’s lp offer significantly undervalues cppl in a “goit alone” situation we estimate that the lp offer values cppl at roughly x  ebitda adjusted for gp cash flows and growth capital expenditures assuming a more appropriate multiple of x ebitda which is in line with spectra energy partners cppl’s closest comparable we estimate that the fair value of cppl is near  per unit this estimate corresponds with our previously articulated approach of using the same multiple that trp paid for cpgx the exact same operating assets as cppl in much less favorable market conditions in closing we would like to implore transcanada to consider its image as a good corporate citizen and its ongoing reliance on the capital markets to fund over  billion in growth projects as trp’s code of business ethics highlights “transcanada prides itself on being a company that all of our stakeholders whether they are customers suppliers investors lenders regulators neighbors or employees can count on to make the right choices and do the right thing” we have remained investors in cppl since trp became our general partner in part because we believe transcanada intends to continue to “do the right thing” and treat its minority partners in a fair and equitable manner should anyone wish to discuss our thoughts and assumptions regarding our
