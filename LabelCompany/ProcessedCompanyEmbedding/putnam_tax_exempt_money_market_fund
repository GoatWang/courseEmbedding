and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest

stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to

fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased

any are taxable for federal and in most cases state purposes for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax income from federally taxexempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in

any are taxable for federal and in most cases state purposes for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax income from federally taxexempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in
