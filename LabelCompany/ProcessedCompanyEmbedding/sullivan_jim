cleansing nature and you working together in our modern society its easy to forget that we¬íre an integral part of nature that our bodies are part of a holistic living system that supports and nourishes us when were in good health its a sign we are not overworking our bodies there is a balance between what is taking place within our bodies and without that there is a balance when were feeling ill or out of sorts ¬ñ our bodies are sending us a signal that we are out of balance that we are out of sync herbal cleansing is a way to reset our personal system and help our bodies regain balance the herbal cleansing formulas we offer and dietary changes we suggest help the body expel accumulated waste and toxins but just as importantly a natural body detox supports and encourages our bodys own selfcleansing mechanisms ¬ñ our channels of elimination and detoxification themselves so while it may appear that these potent herbs may be doing all the work they are really designed to help our body to work better each of us has six interdependent channels of elimination and when we get all those channels working together seamlessly we feel healthy environmental concerns environmental concerns for the plants themselves are very important some plants have been collected so extensively that their lives are threatened in the wild there are even locations where the overpicking of herbs has completely eliminated some species wild ginseng root goldenseal root lady slipper root and false unicorn are just a few of the plants that are in threat of being over harvested when formulating products ensure that we are not using herbs that are on the endangered list we do our best to keep an eye of what is endangered so as not to contribute to the list of herbs that are being over harvested premium herbal quality guaranteed our herbs come from vendors who make sure the raw material they offer is pure of high quality and are actually what they say it is via dna herbal testing the secret to our success is maintaining open communication with our suppliers and manufacturers this gives us a surety of the quality and integrity of the herbs they provide this is not always easy but we are determined to keep establishing better communications and relationships with everyone who supplies the herbs we buy its important to get the highestgrade herbs available herb quality makes a huge difference in results a lot of products that have gotten into the marketplace over the last several years are of dubious origin we provide only the highest quality possible
