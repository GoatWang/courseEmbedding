through the uncertainty by duncan douglas g read preview article excerpt prediction is a very difficult art especially with respect to the future mark twain i receive a lot of phone calls from reporters and citizens asking whether this is a good time to buy a house while it sounds a little evasive the correct answer is yes if you can afford it the point is it is very difficult to forecast interest rates with any degree of accuracy therefore the consumer is welladvised to consider his or her current financial condition and housing needs or wants and then if at current market interest rates he or she can afford the desired house buy it  if rates go up the upside risk has been covered assuming the use of a fixedrate mortgage if rates go down the ease of refinancing offers a relatively lowcost way to reduce the monthly cost of ownership  so is this a good time to buy comes the followup the remarkable economy is showing some signs of weakness how serious are these signs what do they mean for the homebuying public how will they affect the nature quality and quantity of mortgage debt current and future what do these facts portend for mortgage bankers lets take a look at the current signs of weakness in the economy see how weak it actually is and try to see what the near future holds the recentand even notsorecentpast has been so good that it is easy to overstate

we have been in an economic expansion since the fourth quarter of 8 the current expansion phase which began in the second quarter of  has run for 7 consecutive months and we are not forecasting an end

has exceeded the  percent level concurrently with unemployment at or below  percent has not been inflationary in fact throughout this period inflation has been stable to falling this is really unprecedented in the modern us economy and has led to a lot of discussion about whether the fundamental structure of the economy has changed while labor costs have risen in the last several quarters labor productivity rose strongly as well see figure  the third quarter of  nonfarm business productivity registered  percent annualized rate which was off somewhat from the  percent and  percent of the first and second quarters in  but was up substantially from the 7 period the recent dramatic increase in productivity has largely offset the increases in labor costs as the increased wages and benefits can be viewed as payment to labor for additional output per hour worked thus the concern that costpush inflation would emerge from the tight labor market has been assuaged by high productivity levels rather than a new economy i view this as the old economy having had a cardiovascular event in the late 70s stagflation that event led to installation of a rigorous new exercise and
