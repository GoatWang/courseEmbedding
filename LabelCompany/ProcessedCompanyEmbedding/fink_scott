and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or

call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give

fink scott shapes passion for pottery into side career heather hamacek thursday june    am print  comments lainey fink scott grew up in a family where food was a big deal and the dish that held it was sacred most of her childhood meals were served on handmade ceramic dishes for her food is bolstered by the plate on which it is served “it enhances the dish” she said mrs scott  is a graphic designer partnering with her husband ben scott to form bluerock design she spends her days working on a computer but after the work day is over and the computers are powered down she disappears into her basement workshop where drying bowls sit upside down on a table near her throwing wheel and blocks of clay are stacked on a shelving unit her squat kiln sits off to the side upstairs her kitchen shelves are filled with plates bowls and mugs that she’s made herself restaurants in boston new york and on the vineyard also serve meals on plates and bowls she’s thrown mrs scott’s side career in ceramics began in college at the rhode island school of design when she took an introductory pottery class on a whim it was a tactile antidote to all of her computer focused graphic design classes schooled at the rhode island school of design lainey fink rekindled her passion for pottery when she moved to the vineyard three years ago — tova katzman “just being in the studio and feeling clay and mud and being dirty and not staring at a computer screen” she remembered fondly after graduation while living in boston she had no access to a studio or equipment but when the couple moved to the vineyard in  her husband pointed out that featherstone center for the arts was just a short drive from their new house mrs scott began visiting featherstone’s open pottery hours eventually she purchased her own wheel and set it up in her basement but she still had to travel back and forth to featherstone to use the kiln “i definitely had some breakage” she said referring to traveling with fragile pottery there was also the separation anxiety of leaving pieces in a building she didn’t always have access to “the thing with pottery is you have to monitor pieces” she said “they are kind of like these little babies that you have to foster each one’s life” she purchased a kiln and stocked the basement with blocks of clay and drying tables in just a few months time island chef nathan gould asked her to make some pieces for the beach plum inn “i started thinking really seriously about when you plate food how it looks compared to the glaze or the shape of the bowl or plate” mrs scott said she developed a style of simple functional dishes including flatbottomed plates with a small lip sturdy beer steins and sloping vases soon with the help of instagram she was inundated with orders companies that bluerock design works for began asking for ceramics as well as high end restaurants like o ya in boston and new york and lamplighter brewing co in cambridge though she has quickly made her way into the world of professional ceramics mrs scott said she spent hundreds and hundreds of hours figuring out what styles she liked and how to turn out a consistent product “there’s a lot of loss with pottery you kind of have to play around a ton to get what you like” she said many pieces end up in a box that she offers to friends and family who visit her house “whenever my dad comes and visits he’s like ‘so can i check out the box let’s go and look’ he usually ends up taking everything” her parents have pottery of hers dating back to her time at risd other pieces not ready for sale end up on her own kitchen shelves “i keep all the stuff that i can’t sell because of imperfections or they are prototypes or they’re a little too funky so we have all the funky stuff” her cups have been also sold at behind the bookstore and vineyard decorators will soon have a selection of her work for sale as well in rediscovering pottery mrs scott developed a second career “i would be doing it anyway even if i wasn’t making money off it” she said “i don’t know i just have to” artists comments  jay dorin rhinebeck ny gret article lainey congratulations and the best to you with many continued
