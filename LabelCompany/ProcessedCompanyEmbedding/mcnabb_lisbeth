years waiting for the thing to sell or go public mcnabb  loves the startup phase the rush where an idea gets hatched a team gets built and a fledgling business takes root enlarge mcnabb jake dean “i don’t want to do the stabilizing work around years four through ” she says instead she’d rather walk away and move on to the next thing “my value creation is in spurts of two years” that modus operandi is what mcnabb was following in midfebruary with the launch of digiworks a supplier of software that helps companies keep track of all the various times customers talk to or about them online along with helping predict what products or services those clients might need in the future based on what they’ve told the company thus far she left her last startup wwlinkcom in the first quarter of  although she remains on the board that concern provides an online forum where corporate women can go for advice from both from experts and their peers on everything from changing jobs to balancing work and home life although mcnabb serves on the boards of north texas companies like tandy brands and nexstar broadcasting and has worked at big businesses like att jpmorgan chase american airlines and fritolay she holds wwlink up as her biggest achievement founded in the dark economic days of march  when funding was scarce and fear was rampant wwlink has grown to more than  registered users she says “it continues to have powerful feedback from women entrepreneurs and men who see the value proposition” she said mcnabb manages to balance her drive to succeed with a good personal manner according to marc montoya senior vice president emedia at nexstar broadcasting montoya was a businessdevelopment vice president at matchcom while mcnabb was that dating website’s chief financial officer in the middle of the last decade he says she plays by the golden rule “she is big into the karma thing she always wants to help her people succeed” montoya said “she’s the right person you want on your team i would work for her or with her any time any place that’s how much i think of the woman” timeline age  •  worked in earlystage units of companies like att and fritolay •  sodexo

surrounding big data this year its not enough to have it but rather you need to know how to drive revenue from it we are in the midst of a transition where big data is moving over to the marketing suite as chief marketing officers are looking to drive revenue generation from big data as quickly as possible so how can you look at your customer patterns to increase secondtime sales related marketing must customer data points to stop ignoring  now here are the three critical ways to get started  know your customer the basic information is in your transactional history you have a name address and specific intel on what this individual wants or needs to buy big data analytics blows out a simple transaction by showing not just how much customers have spent but what they spent it on that knowledge will likely inform their next purchase if you analyze the first one was the purchase an anomaly or part of a behavior pattern is this a firsttime purchase or is there a history you were unaware of all your customers’ interactions with your business  whether through your website or in person on the phone or through social media   provide you with data to learn more about each of
