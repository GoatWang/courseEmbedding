in a series of blows to the egoa bitcoin etf could attract lots of actionbitcoin at an alltime highis regulation of bitcoin possibleon friday march  bitcoin rose to the highest price in history when the cryptocurrency hit  against the us dollar bitcoin trading was born in  when the price was only  cents in dollar terms and the asset has come a very long way since there has been lots of debate surrounding the cryptocurrency some call it a commodity and others a currency most commodities are raw materials or hard assets that owners can hold in their hands or store for safekeeping one can only store bitcoin in a computer wallet via a computer code one of the most interesting things about bitcoin is the blockchain technology that records a chain of ownership blockchain has many applications for other assets and could revolutionize the backoffice function creating economies of scale and decreasing the cost of settling transactions across all assets the current acting chairman of the commodities futures trading commission cftc commented on blockchain or dlt distributed ledger technology in january dlt may allow market participants to manage the enormous operational transactional and capital complexities brought about by doddfrank at the same time it may provide regulators with the market visibility necessary to fulfill our mission to oversee healthy financial markets the cftc has designated bitcoin as a commodity last friday the bitcoin market faced a highly anticipated decision by another regulator the securities and exchange commission sec which ruled on a rule change that would have allowed for the creation of the first bitcoin exchangetraded fund etf gemini sought to list the etf on the nyse arca exchange the etf was the brainchild and supported by the winklevoss twins who are angel investors in gemini bitcoin holds gains after sec decision after an initial selloff as those who trade bitcoin held their collective breath and waited for the decision from the sec last friday the price of the cryptocurrency rallied to its alltime high after all an affirmative nod from the regulatory body would have opened the floodgates for investors to position in bitcoin via an etf product source as the price chart over the past few trading sessions highlights bitcoin fell to a low of  following the adverse decision from the sec a decline of  over the course of onehour last friday afternoon the sec said in their decision that they were unnerved by a market that operates on an unregulated basis largely outside of the united states they went on to tell the market that the chances for market manipulation are high in the world of bitcoin at this time there are currently two other proposals before the sec when it comes to an etf product for bitcoin but fridays decision handed another in a series of bruises to the ego of the winklevoss twins despite the decision the reasons that have caused the increase in value for bitcoin remain strong as a currency instrument bitcoin can float freely and its value comes from supply and demand for the cryptocurrency while other foreign exchange instruments are subject to controls and manipulation by governments and monetary authorities around the world bitcoin is a panglobal means of exchange tool in nations where currencies are not freely convertible like china and russia the popularity of bitcoin has soared therefore by monday just a few days after the sec handed down a decision that put an economic bullet into the twins dreams of reaching the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency market the price was right back up above the  level and trading near last weeks highs eventually there will be a market product that replicates the price action in bitcoin but the chances are that those poor winklevoss twins lost their opportunity last week it seems like everything they get involved in is a huge winner and at best they only can capture a sliver of the value another in a series of blows to the ego the winklevoss twins reached the height of their fame when they worked with mark zuckerberg at harvard to develop facebook while zuckerberg became a billionaire the poor twins settled for  million in cash and facebook stock which today is probably only worth a couple of hundred million the twins argued in a lawsuit that they were the founders of the company and their piece of the facebook pie amounts to a mere pittance when compared with zuckerbergs net worth of which is north of  billion money cannot matter much to the twins these days as a couple of hundred million is probably more than both can spend in their lifetimes but the blow to the ego from the sec decision has probably sent both into deep analysis wondering why they just cannot get anything to go their way after all facebook has been a sensation that has surpassed almost everyones wild dreams and the future bitcoin etf product will likely have a similar result a bitcoin etf could attract lots of action one of the biggest problems with bitcoin is that it is so foreign to the traditional investment community investing in bitcoin requires a certain amount of computer savvy imagination and a wallet in ones computer to store the cryptocurrency while many millennials have embraced bitcoin the nontraditional method of investing in and holding the asset has caused many seasoned investors and traders to avoid it like the plague whenever i write a piece on bitcoin i always get at least one comment asking why someone should invest in anything that is backed by nothing the other comments express the same concern cited by the sec and other regulatory bodies that manipulation is too rife in the market to make it a solid investment vehicle an etf product would go a long way towards acceptance of bitcoin as a trading sardine face it investors and speculators love volatility and if they can trade an asset that offers wide price variance and trades on a bona fide exchange it will go a long way to increasing market visibility and acceptance a bitcoin etf product will succeed once the regulators figure out a way to understand the flows in that market and the exchanges are chomping at the bit knowing that the trading volumes and fees will be huge bitcoin at an alltime high bitcoin did not fall apart in the wake of last weeks sec announcement to reject the etf product offered by the twins in fact the price action following the announcement was just another example of another higher low for bitcoin source httpwwwcoindeskcomprice as the chart dating back to march  shows the price of bitcoin has tripled and has been making higher lows and higher highs as more people around the globe embrace a currency or commodity that is simply a function of supply and demand and that transcends the forces of government in an age where citizens in western nations are rejecting decades of the status quo as exemplified by the brexit vote and election of donald trump as president of the united states the rise in popularity of bitcoin should come as no surprise moreover as individual wealth in china increases the controlled nature of the currency and exportation of wealth creates the perfect environment for bitcoin to thrive for the time being it could be a case of this weeks highs are next weeks lows for bitcoin and the sec decision has little to do with the future popularity and acceptance of the cryptocurrency is regulation of bitcoin possible regulators are struggling to get their hands around bitcoin under the pressure of exchanges that smell profits from transaction fees if the us regulators do not act fast enough it is likely that a foreign exchange in a friendlier regulatory environment will capture market share and leave the us exchanges in the dust just like the winklevoss twins the cftc was correct to label bitcoin as a commodity national interests tend to drive currencies stocks and bond prices over time which allows regulators to liaise with markets and exchanges to control and monitor flows however commodities are a different story given that production occurs in some regions of the world and consumption is ubiquitous the cftc regulates commodity prices within the united states and works with other cooperating nations to protect the markets from bad behavior however the us regulators do not have the ability to control raw material markets on a panglobal basis and they concentrate on the activity within the borders of the nation if someone in the ivory coast decided to control and manipulate the price of cocoa the regulators could not do much opec has been attempting to manipulate the price of oil for decades but it still trades actively and is regulated by the cftc when it comes to trading on the us futures market bitcoin is a commodity and regulation needs to come with the full knowledge that what happens away from us borders will be beyond the reach of regulatory bodies the sec ruling last week was short sighted in that their argument was specious commodities markets like bitcoin operate largely outside of the us and there are instances where market manipulation occurs the cftc is accustomed to regulating commodities and therefore should have the role of guiding the sec after all there are currently cocoa nysearcanib and crude oil uso and bno etf and etn products that the sec has approved for trading and there is little difference between a bitcoin etf and those products when it comes to the arguments presented by the sec the chances are that the regulatory body will eventually bite the bullet and approve an etf product for bitcoin the problem for the winklevoss twins is that they cannot catch a break they will be left on the sidelines and on the outside looking in once again watching others make fortunes

finance chuck jaffe get email alerts donât laugh off winklevoss twinsâ bitcoin etf by chuck jaffe published july    am et share commentary bitcoinbacked fund sounds odd but so did gold etfs by chuckjaffe over the years fundindustry watchers have laughed about a lot of wild investment ideas sometimes they laughed first sometimes they have gotten the last laugh so when the fund observers started laughing last week after seeing the registration papers for the winklevoss bitcoin trust â a new exchangetraded product that faces a lengthy vetting process from the us securities and exchange commission â the question was which laugh first or last will be the better one here and who will get the final guffaw shutterstockcom if the winklevoss name rings a bell that means you probably saw the movie âthe social networkâ or know enough about the origins of facebook fb  to know that cameron and tyler winklevoss â twins who attended harvard and rowed in the  olympic games in beijing â claimed that mark zuckerberg essentially stole their idea for the business the twins walked away with a settlement worth  million in cash and facebook shares worth conservatively  times more if bitcoin rings a bell then you are versed in what some people believe is the next great step in internet and global commerce a digital currency without borders or central bank run by the people who use it the value of bitcoins â today mostly used for anonymous online purchases â is determined by the marketplace whatever someone will take for them is what they are worth though their value has surged at times of international currency strife over the past two years as happened during the cyprus crisis in early  now letâs go back to the laughs for a moment industry watchers laughed when the first specialty internet fund was launched back in the late s right up until the early iterations of those funds became a huge success then those observers rushed into net funds only to see them crater they also laughed just over a decade ago at the first gold exchangetraded funds saying funds backed by hard assets were a gimmick today gold etfs combined are the worldâs fourth largest holder of gold behind only the united states germany and the international monetary fund those are two good comparisons for the winklevoss bitcoin trust early internet funds seemed unique but were really just buying businesses that had big online components to what they were doing by comparison the bitcoin trust could be looked at as just another currency fund just with the unique â some would call it imaginary â currency of the bitcoin behind it gold funds were unique because they were backed by hard assets the bitcoin fund canât do that because well bitcoins are digital but the registration papers show that the twins claim a proprietary method for storing bitcoin holdings â theyâll charge a yettobespecified management fee for maintaining this virtual storage â which would in turn make bitcoin holdings more liquid liquidity is important here because bitcoins have a volatile history in the last year alone theyâve traded between  and  mt gox the largest bitcoin exchange had them trading in the to range last week until you can cash them however that value is both speculative and ephemeral if you canât actually spend bitcoins without converting them into conventional currency one could argue that they arenât so much a currency as a form of scrip the winklevoss filing noted accurately that bitcoins have little use in realworld retail and commercial markets compared with their ârelatively large use by speculatorsâ if you canât actually spend bitcoins without converting them into conventional currency one could argue that they arenât so much a currency as a form of scrip a temporary money that has some value but that could become worthless overnight due to any number of structural economic or market conditions another oddity of the winklevoss trust is that the brothers themselves have been buying up bitcoins and their own stash may serve as the seed coins for the fund even if they truly believe in the future of bitcoin â and every interview or statement theyâve given suggests they think bitcoin is revolutionary â an investor canât help but feel that the etf is a way for them to backstop their own investment relative to reported family fortunes or the facebook settlement the brothersâ bitcoin investment â reportedly  million as of april â is small potatoes ultimately if the bitcoin trust helps people interested in the currency to access and trade it itâs a plus even if itâs not a commercial success if bitcoin proves durable and lives up to the potential its supporters say it has then the winklevoss boys will cash in big time and be heavily imitated as an investor however you probably donât want to bet on that the twins face a long uphill battle just to get this fund to market from there chances are good it will still be viewed for years as a granular niche fund â more like a fund that specializes in stocks from bulgaria than one that has mainstream applications said morningstar analyst steven pikelny âiâd say this is a total gimmick bitcoins are very illiquid and the current trading infrastructure is riddled with securityefficiency problems â¦ if you actually want exposure to bitcoins itâs probably a better idea to buy them directly and if you canât figure out how to do that you probably donât have any business owning bitcoins in the first placeâ â¢ breakingnews alerts get free email alerts the instant news breaks more from marketwatch all the companies in jeff bezosâs empire in one large chart watch out âkidsâ are making the

approval could be approved by the end of  and will be a bitcoin exchangetraded fund etf with each share representing an amount of bitcoin held by the trust currently such an investment vehicle is only available to wealthy investors through funds like the bitcoin investment trust the winklevoss etf will allow people with a brokerage account to invest in bitcoin without having to worry about the challenges of buying storing and safekeeping bitcoin read investopedias exclusive interview with tyler winklevoss proposed in  the winklevoss bitcoin trust was the first bitcoin etf to be filed with the securities and exchange commission sec but the bitcoin investment trust announced plans in early  to release an overthecounter bitcoin etf the latter is taking a different regulatory approach that does not require approval from the sec and has projected a launch in the fourth quarter of  what is an etf etf stands for exchangetraded fund and is an investment fund that tracks an index specific asset or basket of assets many aspects of the market are covered by etfs first introduced in  etfs are similar to index funds but unlike index funds etfs can be bought and sold throughout the day on the stock exchange they have low management fees sometimes as low as  background on the winklevoss twins the winklevoss twins cameron and tyler gained notoriety through their lawsuit against the menlo park califbased facebook inc nasdaqfb from which they were awarded  million in cash and  million in facebook stock in february  they rowed for the us at the  beijing olympics went on to oxford universitys business school in the uk graduating in  and then became venture capitalists in april  they claimed to own  of all bitcoin in existence on july   their company mathbased asset services filed with the sec a form s registration statement proposing the creation of a bitcoin etf called the winklevoss bitcoin trust motivations for a bitcoin etf the s filing describes shares of the etf to be easily accessible and cost efficient by offering a product that can be bought on an exchange the winklevoss bitcoin trust will allow investors to avoid the process of purchasing bitcoins on exchanges and having to handle storage the etf price will also be based on a blended bitcoin price that reflects the volumeweighted average of top exchanges from across the world whose current exchange rates can differ and some of which may be difficult for investors to access bitcoins can currently be bought on exchanges and through companies like coinbase but typically setup is required that requires the linking of a bank account and some level of identity verification furthermore secure storage of bitcoins by placing them into cold storage  that is in wallets that are kept disconnected from the internet  can be technically challenging and investors may not want to take the responsibility of handling this a bitcoin etf traded on an exchange will give investors ways to implement various investment strategies such as shorting the etf and buying it on margin brokerages may also offer the ability to buy and sell options furthermore the release of a bitcoin etf will give bitcoin exposure to the investing mainstream and add to its validity as a store of value and as a currency the winkdex an amendment to the s sec filing was filed on february   and it included an announcement of the winklevoss index or winkdex the winkdex is a price index for bitcoin from winkdexcom the index is calculated by blending the trading prices in us dollars for the top three by volume qualified bitcoin exchanges during the previous twohour period using a volumeweighted exponential moving average this proprietary formula weighs transactions proportionally by volume as well as exponentially by time to give greater weight both to the higher volume transactions and more recent transactions the top three exchanges by volume are selected from a set of five exchanges based on the volume exchanged over the previous hour period criticism some might argue the etf provides no value if one can buy and hold bitcoin on a service like coinbase without having to incur the recurring fees associated with the etf coinbase is a san fransisco califbased company backed by renowned venture capitalists such as andreessen horowitz that provides bitcoin services to consumers and merchants for a onetime fee consumers can purchase bitcoin on coinbase however a bitcoin etf will allow investors the ability to exercise different investment strategies regarding bitcoin that are not currently available in the us the bottom line the winklevoss bitcoin trust originally proposed to the sec on july   is currently working its way toward regulatory approval when approved its shares will be issued at a price arrived at through a volumeweighted average of the bitcoin price on leading bitcoin exchanges across the world anyone with access to a brokerage account will be able to purchase shares or exercise other investment strategies made available by the brokerage stocks fb trending the trump economy news and analysis announcing the top  most influential financial advisors who is

winklevoss bitcoin trust by joseph adinolfi and ryan vlastelica published mar    am et share getty images by josephadinolfi markets reporter ryanvlastelica markets reporter the securities and exchange commission on friday rejected a proposed rule change that wouldâve allowed for the creation of the first bitcoin exchangetraded fundâa decision that has followers of the worldâs largest cryptocurrency wondering what happens next in its ruling the sec said it was unnerved by the lack of regulation in a market that is largely based outside of the us and was worried about the potential for market manipulation fortunately for investors who were hoping to buy into the fund fridayâs decision wonât necessarily preclude the approval of other proposed bitcoin etfs two other companies are vying to become the first bitcoinfocused etf but what might happen next is unclear the new york stock exchange filed a proposed rule change with the sec on jan  to allow the grayscale bitcoin trust to trade on its etf exchange nyse arca the agency now has until friday sept  to issue its ruling barry silbert the chief executive officer of the digital currency group grayscaleâs parent company declined to comment on the winklevoss decision nyse arca filed another rulechange proposal to list shares of the solidx bitcoin trust another product vying to be the first bitcoin etf back in july but it is unclear what is happening and representatives for solidx couldnt be reached for comment one factor that differentiated the winklevoss proposal from its rivals was the mechanism for tracking the bitcoin price the winklevosses planned to use pricing data gleaned from gemini a digitalcurrency exchange launched in late  that commands less than  of the bitcoin market both the grayscale and solidx proposals would peg the price to the tradeblock bitcoin index grayscaleâs proposal is widely viewed as the favorite within the bitcoin community largely because shares of its trust gbtc  Â already trade overthecounter often at a premium to bitcoinâs netasset value but some have expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest at grayscale in a comment letter filed with the sec jeffrey wilcke a representative of the ethereum foundation pointed out the relationship between the grayscale trust and coindesk an online news service that covers the digitalcurrency market both grayscale and coindesk are owned by dcg wilcke couldnt be reached for comment jerry brito chief executive director of coin center a bitcoin advocacy group said the secâs concerns about regulation create a âchicken and egg problemâ âhow do we develop wellcapitalized and regulated markets in the us and europe if financial innovators arenât allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like bitcoinâ he said in an emailed statement when asked about whatâs next for bitcoin chris burniske blockchain analyst and products lead at ark invest said it is âclear that the sec still has a way to go in terms of getting comfortable with the bitcoin marketsâ bitcoin market experts said the winklevossâs could modify their proposal to address some of the agencyâs concerns but that they would need to start the process again from the beginning and that bats would need to issue a new proposed rule change which the agency would then have a maximum of  days to consider for their part the winklevoss brothers say they remain committed to bringing âcoinâ to market âwe began this journey almost four years ago and are determined to see it through we agree with the sec that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investorsâ said tyler winklevoss in an emailed statement bitcoin btcusd  Â sold off sharply after the decision with the price of a single coin losing  in a matter of minutes but it quickly bounced back and was trading down  on the day at  late friday in new york according to the coindesk bitcoin price index spencer bogart the head of research at blockchain capital said this is evidence that the etf presented âno change to bitcoinâs compelling fundamental growth storyâ âthe drivers of bitcoin demand remain as strong now as they were two months ago before the etf fervor arrivedâ he said more from

pm est blockchain technology company solidx partners has announced that it has filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for the proposed launch of the solidx bitcoin trust a new exchangetraded fund etf for traditional investors according to the companys website solidx partners provides blockchainbased software solutions relating to the indelible recording of digital records transfer of assets and identity âsolidx also has a capital markets arm that has filed a form s registration statement for a proposed launch of a bitcoin exchange traded fundâ reads a recently added paragraph the solidx press release reveals that the etf will list on nyse arca the new york stock exchange nyse market specialized in exchangetraded products etps under the ticker symbol xbtc the trust not actively managed will provide shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the us dollar price of bitcoin before expenses and liabilities of the trust as measured by the tradeblock xbx index the solidx sec filing has been covered by the financial press including the wall street journal and reuters which indicates the growing interest in bitcoin among traditional investors who want to bet on or short the price of bitcoin without going through the hassle of buying or selling the digital currency itself âthe solidx bitcoin trust will issue solidx bitcoin shares which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the trustâ states the filing âthe trustâs assets will consist of bitcoin an asset that can be transferred among parties via the internet but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency the trust will occasionally hold cash for short periods in connection with the purchase and sale of bitcoin and to pay trust expenses the shares are issued by the trust only in one or more blocks of  shares called a âbasketâ principally in exchange for cash the trust will issue and redeem shares in baskets to certain registered authorized participants shares will be offered to the public from time to time at prices that will reflect among other things the price of bitcoin and the trading price of the shares on nyse arca at the time of the offerâ nyse arca trades more than  exchangelisted securities and is ranked first in the listing and trading of etps such as etfs exchangetraded notes etns and exchangetraded vehicles etvs according to nyse arca etps are one of the fastest growing investment products in the world combining the simplicity of stocks with the diversified risk of mutual funds jerry brito executive director of coin center has analyzed the differences between the solidx bitcoin trust and the long anticipated winklevoss bitcoin trust the winklevoss twins recently filed with the sec to switch the listing of their proposed etf winklevoss bitcoin trust to bats global markets from nasdaq cnbc reported last month brito notes that the most interesting contrast between the two proposed funds is what happens if their bitcoins are lost or stolenÂ  âthe trust will not insure its bitcoinâ states the winklevoss filing on the contrary solidx has secured insurance for its bitcoin holdings âthe trust will maintain crime excess crime and excess vault risk insurance coverage underwritten by various insurance carriersâ states the solidx filing âthe purpose of the insurance is to protect shareholders against loss or theft of the trustâs bitcoin the insurance will cover loss of bitcoin by among other things theft destruction bitcoin in transit computer fraud ie hacking attack and other loss of the private keys that are necessary to access the bitcoin held by the trustâ the insurance is explained in detail in the section âthe trustâs bitcoin insuranceâ of the filing âinvestors are understandably interested in bitcoinâ says a quartz article noting that bitcoin tracker one a trust listed on the nasdaq stockholm exchange is up  percent since april  greyscale bitcoin trust which trades on the otc markets and was created by digital currency group ceo barry silbert is up  percent over the same period âsince those are on smaller exchanges they are more difficult for investors to accessâ concludes quartz in fact itâs to be expected that availability on a major stock exchange like the nyse will

hollister for the wall street journal by rob curran updated july    pm et  comments if you have an online brokerage account you can now buy shares in a fund that aims to track the price of the digital currency called bitcoin just donât expect a smooth ride bitcoin is a highly speculative investmentâthe kind most financial advisers say investors should only buy into with money they can afford to lose but some analysts think the new fund could bring the digital currency a step closer to broader acceptance by investors for that to happen the fund will have to overcome some early difficulties journal report insights from the experts read more at wsjcomwealthreport more in investing in funds  etfs investors brace for fewer winners where are the female fund managers qa on college financing cold water on a hot insurance product usstock funds rose a hair in quarter bitcoin investment trust gbtc  started trading on the otcqx market on may  under the ticker symbol gbtc it isnât technically an exchangetraded fund but itâs designed to work like one the securities and exchange commission is reviewing an application for what would be the first official bitcoin etf the winklevoss bitcoin trust  bitcoin investment trust is small with a net asset value of only  million at the end of june and only  million shares outstanding its tracking of bitcoinâs price has been inconsistent and there is a wide spread between the share price and the value of the underlying assets oh and by the end of last month the share price had fallen  from its  close on the first day of trading to  sparking interest still some analysts think the fund could prompt some speculative interest in bitcoin like the launch of gold etfs did in precious metals a decade ago gil luria an analyst with brokerage firm wedbush securities who has followed the bitcoin market since its infancy sees bitcoin investment trust as part of bitcoinâs move toward the mainstream of finance other recent signs of acceptance on wall street include the decision of the new york state department of financial services to regulate itbit trust co a small bitcoin exchange and research from goldman sachs group inc claiming a place for bitcoin in âthe future of financeâ âthe otcqx listing is also a very big step forwardâ says mr luria âit has made at least a proxy ownership stake in bitcoin available to practically every institutional and retail investorâ anyone can buy bitcoin directly but it involves headaches including the need for specialized software for secure transactions when the spdr gold shares etf launched in november  gold futures were trading at about  an ounce the popularity of the fund was part of a gold craze that saw prices quintuple over the next seven years âinvestors historically have chosen to offload the friction of buying and securing gold directly for a reasonable feeâ says cameron winklevoss one of the founders of winklevoss bitcoin trust âwe believe some investors will behave the same with regards to bitcoin and a bitcoin exchangetraded productâ bitcoin is even more volatile than gold in its speculative heyday and even trickier to buy and sell directly and the bitcoin market is far smaller and younger than the gold market was in  but there are reasons to believe bitcoin usage could increase in a recent goldman sachs survey of  millennials  said they have used do use or will use bitcoin and well over  merchants worldwide from individuals to corporations accept bitcoin for at least some payments the firm says share shortage in addition to investorsâ attitudes about the digital currency bitcoin investment trust is wrestling with some practical issues for one the fundâs shares trade at a sizable premium to the underlying assetsâ on july  thatâs because of the fundâs origins as a private trust investors in the private trust could sell their shares on the public market after a month lockup those sales began may  but shares have only become available gradually as the private investors liquidate their holdings the shortage of shares has boosted their market value the bitcoin fund has high fees by etf standards at  photo istockphotogetty images but mr luria expects nearly all of the original trust investors to sell their shares publicly by september creating what he calls a âcritical massâ of shares on the marketâor enough to bring the price of the fundâs shares more into line with prices on the bitcoin market the fund also has high fees by etf standards at  and it may soon have competition from the proposed winklevoss fund already nasdaq has launched an exchangetraded note that tracks the price of bitcoin on its stockholm exchange however investors come to view the fund some veteran money managers see it as the latest in a long line of tenuous and risky investment products âi think a bitcoin etf says as much about the popularity of etfs as it does about the popularity of bitcoinâ says eric marshall a portfolio manager for mutualfund firm hodges capital management in dallas ânow thereâs an etf for everythingâ mr curran a writer in denton texas is a regular

regulationÂ Â â¢Â Â newsÂ Â â¢Â Â regulation investors tyler and cameron winklevoss are another step closer toÂ offering the first securities and exchange commission sec regulated bitcoin investment product following a request for comment published friday last month bats proposed a rule change that would result in the listing and trading of the winklevoss bitcoin shares issued by the winklevoss bitcoin trust now in response to that request sec assistant secretary jill peterson hasÂ opened the proposal for comment from the public peterson wrote in its filing with the commission the exchange
