in stocks of companies of all sizes but primarily invests in small to mediumcapitalization namely less than  billion market capitalization united states companies that have substantial capital appreciation potential many of these companies have little or no following by the major stock brokerage firms the investment team seeks to purchase equity of businesses that are selling at what it believes are substantial discounts to prices that accurately reflect their future earnings prospects investment process pure bottomup ideas are internally generated  the investment team exploits industry experience and contacts with suppliers customers and competitors to identify companies that might be candidates for the portfolio  if a company meets most but not all of our criteria they are added to an extensive list of similar companies which are continuously monitored broadview uses five pillar analysis to determine if a company will be added to the portfolio  the five points are as

research into human testing and beyond specifically funding for cardiovascular research and product development is difficult to secure whether from the nih venture capitalists or industry but new funding models for advancing patientoriented science to the commercial sector are emerging bostonbased broadview ventures created by the leducq family trust promotes the development of technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease and stroke through direct equitybased investments it targets early stage companies seeking to fund proofofconcept for technologies that hold promise as future breakthroughs for patient care with  such investments over the last seven years broadview has considerable experience in the seedearlystage space and its investment model is

proposals for fundingkey wordscardiovascularphilanthropyventure capitalfor translational investigators in cardiovascular disease and stroke securing funds to move preclinical stage research into human testing and beyond remains a challenge this “translational funding gap” is widening and although many claim to fund early stage work the data and experience of entrepreneurs in academia and elsewhere prove differently figure   despite recent increases in funding for translational research the national institutes of health primarily supports basic discovery research and has experienced significant budget pressure over the past years indeed cardiovascular and stroke research continue to be relatively underfunded with respect to their impact on global health—as compared with cancer for example —and foundations and charitable organizations such as the american heart association can only make up some of this difference figure  in industry over the last decade spending on research and development has remained unchanged whereas the cost to bring new drugs and devices to market is increasing making access to industry funding by independent clinical investigators more difficult and the percentage of venture capital funding directed toward startupseed investments is diminishing—with venture capital preferring to fund laterstage lowerrisk product development activities figure

broadview ventures was designed to promote the development of technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease and stroke through direct equitybased investments cash in exchange for equity position it targets earlystage companies seeking to fund proof of concept for technologies that hold promise as future breakthroughs for patient care with  such investments over the last  years broadview has considerable experience in the seedearlystage space and its investment model is demonstrating early signs of successhistory leducq foundation and broadview venturesthe mission and structure of broadview ventures can be traced to the leducq foundation and its supporting trust created in  by french entrepreneur and industrialist jean leducq together with his wife sylviane motivated by a multigenerational family history of cardiovascular illness and inspired to work at the international level through years of living and working abroad the leducqs used the proceeds of the sale of the family’s multinational linen and uniform services businesses to establish a foundation for cardiovascular research with a mission to improve human health through international efforts to combat cardiovascular and neurovascular disease the foundation’s signature program the transatlantic networks of excellence in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease supports international networks of experts in cardiovascular disease and stroke that work collaboratively to advance scientific knowledge bring new technology to patient care and help to train early career investigators since making its first award in  the foundation has committed over  million to cardiovascular and neurovascular research supporting  research networks at  institutions in  countriesfrom the outset the leducq organization was interested in promoting the technology that was developed through the research it supported the board of the leducq family trust soon determined that the best way to accomplish this objective was to create an independent organization dedicated solely to promoting and investing in technology in  it decided to create broadview ventures specifically addressing the translational gap by providing seed and earlystage funding for companies on the path to developing commercial products for patients with cardiovascular and neurovascular disease broadview shares a mission in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease with the leducq foundation but proceeds through a direct investment model whereas the foundation works through a more traditional grant programbroadview is purposefully structured as a forprofit venture capital firm so that it can interact on equal ground with likeminded venture capitalists and corporate partners that have financial return on investment as a primary goal that said broadview is mission not profitdriven and defines success through social impact and improving patient care its mission orientation allows broadview to invest in important areas that others may see as less interesting due to market size or risk issues eg pediatrics the sole shareholder of broadview is the leducq family trust which can manage both the risk and longterm capital commitments associated with earlystage investing broadview is structured as an evergreen fund and all generated profits are used for additional early stage investments or to support activities of the leducq foundationbroadview activityin sourcing investments broadview defines cardiovascular disease broadly in addition to investing in the core therapeutic areas within cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction heart failure arrhythmias and valvular disease broadview is also interested in underlying pathways such as inflammation and atherogenesis predisposing factors such as hypertension and comorbidities such as cardiorenal and cardiopulmonary conditions type  diabetes obesity and dyslipidemia as cardiovascular risk factors are also considered to fall within the scope of the mission stroke is the primary indication within broadview’s neurovascular focusthe investments made thus far by broadview include microrna stem cell and gene therapies nonsurgical and minimally invasive delivery techniques for valves and devices and mechanical and pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation hypertension stroke diabetes and obesity figure  broadview invests in all

the technology must have adequate intellectual property protection and a clear ability to influence patient therapy andor standard of care the proposed use of funds must be well defined with quantifiable and achievable milestones and there must be a clear understanding of future funding requirements to bring the technology through clinical development to marketbroadview is fortunate to be guided by a worldclass strategic advisory board composed of thought leaders from academia finance and industry figure  it also has access to a network of cardiovascular and neurovascular medicine experts developed over the years via the leducq foundation broadview utilizes these relationships for deal sourcing diligence investment counsel clinical development advice and portfolio company

deal sourcing diligence and the investment process after investment the broadview team plays an active role via board participation offering longterm support throughout the life of its portfolio companiescase studyalthough improving patient care is its main goal broadview also hopes to share its learning and experiences with other family offices and venture philanthropic investors although still evolving as a fund broadview has seen some early signs of success most notably the recent acquisition by edwards lifesciences of cardiaq valve technologies a company funded by broadview that is focused on developing a percutaneous mitral valve technologythe cardiaq story demonstrates the many steps layers of funding and expertise and persistence necessary for successful early stage investing in  broadview was connected with a surgeon and business executive both working in their spare hours to develop a percutaneous mitral valve implantation device later that year after a significant level of diligence and review by its strategic advisory board broadview made a  seed investment in cardiaq to develop a device prototype and conduct early animal testing this investment attracted additional corporate and board leadership from within the valve industry and led to a m series a financing round in  in which broadview also participated the company established stateoftheart facilities in irvine california and successfully completed the firstever transcatheter mitral valve replacement in a porcine model in  the company conducted successful firstinhuman implantation of the valve in europe this milestone attracted a large series b financing round with participation by several large wellknown venture capital investors orbimed invus versant and advent with this funding a secondgeneration device was developed and successfully implanted in several more patients in august of  edwards lifesciences acquired cardiaq valve technologies for  million figure download figure open in new tab download powerpoint figure  cardiaq valve technologies from idea to firstinmanceo  chief executive officer cvt  cardiaq valve technologiesalthough the financial return on investment was positive for all involved most important to broadview is that the technology through edwards’ market leadership and extensive resources will now move to largescale clinical trials for regulatory approval—and hopefully become a commercial product that will improve the lives of patients with mitral valve disease in addition the investment story demonstrates that missionrelated philanthropicbased funds can be deployed at an early stage to help science cross the translational gap to move through the clinical development pathwayfor every dollar invested by broadview its portfolio companies have raised seven additional dollars in coinvestments followon funding and grants this additional funding has enabled smaller “surrogate markers of success” that demonstrate daytoday progress at broadview’s portfolio companies—such as movement from preclinical work to firstin human trials achievement of regulatory approval for products and a successful european product launch in addition many of broadview portfolio companies have developed relationships with strategic investors and industry partners to support movement toward commercial product approvalthe futurethe leadership vision and resources of the leducq family trust have been critical to the ability of broadview to look past the near term for highrisk–highreward longerterm solutions to today’s pressing problems in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease with earlystage investing in the life sciences comes acceptance that the road for the fund and its portfolio companies will be challenging there will be many failures to get to far fewer successes importantly however this work remains consistent with the vision and values of the founders whose bequest will ensure that the foundation and broadview remain true to their mission in cardiovascular and neurovascular science and will have the resources to continue the good work that started with the leducq foundation  years agobroadview
