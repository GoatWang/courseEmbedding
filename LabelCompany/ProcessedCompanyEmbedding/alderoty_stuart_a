university of florida httpwwwprogressivecattlecomtopicsfeednutritiondoyourcattlegetenoughvitamindviqcjlrzqemail   this article recently appeared in the october  issue of progressive cattleman  dr nelson reviews recent information on the need for vitamin d supplementation in beef cows and calves  for newborn beef calves dr nelson recommends an injectable source of vitamin d at birth to build up vitamin d stores in the calf  in the article dr nelson wrote “even though the springtime sun will stimulate vitamin d production in their skin it takes a couple of months to reach adequacy  based on experiments i have done  iu vitamin d injected at birth will boost serum hydroxyvitamin d of calves to near  ng per ml”  dr nelson recommends products that contain at least  iu vitamin d per ml of product besides vitamin d vital enewborn from stuart products inc also provides vitamin e and vitamin a for the newborn calf  each ml contains  iu vitamin e  iu vitamin a and  iu vitamin d that has been proven to be biologically available to the calf  inject newborn calves with  ml at birth  for more information please contact us       posters presented at  joint annual meeting wednesday  july   posters presented at  joint annual meeting of the american dairy science association® adsa® the american society of animal science asas and the canadian society of animal science csas response of newborn calves to injectable vitamins a d and eabstract number   jam differences in formulation and bioavailability of commercial injectable fatsoluble vitamin productsabstract number   jam   friday  july   rationale for emcelle®ed liquid in drinking water for weaned pigs fatsoluble vitamins a d and e are each metabolized differently by pigs fatsoluble vitamin status in pigs is very complex because metabolism of each fatsoluble vitamin is different in the pig  pigs have a dietary requirement for vitamin a and vitamin e since neither can be produced in the body while vitamin d can be produced in pigs that have adequate access to sunlight  without adequate sunlight vitamin d would then be required in the pig’s diet   while nursing pig’s vitamin e and vitamin a status are usually adequate however vitamin d status is usually low due to low levels in sow’s milk  what is interesting is that vitamin e status goes down very quickly after weaning because of lack of body stores pigs’ vitamin d status continues to be very low and vitamin a status is not impacted by weaning since vitamin a is stored in the liver   weaned pigs can not utilize feedgrade vitamin e university and field studies have shown that newlyweaned pigs  click here to read more         increase in vitamin e and a in ovaries of gilts after injection of vital e®repro below is a recent “news to use” on the impact
