review events talk log in     w th stsan pedro ca    i have been a patient of dr schmidt for  years he is an excellent doctor who deeply cares for his patients some have stated long wait times as a problem however i look at it as the reality it is when he walks into the examination room you are who matters he does this for every patient his focus is on you and when you leave you have your care plan established with drawings if necessary you leave knowing youre going to be okay because dr schmidt is taking care of you as for his support staff they are wonderful i feel privileged and lucky to have found a doctor and individuals like mena who i feel very comfortable with and care about as if they are family in fact i commute to and from big bear for appointments after leaving the area i cant envision ever having another doctor dr schmidt is the real deal ive been seeing him since  for some mundane and some scary stuff he is highly skilled confident and compassionate in todays in  out service arena a lot is lost in medical care excellent diagnosis and treatment takes time some of which needs to be discovered with conversation about you dr s takes the time and his first question is how are you not what insurance do you have his office is usually busy but with several generations of perdo patients who know the well kept secret of his mature responsible and nurturing care his staff is busy but professional if something is urgent but not an emergency talk to them they wont move you to to first in line but will certainly work you in with reason not a  month out appointment yeah you have to wait some times but i dont want an in  out burger i want a filet david l  san pedro unfortunately i was never able to see the dr he must have a booming business and upholds his reputation it is a shame that his office manager mena doesnt practice a similar attention to detail and precision that almost all of the reviews rave on about dr schmidt due to a  minute wait and a very intolerant mena explaining it would be another houri will never know how great dr schmidt is and that was with an appointment i guess new patients arent as valuable as old ones the lack of communication from office staff to patients and the disregard for somebodys time and medical issues are unacceptable not to detail the unprofessionalism and lack of respect towards a patient i am disappointed in mena specifically for lack of patience and poor customer service dr schmidt may be great from what i read however the face of his establishment has definitely deemed herself incapable of providing adequate care mena should not work with the general public and definitely avoid any patient interactions it is sad that she is having her family members post on yelp the truth comes from the client not your cousin ive been a long time patient of dr schmidts not only is dr schmidt the best doctor in town  but his staff is wonderful yes there is a long wait but dr takes his time when its your turn mena is very professional and helpful and not in anyway rude mena has always gone above and beyond to help and accommodate patients and we miss bridget she was always so lovely and helpful as well the review below written by chris is exactly on point the front staff is awful i switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff dr schmidt is a good doctor great actually however his staff must all be temps make an appointment yeah you can but youll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then  more minutes in the back the staff did not inform me i would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary so i show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after i signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago i was told it was a printing issue yeah thats lovely you should then inform the patient very rude on the phone as well if you value your time and accuracy from the office regarding your records go to another office worst experience ever from a doctors office if you value your time this isnt the dr you want to see appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at least  hours no joke and there isnt even a tv nor a radio in the waiting room the dr does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait however ive had a problem arise that he couldnt fix and didnt refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late ive been tolerant here because i do like the staff but this is what did it for me its approximately  degrees today and the office doesnt have any water now that is a joke an elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office that includes the back as well did not have clean water for her to drink excellent doctor that takes his time to know his patients he has never failed me whenever i needed him he is also a good person in general and treats people like human beings you can tell he really does care about his patients and what he does dr schmidt is a great physician and yes you have to wait thats just the way it is please dont let shannons review define dr schmidt or mena office staff as they are both quite pleasant professional and knowledgeable about their jobs i have been dr schmidts patient for over  years and today i was squeezed in without an appointment because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer yes shannon this was most likely on your time during your appointment as you were there before me with an appointment i am sorry i made you wait  how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business shame on my breast mena had nothing to do with me being seen during your time anyhow while i was lying on the examining table waiting for dr schmidt and contemplating life and who was going to raise my  yr old daughter i hear this woman ranting and raving how disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner i couldnt believe that anyone would talk to medical staff this way when timing has nothing to do with the office staff but rather the dr who is seeing patients what you didnt know shannon was that a few patients me included were watching and listening with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint mena showed shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and i felt terrible for mena that she couldnt just ask you to leave and took your abuse yes shannon i saw it as well as other patients who also heard it last but not least you called her a  person  times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet and my heart broke for her how dare you after you snatched the paperwork from menas hand demanded her name and swung the door open wildly i walked to the office area in my gown and hugged mena i told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved anyone who knows mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best so my review is two fold take reviews with a grain of salt and to new patients please come meet one of san pedros finest doctors and great staff shannon i am not a doctor but you need meds all of these reviews are bs if you see any doctor there will be a wait the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is busy i saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation i feel like every doctors office ive been to ive waited an hour after my appointment because hes doing his job i have great respect for dr schmidt and the nurses ive been seeing dr schmidt for eight years he is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body his staff is really nice yes there is always a wait yes i make an appointment and then call ahead they call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you dont have to wait in the waiting room yes there is usually a wait of about  minutes once you get there but once you are in the room with him you have his complete undivided attention that is what makes dr schmidt amazing he cares and takes his time i feel that high quality care is worth the wait i refer everyone i know to him i think hes the best doctor in san pedro i love dr schmidt he is the real dealan old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate updated and evidence based treatments he respects his patients and treats them like if his own family dr schmidt has patients that have been with him for over  yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again he is a true healer who he really cares but caring requires listening which takes time so be prepared to wait your turn dr schmidt does not practice fast food medicine go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in  minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others i will continue to happily see dr s and wait my turn because i know despite the wait i will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest i wont have to worry that i will be herded in and out like cattle simply there to meet some detached providers quota for the day which is so common i am very unimpressed with drschmidts practice we had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if theyre ready for you i call and leave a voicemail including the reason name and phone number to reach me back at never got a call called again later in the day still no answer i call first thing the next day and the response was to keep calling until someone picks up no that is not my job i am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up anyways they invite us over in the morning to get my alzheimerridden grandmothers appointment out of the way they call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if i was the one who accompanied my grandmother telling me that she left twenty minutes ago can you imagine you go to a doctors office and theyre so ignorant irresponsible and incapable to let an alzheimers patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together do not i repeat do not go here do not go here if you want proper treatment a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable unfortunately ive wasted the past  years of my health at this poor establishment fortunately when i went to a qualified doctor i wasnt given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people i know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care in addition ive never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an overconfident underqualified nonhumorous individual the office staff is subpar and lacks professionalism they are incapable of properly communicating as adults the interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job the interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe this is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesnt offer the same service anymore nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility i have been dr schmidts patient for about one year and i have never had a chance to meet with him i was only helped by a nurse practitioner the office staff are not friendly i have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me ini am looking for a better dr in my area i do not recommend this dr schmidt to any one i could not be happier with the service  care i recieved from dr schmidt  his staff i would definitely find a doctor other than dr schmidt i arrived on time for my  appointment after waiting with many others in the waiting area i was finally let into a room at  yes one hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area once inside one of the patient rooms i thought i would be promptly seen however it was about  when the np came in for my appointment this doctors office needs to be more considerate to its patients there are just too many other doctors out there to choose from i will be looking for another one myself dr schmidt is our primary care physician i swear ive probably been there about  times now and ive met the man once youre pretty much in the care of the nurses assistants and physicans assistant dont bother making an appointment bc youll never be seen on time prepare to wait at least an additional  minutes the waiting room can get quite full even if youre the first appointment of the day youll be seen about  minutes after the fact but thats still way better than the midmornings and afternoons parking is a pain bc there is no direct access from the lot youll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself street parking is accessible but never available the reason for the extra star is for the receptionist nancy she is great very understanding attentive and will go out of her way to make you happy be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient you can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long theyve been there and some were there for  hours a fellow staff memberpatient waited over  hours the majority of the problems i had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits my insurance card was left in the copier and i had to return to the office to retrieve it when i went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me not only was it left in the copier but it was never actually copied i learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record i was given a referral phone number for a specialist and the phone number was inaccurate on one visit none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time if youre one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor hes a very nice individual the front office staff are relatively friendly as well i just wish i wasnt nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of bottom line if i was asked to recommend this office i would be hesitant health care in this day and age is confusing it is important when you do see a dr that they have your best interest at heart and dr schmidt does and he will be your advocate regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible dr schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can he cares about his patients i have seen him when i am not feeling well he is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out he made sure i was happy with the referrals he gave he takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year and follows up to make sure youre recovering i have also been there when i am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time i suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand dr schmidt is ok but his staff is generally terrible nancy may be ok but many of the others are cranky make mistakes etc it can take weeks to get an appointment when you finally get one the wait is terrible years ago you could see him or his partner on a saturday or a wednesday night now hes solo he does not have wednesday night or saturday appointments and i think hes actually there twice a week at best they have messed up appointments records and once the nurse  gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive my husband got nervous and just told them to forget it and he left i checked with the cdc later and that nurse did not know what she was talking about would she have given my husband the wrong injection yikes then they charged someone elses appointment to my husbands insurance i say switch to his former partners group dr jimenezteam on st

talk log in     w th stsan pedro ca    i have been a patient of dr schmidt for  years he is an excellent doctor who deeply cares for his patients some have stated long wait times as a problem however i look at it as the reality it is when he walks into the examination room you are who matters he does this for every patient his focus is on you and when you leave you have your care plan established with drawings if necessary you leave knowing youre going to be okay because dr schmidt is taking care of you as for his support staff they are wonderful i feel privileged and lucky to have found a doctor and individuals like mena who i feel very comfortable with and care about as if they are family in fact i commute to and from big bear for appointments after leaving the area i cant envision ever having another doctor dr schmidt is the real deal ive been seeing him since  for some mundane and some scary stuff he is highly skilled confident and compassionate in todays in  out service arena a lot is lost in medical care excellent diagnosis and treatment takes time some of which needs to be discovered with conversation about you dr s takes the time and his first question is how are you not what insurance do you have his office is usually busy but with several generations of perdo patients who know the well kept secret of his mature responsible and nurturing care his staff is busy but professional if something is urgent but not an emergency talk to them they wont move you to to first in line but will certainly work you in with reason not a  month out appointment yeah you have to wait some times but i dont want an in  out burger i want a filet david l  san pedro unfortunately i was never able to see the dr he must have a booming business and upholds his reputation it is a shame that his office manager mena doesnt practice a similar attention to detail and precision that almost all of the reviews rave on about dr schmidt due to a  minute wait and a very intolerant mena explaining it would be another houri will never know how great dr schmidt is and that was with an appointment i guess new patients arent as valuable as old ones the lack of communication from office staff to patients and the disregard for somebodys time and medical issues are unacceptable not to detail the unprofessionalism and lack of respect towards a patient i am disappointed in mena specifically for lack of patience and poor customer service dr schmidt may be great from what i read however the face of his establishment has definitely deemed herself incapable of providing adequate care mena should not work with the general public and definitely avoid any patient interactions it is sad that she is having her family members post on yelp the truth comes from the client not your cousin ive been a long time patient of dr schmidts not only is dr schmidt the best doctor in town  but his staff is wonderful yes there is a long wait but dr takes his time when its your turn mena is very professional and helpful and not in anyway rude mena has always gone above and beyond to help and accommodate patients and we miss bridget she was always so lovely and helpful as well the review below written by chris is exactly on point the front staff is awful i switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff dr schmidt is a good doctor great actually however his staff must all be temps make an appointment yeah you can but youll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then  more minutes in the back the staff did not inform me i would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary so i show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after i signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago i was told it was a printing issue yeah thats lovely you should then inform the patient very rude on the phone as well if you value your time and accuracy from the office regarding your records go to another office worst experience ever from a doctors office if you value your time this isnt the dr you want to see appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at least  hours no joke and there isnt even a tv nor a radio in the waiting room the dr does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait however ive had a problem arise that he couldnt fix and didnt refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late ive been tolerant here because i do like the staff but this is what did it for me its approximately  degrees today and the office doesnt have any water now that is a joke an elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office that includes the back as well did not have clean water for her to drink excellent doctor that takes his time to know his patients he has never failed me whenever i needed him he is also a good person in general and treats people like human beings you can tell he really does care about his patients and what he does dr schmidt is a great physician and yes you have to wait thats just the way it is please dont let shannons review define dr schmidt or mena office staff as they are both quite pleasant professional and knowledgeable about their jobs i have been dr schmidts patient for over  years and today i was squeezed in without an appointment because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer yes shannon this was most likely on your time during your appointment as you were there before me with an appointment i am sorry i made you wait  how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business shame on my breast mena had nothing to do with me being seen during your time anyhow while i was lying on the examining table waiting for dr schmidt and contemplating life and who was going to raise my  yr old daughter i hear this woman ranting and raving how disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner i couldnt believe that anyone would talk to medical staff this way when timing has nothing to do with the office staff but rather the dr who is seeing patients what you didnt know shannon was that a few patients me included were watching and listening with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint mena showed shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and i felt terrible for mena that she couldnt just ask you to leave and took your abuse yes shannon i saw it as well as other patients who also heard it last but not least you called her a  person  times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet and my heart broke for her how dare you after you snatched the paperwork from menas hand demanded her name and swung the door open wildly i walked to the office area in my gown and hugged mena i told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved anyone who knows mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best so my review is two fold take reviews with a grain of salt and to new patients please come meet one of san pedros finest doctors and great staff shannon i am not a doctor but you need meds all of these reviews are bs if you see any doctor there will be a wait the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is busy i saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation i feel like every doctors office ive been to ive waited an hour after my appointment because hes doing his job i have great respect for dr schmidt and the nurses ive been seeing dr schmidt for eight years he is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body his staff is really nice yes there is always a wait yes i make an appointment and then call ahead they call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you dont have to wait in the waiting room yes there is usually a wait of about  minutes once you get there but once you are in the room with him you have his complete undivided attention that is what makes dr schmidt amazing he cares and takes his time i feel that high quality care is worth the wait i refer everyone i know to him i think hes the best doctor in san pedro i love dr schmidt he is the real dealan old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate updated and evidence based treatments he respects his patients and treats them like if his own family dr schmidt has patients that have been with him for over  yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again he is a true healer who he really cares but caring requires listening which takes time so be prepared to wait your turn dr schmidt does not practice fast food medicine go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in  minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others i will continue to happily see dr s and wait my turn because i know despite the wait i will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest i wont have to worry that i will be herded in and out like cattle simply there to meet some detached providers quota for the day which is so common i am very unimpressed with drschmidts practice we had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if theyre ready for you i call and leave a voicemail including the reason name and phone number to reach me back at never got a call called again later in the day still no answer i call first thing the next day and the response was to keep calling until someone picks up no that is not my job i am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up anyways they invite us over in the morning to get my alzheimerridden grandmothers appointment out of the way they call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if i was the one who accompanied my grandmother telling me that she left twenty minutes ago can you imagine you go to a doctors office and theyre so ignorant irresponsible and incapable to let an alzheimers patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together do not i repeat do not go here do not go here if you want proper treatment a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable unfortunately ive wasted the past  years of my health at this poor establishment fortunately when i went to a qualified doctor i wasnt given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people i know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care in addition ive never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an overconfident underqualified nonhumorous individual the office staff is subpar and lacks professionalism they are incapable of properly communicating as adults the interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job the interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe this is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesnt offer the same service anymore nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility i have been dr schmidts patient for about one year and i have never had a chance to meet with him i was only helped by a nurse practitioner the office staff are not friendly i have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me ini am looking for a better dr in my area i do not recommend this dr schmidt to any one i could not be happier with the service  care i recieved from dr schmidt  his staff i would definitely find a doctor other than dr schmidt i arrived on time for my  appointment after waiting with many others in the waiting area i was finally let into a room at  yes one hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area once inside one of the patient rooms i thought i would be promptly seen however it was about  when the np came in for my appointment this doctors office needs to be more considerate to its patients there are just too many other doctors out there to choose from i will be looking for another one myself dr schmidt is our primary care physician i swear ive probably been there about  times now and ive met the man once youre pretty much in the care of the nurses assistants and physicans assistant dont bother making an appointment bc youll never be seen on time prepare to wait at least an additional  minutes the waiting room can get quite full even if youre the first appointment of the day youll be seen about  minutes after the fact but thats still way better than the midmornings and afternoons parking is a pain bc there is no direct access from the lot youll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself street parking is accessible but never available the reason for the extra star is for the receptionist nancy she is great very understanding attentive and will go out of her way to make you happy be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient you can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long theyve been there and some were there for  hours a fellow staff memberpatient waited over  hours the majority of the problems i had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits my insurance card was left in the copier and i had to return to the office to retrieve it when i went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me not only was it left in the copier but it was never actually copied i learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record i was given a referral phone number for a specialist and the phone number was inaccurate on one visit none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time if youre one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor hes a very nice individual the front office staff are relatively friendly as well i just wish i wasnt nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of bottom line if i was asked to recommend this office i would be hesitant health care in this day and age is confusing it is important when you do see a dr that they have your best interest at heart and dr schmidt does and he will be your advocate regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible dr schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can he cares about his patients i have seen him when i am not feeling well he is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out he made sure i was happy with the referrals he gave he takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year and follows up to make sure youre recovering i have also been there when i am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time i suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand dr schmidt is ok but his staff is generally terrible nancy may be ok but many of the others are cranky make mistakes etc it can take weeks to get an appointment when you finally get one the wait is terrible years ago you could see him or his partner on a saturday or a wednesday night now hes solo he does not have wednesday night or saturday appointments and i think hes actually there twice a week at best they have messed up appointments records and once the nurse  gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive my husband got nervous and just told them to forget it and he left i checked with the cdc later and that nurse did not know what she was talking about would she have given my husband the wrong injection yikes then they charged someone elses appointment to my husbands insurance i say switch to his former partners group dr jimenezteam on st  western who never makes you wait

here because i do like the staff but this is what did it for me its approximately  degrees today and the office doesnt have any water now that is a joke an elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office that includes the back as well did not have clean water for her to drink was this review … useful  funny  cool sara s san pedro ca  friends  reviews share review

share review embed review compliment send message follow maria m stop following maria m  dr schmidt is a great physician and yes you have to wait thats just the way it is  please dont let shannons review define dr schmidt or mena office staff as they are both quite pleasant professional and knowledgeable about their jobs  i have been dr schmidts patient for over  years and today i was squeezed  in without an appointment  because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer   yes shannon this was most likely on your time during your appointment as you were there before me with an appointment  i am sorry i made you wait  how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business shame on my breast   mena had nothing to do with me being seen during your time  anyhow while i was  lying on the examining table waiting for dr schmidt and contemplating life and who was going to raise my  yr old daughter  i hear this woman ranting and raving how disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner   i  couldnt believe that anyone would talk to  medical staff this way when timing has nothing to do with the office staff but rather the dr who is seeing patients  what you didnt know shannon was that a few patients me included were watching and listening with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint mena showed shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and i felt terrible for mena that she couldnt just ask you to leave and took your abuse   yes shannon i saw it as well as other patients who also heard it  last but not least you called her a  person  times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet and my heart broke for her   how dare you after you snatched the paperwork from menas hand  demanded her name and swung the door open wildly i walked to the office area in my gown and hugged mena i told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved  anyone who knows mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best  so my review is two fold take reviews with a grain of salt and to new patients please come meet one of san pedros finest doctors and great staff  shannon i am not a doctor but you need meds was this review … useful  funny  cool  eva s san pedro ca  friends  reviews  photos share review

staff is really nice  yes there is always a wait  yes i make an appointment and then call ahead  they call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you dont have to wait in the waiting room  yes there is usually a wait of about  minutes once you get there  but once you are in the room with him you have his complete undivided attention  that is what makes dr schmidt amazing  he cares and takes his time  i feel that high quality care is worth the wait  i refer everyone i know to him  i think hes the best doctor in san  pedro was this review … useful funny cool  l l los angeles ca  friends

your turn dr schmidt does not practice fast food medicine go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in  minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others i will continue to happily see dr s and wait my turn because i know despite the wait i will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest i wont have to worry that i will be herded in and out like cattle simply there to meet some detached providers quota for the day which is so common was this review … useful  funny cool ava a cambria ca  friends  reviews share review

still no answer i call first thing the next day and the response was to keep calling until someone picks up no that is not my job i am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up anyways they invite us over in the morning to get my alzheimerridden grandmothers appointment out of the way they call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if i was the one who accompanied my grandmother telling me that she left twenty minutes ago can you imagine you go to a doctors

treatment a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable unfortunately ive wasted the past  years of my health at this poor establishment fortunately when i went to a qualified doctor i wasnt given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people i know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care in addition ive never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an overconfident underqualified nonhumorous individual the office staff is subpar and lacks professionalism they are incapable of properly communicating as adults the interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job the interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe this is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesnt offer the same service anymore nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility was this review … useful  funny  cool

 first to review dr schmidt is our primary care physician i swear ive probably been there about  times now and ive met the man once youre pretty much in the care of the nurses assistants and physicans assistant dont bother making an appointment bc youll never be seen on time prepare to wait at least an additional  minutes the waiting room can get quite full even if youre the first appointment of the day youll be seen about  minutes after the fact but thats still way better than the midmornings and afternoons parking is a pain bc there is no direct access from the lot youll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself street parking is accessible but never available the reason for the extra star is for the receptionist nancy she is great very understanding attentive and will go out of her way to make you happy was this review … useful  funny  cool  steve g long beach ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow steve g stop following steve g  be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient you can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long theyve been there and some were there for  hours a fellow staff memberpatient waited over  hours the majority of the problems i had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits my insurance card was left in the copier and i had to return to the office to retrieve it when i went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me not only was it left in the copier but it was never actually copied i learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record i was given a referral phone number for a specialist and the phone number was inaccurate on one visit none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time if youre one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor hes a very nice individual the front office staff are relatively friendly as well i just wish i wasnt nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care ofbottom line if i was asked to recommend this office i would be hesitant was this review … useful  funny  cool  bonnie w san pedro ca  friends  reviews

interest at heart and dr schmidt does and he will be your advocate  regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible dr schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can he cares about his patients i have seen him when i am not feeling well he is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out he made sure i was happy with the referrals he gave he takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year and follows up to make sure youre recovering  i have also been there when i am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time i suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead
