weasel of a word whose meanings slip and slide they always have not that one should use modernism and always in the same sentence nobody talked or thought about modernism in the middle ages  the idea of a battle between new and established cultural forms was not an issue then now it has gone completely the other way nobody or nobody with brains assigns a missionary role to culture the work of art is just one more consumer product among others modernism is something old that we look back on not without nostalgia its ashtrays and dinner sets the chrometubeandleatherstrap marcel breuer chairs get revived and recirculated without comment the idea of modernism connotes some kind of ideal and even quasiofficial mindset seen in one light it even suggests too much solidity think of how the innumerable descendants and clones of mies van der rohe created in their high bland cliffs of steel and glass the face of american corporate capitalism that certainly wasnt the modernité charles baudelaire was thinking of in  when in the painter of modern life he described modernity as an exaltation of the ephemeral the fugitive the contingent the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable nor was it what jonathan swift complained of in a letter to alexander pope  the work of english scribblers who send us over their trash in prose and verse with abominable curtailings and quaint modernisms that was in  and was the first and probably the last time that modernism and quaintness were linked in the same sentence the essence of modernism to the early th century when its lessons really began to catch on would be that it was antiquaint clear clean stripped as a piston dealing only in essentials but by quaint swift meant something more like bizarre  he wasnt thinking of picturesqueness once movements and works that no longer seem to match up with modernism as we understand it used to call themselves modernist in barcelona the modernists were architects like josep puig i cadafalch lluís domènech i montaner and even antoni gaudi all of whose work fairly groaned beneath the weight of its historical references exuberant natural detail and symbolic narratives  the very opposite of what people at the bauhaus were thinking about would you call a concerthouse ceiling encrusted with giant polychrome pottery roses each the size of a cabbage modernist but that was what domenech the star of catalan modernism did in his masterpiece the palace of catalan music a building almost unimaginably remote from the products and ideas of northern modernist architects and theorists like walter gropius and le corbusier who wanted to strip all ornament from buildings and like euclid look on beauty bare adolf loos in vienna actually wrote a polemical text entitled ornament and crime in which he set forth the truly demented thesis that the impulse to decorate any shape or surface was in itself degenerate characteristic of the bestial primitive ornament was excrement in the imagination of such people  mercilessly satirised by evelyn waugh in the character of the mad modernist architect professor silenus read gropius in decline and fall  the only worthwhile culture in the s was machine culture made of the shapes that machines could make with no caressing handwork every form repeatable at will no noodles van de rohe one of the heroes of the style used to say in  paris lart moderne was not machine culture at all it was organic luscious and hysterically decorative  what we now call art nouveau whose twining whiplash curves or noodles were the polar opposite of machine metaphors but gradually the meaning of modernism settled down to its present form based on utopian fancies standardisation industrial materials like chrome and plate glass abstraction and a vehement ambition to make a new world not just a new art design  the rethinking from zero on up of everything from teapots to whole cities  was imagined as potentially allpowerful and this is the impulse to which the forthcoming show at the va in london modernism designing a new world  is dedicated its no accident that the exhibitions delimiting years should be the starting dates of two catastrophic world wars  and  these dates mark the span of a hectic utopian hope among europeans who felt  as apollinaire wrote in his great paean to cultural renewal in the end you are tired of this old world the hope of renewal took form in the rubble of postfirst world war germany and attained something like hysteria in the wake of the bolshevik revolution in broad terms it said things cant get worse than this you cant take the elements of pre visual culture and put them like humpty dumpty together again just as they were before the corpse will not rise and speak we therefore as intellectuals and artists can make one of three choices either we throw out the vestiges of culture all of them dream romantic dreams of blank slates reject everything that makes claim to humane and rational discourse all that our parents called adult and call ourselves dadaists the name dada parodied a childs first utterance it was meant to symbolise the act of beginning again from nothing having rejected the past in all its weighty totality  a cultural impossibility but at least a challenge for disoriented selfmade radicals in  or we put our bets on transferring fantasies about the future back into the present make enormously inflated claims about a technological millennium that hasnt arrived and isnt likely to appear just yet and call ourselves futurists a rhetorical stratagem that works best among the whimsical and operatic italians or else we say that europe dire as its condition is can actually be improved so we must invent a new environment of buildings cities images and tools whose end will be to create new societies of men and women this engineering will get a name modernism it will be buoyed up by an immense and irrational hope shared as cultural movements tend to be by a small number of likeminded people who only have the haziest notion of and generally rather despise what the majorities around them want in russia particularly this hope attained an absurdity worthy of the inventors isle of laputa as imagined by swift one inventor georgii krutikov put out an idea for a flying city kept in the air by electrical currents  this at a time when there was hardly enough surplus wattage in all of moscow to run an egg timer another anton lavinskii came up in  with the notion of a city on springs  a notsoremote ancestor of some of the walkingcity fantasies thrown off by the archigram designers in england in the s and vladimir tatlin the russian constructivist dreamed up what he hoped would be an everymans bicycle of the air the wooden letatlin on which he hoped members of the proletariat having slipped the surly bonds of earth would go gliding about from peoples dormitory to peoples cultural centre of course it did not and could not fly tatlins most grandly useless conception however which has always been the darling of radical art historians was his design for a monument to the third international  it was to be a gigantic openframe ziggurat of steel spiralling up from the middle of petrograd and dwarfing everything on the citys skyline it would be built on a diagonal representing that of the earths axis it would contain four enormous glass halls each containing a different ceremonial structure for the party all turning at different speeds the lowest one a cylinder would rotate once a year the next a pyramid would turn once a month and so on to the topmost hall another cylinder going round once a day but although it would have some generally designated uses these were never thought through  they were just part of the cloudy rhetoric that served to hide the disastrous shortages the revolution produced the whole affair would be  metres high but it never materialised because it would have used up far more structural steel than the whole of russia had it was the unbuilt and unbuildable tower of a babylonian socialism perhaps some faint ghost of it lingers in those enormous and pointless space needles later constructed in the capitalist west in places such as seattle and sydney capped with revolving restaurants serving pretentious food this hope of world improvement expressed itself everywhere in the most idealist and highfalutin language the people who used it have become fixtures in the firmament of thcentury art although they did not achieve what they thought their work could do art is a universal and real expression of creative energy wrote the constructivist artists el lissitzky russian hans richter german and theo van doesburg dutch in the early s it would be used to organise the progress of mankind it is the tool of universal progress if you didnt believe in progress you couldnt call yourself a modernist however being a modernist was not necessarily the same as being a functionalist the most extreme illustration of their difference was afforded by the work of the russian kazimir malevich who called himself a suprematist  the postwar years were a bumper season for increasingly sillyisms  and made designs for various notionally habitable structures big ones that he called architectons and little ones he named planits with an i malevich who had no scientific background was much given to waffling and burbling about how in the marvellous future people of all nations would foregather on these extraterrestrial objects creating termitaries of peace love and cooperation as they were carried through space the prime building material of progress of the longingly desired postwar utopia was glass glass had several symbolic qualities to recommend it first its fragility people remembered the gaping window frames the shattered and empty openings left in the wake of the great war a society with intact glass buildings manifestly was a society at peace then not only was glass fragile with the correct framing it could be very strong though not in bending and amazing feats of structural daring could be executed in it nobody who had seen joseph paxtons crystal palace that prodigious triumph of british engineering could possibly doubt that glass was the very opposite to heavy stone and opaque brick light streamed through it the light of heaven itself this offered social redemption glass forms crystalline and suggestive of weightlessness seemed to be the stuff of transcendence glass carried implications of myth of other soontobebuilt crystal palaces glück ohne glas wie dumm ist das began one architects paean to the wonderful substance  joy without glass what stupidity the sharpest expression of this utopian rapture was demolished long ago an allglass pavilion resembling a faceted islamic dome that had been commissioned from the architect bruno taut by the german glass industry for the  werkbund industrial exhibition in cologne its likeness survives today only in drawings photos and a model or two the building was pervaded by colour shining from a reflecting pool of violet water and although it is not clear just what the colour sequences were by a kaleidoscope in the dome this pavilion was tiny almost toylike but it bears a distant similarity to one of the great buildings of the early st century  norman fosters gherkin in london the swiss re building modernism left its handprints everywhere especially in communications in typography and in the design of household objects from gropius and mies chairs to the lamps of marianne brandt which have never dated though they were designed  years ago and remain wholly covetable and yet one of the strange facts about modernism is that given its recentness and the enormous spread of its ideas so little of it remains this makes it extremely difficult maybe impossible to think ones way back into the cultural fanaticism that gripped some european modernists in the s and s breeding contradictory reductionist movements like viruses in a lab and leading the designer architectpainter theo van doesburg to declare art should not deal with the useful or the nice but with the spiritual and the sublime the purest art forms do not cause the decorative change of some detail from life but the inner metamorphosis of life the revaluation of all values this was way too much to expect of a few blocks of workers flats the hopeful rhetoric of modernism was always way way out in front of its actual products modernists were always hoping that big business big planning big government would latch on to their designs and make them generally available to people preferably workers who would recognise their benefits and gratefully use them alas it didnt happen that way there was not enough demand for radical designs of common household things let alone buildings or whole suburbs to attract anything like a mass market which is why the occasional isolated bauhaus workshop object a jug attributable to johannes itten or a prototype gropius chair creates excitement among collectors today such things never entered the vernacular still less did the ugly standardised clothes some modernist designers tatlin and alexander rodchenko among them proposed for the new millennium universal worker clothing unisex democratic and cheap would come from the american mills of levi strauss not from european or russian avantgardists what ordinary people wanted was culture they could relax into  the middleclass comfort of the upholstered armchair not the bracing challenging austerities of chrome tubes and leather thongs what modernism whose singing school was the bauhaus presided over by gropius and others proposed to them was something rather different the virtuous but not very alluring prospect of what german ideologues called wohnung für das existenzminimum minimumexistence housing with its bedrooms the size of closets and closets hardly bigger than shoeboxes this had its reformative even its holy aspect when gropius in  wrote a program for the first state bauhaus which was set up in weimar he invoked the images of a cathedral a crystal edifice a new community of faith expressing itself in craft at the root there was always something penitential about modernism with its stern abjuration of the worlds sensuous pleasures in the interest of higher ones you were never left in any doubt that the monks cell was a better place to be than the capitalists study let alone his wifes boudoir if few modernist objects remain even less of its architecture survives the vas show does what it can with drawings and photographs but these can never suffice the fact is not much of it was actually built and of what there was so much was torn down i didnt altogether realise this until  years ago i and a team from the bbc were engaged in making a television series the shock of the new we needed to film some great canonical building in europe that would exemplify all that passion over form and function the abolition of ornament the stripping away of superfluous detail the overriding myths and utopian metaphors of the machine age and one of the first things we found was that such buildings mainly existed on paper hardly at all in the real world once the designers ideas of what society needed came up against the things real people seemed to want there was a collision that often amounted to a fiasco the memorable example for me was the one building in which charlesedouard jeanneretgris  the swiss watchmakers son who went by the name of le corbusier was able to pour out his notions of social amelioration through housing the unité dhabitation in marseilles which began receiving its first tenants in  raised on its thick raw concrete stilts massive and domineering the unité became an instant classic of modern architecture just about everyone in the profession adored it or said they did the only people who couldnt stand the great grimy beast were the luckless ones who lived in it we found when we arrived there in  that it was in pitiable condition corbus béton brut couldnt be cleaned the metalframed windows were hopelessly corroded the electricity kept shorting out the brisesoleils or concrete sunscreens were permanently foul with pigeon shit the shopping street halfway up inside was locked and shuttered because ordinary french people prefer to do their marketing on real streets an obvious aspect of social behaviour that eluded the intellectual grasp of the formgiver who believed that folk ought to behave in accordance with the dotty authoritarian notions of idealist philosophes like saintsimon and fourier saddest of all was the roof which corbu had imagined as a sort of concrete acropolis dedicated to the cult of the sun and of physical culture like a greek palaestra complete with pools and jogging track it was a chaos of dried slime and broken cinderblocks and when the concierge who hated the place granted us admission to his flat in the unité we found that he and his wife had valiantly fought back against the functionalist plainness corbu had prescribed for the residents it was chockablock with fringes bobbles and tassels louis this and that and even a departmentstore rococo chandelier which due to the lowness of the ceiling almost touched the diningtable here the working class had ceased to be the abstraction corbu fancied it had taken its revenge on the modernist emperor i sometimes wonder if the decor of that concierges flat is still the same today · modernism
