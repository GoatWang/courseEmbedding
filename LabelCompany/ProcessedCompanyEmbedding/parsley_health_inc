within  weeks with parsley health i noticed a remarkable difference in my asthma symptoms and was able to reduce my medications significantly parsley’s state of the art testing also showed i was prediabetic so we quickly identified problematic foods and sugar sources i feel confident that the parsley team will help me live the healthy and prescription drugfree life i deserve”“parsley health’s data was unlike anything i had ever seen before dr berzin diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease called hashimotos thyroiditis none of my doctors had even mentioned it was a possibility that was what was making me tired depressed and gaining weight we’ve essentially been able to eliminate all of the symptoms the most unexpected benefit has been the mental clarity that i’ve rediscovered over the

a good quality magnesium supplement todayby jacqueline damboragianfacebookemailtwitterpinterestlinkedin there’s a supplement you can take that will help you chill out sleep better and poop often it’s called magnesium and if you’re living a busy life in  you need it more than ever  magnesium is involved in over  enzymatic reactions in the body including energy metabolism and protein synthesis half of us are deficient in it that’s why at parsley we test your micronutrient levelsstress depletes magnesium stores as does excess alcohol consumption eating processed foods taking antibiotics and taking certain drugs like high blood pressure meds and diureticshere are the top  benefits of magnesium supplementation that we most commonly see a need for at parsley reduces insomnia can’t sleep  magnesium glycinate pills or a hot epsom salt magnesium sulphate bath can untense your muscles and help to relax your whole body promoting a sense of sleepiness for a good night’s rest helps alleviate constipation if you’re feeling stopped up magnesium citrate can get things moving again it helps relax the muscles of the digestive tract and neutralize stomach acid allowing your poop to pass on take it at night for a healthy bowel movement first thing in the morning prevents migraines magnesium plays a role in neurotransmitter function and blood circulation regulating the blood vessel constriction that often leads to migraines here’s a previous post on how to avoid migraines calms your nerves dr berzin calls it “nature’s antianxiety drug”  stress can be a cause of magnesium deficiency and low magnesium levels can magnify the stress response so we need more mg in times of stress which is why robin floated naked in a pool of it last weekend relieves muscle pain and cramping hi pmsnot having enough magnesium available to our muscles can cause muscle spasms that often lead to pain cramping or twitching taking a supplement can help muscles including those lining the uterus to contract and relax normallydietary sources  sea vegetables such as kelp and dulse almonds cashews walnuts shrimp avocado beans and garlicunfortunately magnesium is not routinely checked by most conventional doctors at parsley we check your levels and then personalize your plan accordinglyit’s medicine the way the should beschedule a time to chat with someone from the team we’d love

a link that takes you to the indepth nutritional profile for parsley featuring information over  nutrients can be found under the food rating system chart health benefitsdescriptionhistoryhow to select and storetips for preparing and cookinghow to enjoynutritional profilereferences health benefits a sprig of parsley can provide much more than a decoration on your plate parsley contains two types of unusual components that provide unique health benefits the first type is volatile oil components—including myristicin limonene eugenol and alphathujene the second type is flavonoids—including apiin apigenin crisoeriol and luteolin promote optimal health parsleys volatile oils—particularly myristicin—have been shown to inhibit tumor formation in animal studies and particularly tumor formation in the lungs myristicin has also been shown to activate the enzyme glutathionestransferase which helps attach the molecule glutathione to oxidized molecules that would otherwise do damage in the body the activity of parsleys volatile oils qualifies it as a chemoprotective food and in particular a food that can help neutralize particular types of carcinogens like the benzopyrenes that are part of cigarette smoke and charcoal grill smoke a rich source of antioxidant nutrients the flavonoids in parsley—especially luteolin—have been shown to function as antioxidants that combine with highly reactive oxygencontaining molecules called oxygen radicals and help prevent oxygenbased damage to cells in addition extracts from parsley have been used in animal studies to help increase the antioxidant capacity of the blood in addition to its volatile oils and flavonoids parsley is an excellent source of vitamin c and a good source of vitamin a notably through its concentration of the provitamin a carotenoid betacarotene vitamin c has many different functions it is the bodys primary watersoluble antioxidant rendering harmless otherwise dangerous free radicals in all watersoluble areas of the body high levels of free radicals contribute to the development and progression of a wide variety of diseases including atherosclerosis colon cancer diabetes and asthma this may explain why people who consume healthy amounts of vitamin ccontaining foods have reduced risks for all these conditions vitamin c is also a powerful antiinflammatory agent which explains its usefulness in conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and since vitamin c is needed for the healthy function of the immune system it can also be helpful for preventing recurrent ear infections or colds betacarotene another important antioxidant works in the fatsoluble areas of the body diets with betacarotenerich foods are also associated with a reduced risk for the development and progression of conditions like atherosclerosis diabetes and colon cancer like vitamin c betacarotene may also be helpful in reducing the severity of asthma osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and betacarotene is converted by the body to vitamin a a nutrient so important to a strong immune system that its nickname is the antiinfective vitamin parsley for a healthy heart parsley is a good source of folic acid one of the most important b vitamins while it plays numerous roles in the body one of its most critical roles in relation to cardiovascular health is its necessary participation in the process through which the body converts homocysteine into benign molecules homocysteine is a potentially dangerous molecule that at high levels can directly damage blood vessels and high levels of homocysteine are associated with a significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke in people with atherosclerosis or diabetic heart disease enjoying foods rich in folic acid like parsley is an especially good idea for individuals who either have or wish to prevent these diseases folic acid is also a critical nutrient for proper cell division and is therefore vitally important for cancerprevention in two areas of the body that contain rapidly dividing cells—the colon and in women the cervix protection against rheumatoid arthritis while one study suggests that high doses of supplemental vitamin c makes osteoarthritis a type of degenerative arthritis that occurs with aging worse in laboratory animals another indicates that vitamin crich foods such as parsley provide humans with protection against inflammatory polyarthritis a form of rheumatoid arthritis involving two or more joints the findings presented in the annals of the rheumatic diseases were drawn from a study of more than  subjects who kept diet diaries and were arthritisfree when the study began and focused on subjects who developed inflammatory polyarthritis and similar subjects who remained arthritisfree during the followup period subjects who consumed the lowest amounts of vitamin crich foods were more than three times more likely to develop arthritis than those who consumed the highest amounts so next time parsley appears on your plate as a garnish recognize its true worth and partake of its abilities to improve your health as an added bonus youll also enjoy parsleys legendary ability to cleanse your palate and your breath at the end of your meal description while parsley is a wonderfully nutritious and healing food it is often underappreciated most people do not realize that this vegetable has more uses than just being a decorative garnish that accompanies restaurant meals they do not know that parsley is actually a storehouse of nutrients and that it features a delicious green and vibrant taste the two most popular types of parsley are curly parsley and italian flat leaf parsley the italian variety has a more fragrant and less bitter taste than the curly variety there is also another type of parsley known as turniprooted or hamburg that is cultivated for its roots which resemble salsify and burdock parsley belongs to the umbelliferae family of plants and its latin name is petroselinum crispum history parsley is native to the mediterranean region of southern europe while it has been cultivated for more than  years parsley was used medicinally prior to being consumed as a food the ancient greeks held parsley to be sacred using it to not only adorn victors of athletic contests but also for decorating the tombs of the deceased the practice of using parsley as a garnish actually has a long history that can be traced back to the civilization of the ancient romans while it is uncertain when parsley began to be consumed as a seasoning it seems to be sometime in the middle ages in europe some historians credit charlemagne with its popularization since he had it grown on his estates in some countries the curly leaf variety is more popular this may have its roots in the ancient preference for this type since people were oftentimes reticent to consume the flat leaf variety because it resembled fools parsley a poisonous weed turniprooted or hamburg parsley a relatively new species having only been developed within the past two hundred years has only recently begun gaining popularity how to select and store whenever possible choose fresh parsley over the dried form of the herb since it is superior in flavor choose fresh parsley that is deep green in color and looks fresh and crisp avoid bunches that have leaves that are wilted or yellow as this indicates that they are either overmature or damaged just like with other dried herbs if you choose to purchase dried parsley flakes try to select organically grown parsley since this will give you more assurance that the herbs have not been irradiated fresh parsley should be kept in the refrigerator in a plastic bag if the parsley is slightly wilted either sprinkle it lightly with some water or wash it without completely drying it before storing in the refrigerator if you have excess flat leaf parsley you can easily dry it by laying it out in a single layer on a clean kitchen cloth once dried it should be kept in a tightly sealed container in a cool dark and dry place curly leaf parsley is best preserved by freezing as opposed to drying although it will retain most of its flavor it has a tendency to lose its crispness so it is best used in recipes without first thawing tips for preparing and cooking tips for preparing parsley fresh parsley should be washed right before using since it is highly fragile the best way to clean it is just like you would spinach place it in a bowl of cold water and swish it around with your hands this will allow any sand or dirt to dislodge remove the leaves from the water empty the bowl refill it with clean water and repeat this process until no dirt remains in the water since it has a stronger flavor than the curly variety italian flat leaf parsley holds up better to cooking and therefore is usually the type preferred for hot dishes it should be added towards the end of the cooking process so that it can best retain its taste color and nutritional value if you are making a light colored sauce use the stems from this variety as opposed to the leaves so the sauce will take on the flavor of parsley but will not be imparted with its green color how to enjoy a few quick serving ideas combine chopped parsley with bulgur wheat chopped green onions scallions mint leaves lemon juice and olive oil to make the middle eastern classic dish tabouli add parsley to pesto sauce to add more texture to its green color combine chopped parsley garlic and lemon zest and use it as a rub for chicken lamb and beef use parsley in soups and tomato sauces serve a colorful salad of fennel orange cherry tomatoes pumpkin seeds and parsley leaves chopped parsley can be sprinkled on a host of different recipes including salads vegetable sautés and grilled fish for some of our favorite recipes click recipes nutritional profile parsley is an excellent of vitamin k and vitamin c as well as a good source of vitamin a folate and iron parsleys volatile oil components include myristicin limonene eugenol and alphathujene its flavonoids include apiin apigenin crisoeriol and luteolin introduction to food rating system chart in
