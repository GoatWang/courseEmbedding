larocco mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo thanks tara and good morning everyone our first quarter results were a clear indication that our hard work over the last  months to turn around state auto is working i am very pleased that the improvement across the lines of business we have determined are core ongoing lines personal auto home farm and ranch personal and commercial umbrella commercial auto workers comp  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call small and midmarket commercial and es property and casualty the lines we have exited large commercial trucking healthcare and programs continue to negatively impact the overall number but the ongoing lines are either performing well have positive trends or are where we expected at this point in the turnaround most notably the auto results both commercial and personal are trending as we hoped based on the proactive and focused actions we have taken kim and jess will provide specifics it is clear to us that were making progress based on the highlevel steps we have taken rebuilding or building our pricing models taking numerous large targeted and appropriate rate increases eliminating unnecessary process aligning our associates and distribution partners behind a single goal of profitable growth attacking and eliminating wasteful spend and most importantly building and launching our new digital technology platform in any successful turnaround there are  phases analysis fix and execution at the end of  we had completed the fix phase meaning the vast majority of the gaps we uncovered across the company have been corrected our foundation is now strong were now in the execution phase it is about running the organization and delivering on our goal of profitable growth because progress happens on a sequential quarterly weekly and sometimes even daily basis the  quarter trend from the end of q  to the end of q  is the best indicator of our progress whether its the amount of rate were getting improved claims performance or delivery of technology as you compare our results it is clear our direction is positive now please do not take my optimism regarding our improvement as belief that were where we need to be our overall results even excluding the exited lines of business remain unacceptable no one at state auto will ever stop pushing for improvement we still have a long way to go but im very proud of the distance we have traveled and can see our efforts in the numbers of course this quarters overall results were significantly impacted by an unusual large amount of cat loss activity more than  times what we would expect in a normal first quarter obviously this was disappointing from a financial standpoint but its a reality of our business what matters as much as the financials is the devastating impact these weather events had on our customers responding quickly helping people both financially and with emotional support is what we do here at state auto and across our industry too often we let others from outside our industry and now even new entrants to the property and casualty space control the narrative about our great industry they mischaracterize our industry as one that places profit above people and minimize the valuable financial support and peace of mind we provide to policyholders in their time of need heres the truth whether its a catastrophic event a simple auto claim with no injuries or helping with a coverage concern we respond this quarter again our state auto claims team was magnificent they responded with speed fairness and empathy our industry should always always be proud of what we do never more so than during times of severe weather finally id like to address expenses steve will provide context on why we had an increase in our expense ratio more broadly i want to address how we view expenses both over the short term which i define as the next  to  months and the long term we are a disciplined and frugal organization across our entire associate base we know that to win over the long run we must be efficient and that efficiency would be measured by having a competitive expense ratio however state auto will not take the short term view of slashing expenses and not making the muchneeded investment in technology data and analytics we know that real transformation is upon us to win going forward we cannot take the slow and expensive approach to rebuilding old and ineffective legacy technology instead we feel our approach of standing up our new digital platform is the correct decision and our early results demonstrate that of course that investment requires the willingness to accept that while we transition it will be a battle to maintain and slightly reduce our expense ratio every day we look for savings every day we seek ways to reduce process and unneeded steps every single day im confident that work along with top line growth will help offset enough of our investment and allow us to make modest improvements to our expense ratio in the short term period with the support of our board were executing a bold strategy and plan that will allow state auto to emerge as one of the winners as the pc industry goes through a dramatic transformation and with that ill turn it over to our chief financial officer steve english steve steve english  state auto financial corporation  svp cfo thanks mike good morning everyone today i will touch upon cats reserve development and expenses but before i do im sure you noticed the change in our reporting format presenting statutory combined ratios by product this is how under our new product management approach were internally monitoring and managing our businesses this is the next step resulting from organizational changes we began to make in late  and into  the allocation of expenses both underwriting and claims  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call across product lines involves assumptions and estimates and given the size of some of the premium basis can and will result in movement in ratios from quarterto quarter as we continue to evolve our operations our product teams actuaries and accountants will refine and improve how these expenses are classified we have provided a quarterly breakdown of  along with the first quarter of  we believe this new presentation will assist in better understanding our results i also want to comment about the product lines themselves you will notice premiums for personal and commercial lines will not match the previously reported amounts in the past certain personal line amounts were reported within commercial lines due to immateriality and convenience examples would include personal dwelling fire or personal umbrella activity being reported as fire and allied or other and product liability the new product lines for the most part are selfexplanatory other personal lines previously primarily our farm and ranch product now represents mostly personal umbrella and dwelling fire other commercial is primarily commercial umbrella and nonpackaged commercial property exposures small commercial is essentially our bop product and middle market commercial is our package products personal auto homeowners commercial auto workers compensation and specialty lines were largely unaffected by this change lets move onto catastrophe experienced in the quarter we disclosed on april  our estimated cat losses were approximately  points for the quarter the final impact was  points which is significantly higher than the first quarter average for the last  years of  points as our release disclosed there were  events in the quarter our storm losses were widespread impacting the ohio valley region along with the southeast us and texas the month of march was particularly severe has accounted for nearly  of the losses for the quarter slightly more than half within our homeowners line of business stfc reported overall favorable development for the quarter of  million or  points compared to first quarter a year ago when development was adverse in the amount of  million or  points as we discussed on our yearend call we started to see personal and commercial auto estimates for  and prior stabilize in the back half of  and first quarter continued that trend excluding cat and ulae development personal auto reported a modest redundancy for the second quarter in a row and no significant change was made to our  estimates commercial auto benefited from  million of net favorable development coming mainly from the  and  accident years partially offset by revision upward in  loss estimates the homeowner line of business experienced  million of adverse development mainly from  which included  large losses occurring in the last  weeks of the year other commercial benefited from  million of takedowns from  and  lastly some comments on the expense ratio which was up  points from first quarter a year ago and  points compared to the full year  expense ratio almost half of this increase is a timing issue related to deferred acquisition cost beginning the first quarter of  our specialty underwriting operation which is owned by state automobile mutual or sam as we call it no longer charges for its services based on the percentage of premiums actual costs are now being charged and as such no longer vary directly with and in proportion to premium the impact is we are deferring less cost on to the balance sheet even though there has not been any real change in the economics or services provided amounts previously deferred will runoff during  and result in a temporary increase to the gaap expense ratio the balance of the increase involves added it costs as we continue to invest in the future as well as to support the rollout of our new policy issuance and administration system including amortization of previously deferred costs please keep in mind sam bears the cost of developing our systems and recovers stfcs shares of these costs via the cost sharing and intercompany pooling agreement as systems come online and sam begins to amortize capitalized costs these are then charged to stfc as we have discussed on past calls we are working to reduce other costs to offset this investment bubble as these investments are the necessary first steps to enable us to become more efficient in the future and with that ill turn the call over to kim kim garland  state auto financial corporation  svp director standard line managing director state auto labs thanks steve and good morning everyone as you look at our personal lines results the story for each product line is the following personal auto for the quarter the loss and alae ratio which is what we have previously shared is  the loss and lae ratio which includes ulae now is  and the combined ratio is  personal auto cat loss and alae ratio for first quarter  was  points which is  points higher than the q  personal auto cat loss and alae ratio of  points  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call our plan for improving personal auto profitability has been consistent and in each quarter ive been updating you on our progress on each set of actions heres this quarters update loss reserve development development on prior accident years was relatively minimal for the third conservative quarter aggressive overall rate actions across our  personal auto states and multiple programs within some states our rate change activity has been as follows q  the average rate change was  q  the average rate change was  q  the average rate change was  fourth quarter of  we took  rate changes with an average of  for the rate change q  we took  rate changes with an average  rate change and second quarter  subject to doi approval in some states we have  rate changes scheduled with an average  rate change impact we are now seeing these rate changes start to flow into our personal auto book of business average written premium per vehicle in march of  is  higher than in march of  as a reminder there is a lag before this increase in written premium shows up as a comparable increase in earned premium we have also started to see pressure on retention from our personal auto rate increases personal auto retention declined in the quarter and march  retention is currently at   point lower than our march  retention while were starting to see pressure on retention personal auto new business was still up this quarter q  new business was  higher than q  new business heres progress on our operational changes over the prior quarters we have discussed the operational changes in our claims organization we are seeing the early signs of impact of this in our loss cost trend data the following are all  quarter rolling loss cost trends for property damage this quarters trend was  loss cost trend was  this is the second consecutive quarter that it has been below  and the first time this has occurred since q  collision the loss cost trend was plus  the last  loss cost trend data points for collision were second quarter  of plus  third quarter  of plus  fourth quarter  of plus  and first quarter  of plus  bodily injury the loss cost trend was plus  this is the first time that our bi loss cost trend has been below  since q  many of our claims operational metrics which are one of the drivers of the loss cost trend results have improved and we are fanatical about continuing to work the cycle of improving claims operational metrics leading to improved loss cost trends it is not a secret that the math behind improving loss ratio is to make the rate of increase of premium greater than the rate of increase in loss cost we believe the work that has been done to date has set us on this path and that we are seeing the early signs of this in the data we know that we have to continue to work both sides of this equation managing the premium trend and managing the loss cost trend growth while improving profitability results is the highest priority for the personal auto product line weve also continued to work to start growing personal auto again our performance in this area is as follows net written premium for personal auto was up  in q  versus q  this is the third consecutive quarter of personal auto net written premium increase after  quarters of declining personal auto net written premium quotes were up  over q  new business counts are up  q  over q  retention as i shared before is down  points march  versus march  and our  for policiesinforce the rate of pif decline deteriorated a little this quarter last quarter weve  pif was shrinking  march  versus march  pif declined  policiesinforce growth of personal auto and homeowners was pressured and will be pressured over the next several quarters as we take rate increases in personal auto it is not surprising that our conversion ratio will decline and impact our personal auto new business numbers and that will also have some impact on homeowners new business numbers given that these products are often packaged together last quarter i told you that the other factor that pressured our growth was the launch of our new platform and pricing models in auto and homeowners in  states in q  that postlaunch there was a shakeout period where agents had to get used to the new system that when our new platform and pricing models were launched in the real world we would get feedback on things that we needed to adjust improve and optimize this feedback came in  areas rates from the launch of our new pricing model generally ended up being higher than we expected and the usability of the system needed to be improved and optimized based on feedback from being out in the real world during the first quarter these  items were fiercely worked on and addressed pricing models were adjusted refiled and relaunched based on this realworld feedback home in february auto in march systems usability enhancements were implemented every  weeks during the quarter after these changes these states are now on a trajectory to be a net positive to our new business and growth results rather than the net negative they were in q  and q  this shakeout period in the learning curve was just a necessary step that we had to go through  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call in march we launched our sixth state colorado the smooth and the sudden launch exceeded our expectations and the state auto leadership team visited colorado last week to directly speak with agents and we received an overwhelmingly positive feedback about the launch of the system and the rates as we launch the rest of the states this year for auto and home the growth impact of this should help offset the pressure from doubledigit personal auto rate increases on our inforce book on to homeowners the loss and alae ratio again as we have shared in previous quarters was  the loss and lae ratio including ulae now is  and a combined ratio of  the homeowners catastrophe loss and lae ratio for q  was  points which is  points higher than the q  homeowners cat loss and alae ratio of  points what we also saw as we normally see in high cat quarters is that the noncat weather losses were higher than normal we continue to be comfortable that our overall rate levels in homeowners are adequate growth homeowners is another product line where we had to reverse the policiesinforce decline our performance in this area is as follows net written premium for homeowners was down  q  versus q  quotes are up  over q  new business counts are down  q  over q  retention is up  points march  versus march  and the rate of policiesinforce decline flattened out in q  december  versus december  pif declined  in march of  versus march of  pif decline was also minus  understanding the growth results for homeowners new business is down in homeowners versus up in personal auto because of the rate miss in the first  launch states was greater than it was in auto so the negative new business impact was greater were seeing this dynamic reverse with the relaunched rates were not taking rate increases in homeowners like we are in personal auto so the net written premium growth is going to be driven by  or not by driven by primarily policiesinforce growth for farm and ranch we had a combined ratio of  for the quarter this was primarily driven by an abnormally high cat loss quarter q  cat loss and alae ratio was  which was  points higher than the q  cat loss and alae ratio of  new business and retention are up in this product line and q  pif increased  over q  we continue to be very very excited about the opportunities in our farm and ranch business in summary personal lines for state auto can be thought about in the following way with a high catastrophe quarter were taking doubledigit personal auto rate increases combined with claims operational improvements which are starting to drive the change in premium curve above the change in loss cost curve which is what we need to do to improve the personal auto loss ratio personal auto rate increases will place pressure on auto and home retention and new business volumes for the next several quarters and we have passed through the shakeout period of the launch of the new platform for auto and homeowners and we anticipate it to be an accelerant to growth going forward as we roll out the reminder of states we will continue to share the progress on our platform each quarter now ill turn you over to jessica to discuss the business and specialty segment results jessica clark  state auto financial corporation  svp director specialty and commercial lines thank you kim i am very pleased with the trends this quarter which reflects the progress that our team has made over the last  months while our overall result was adversely impacted by unusually high cat losses our noncat loss and alae ratios improved over  points from first quarter last year including some improvement in every line of business this improvement is a reflection of all the work we have done on product redesign rate underwriting and claims leakage while there is still more work to do and we continue to face increasing loss cost trends in auto the profitability action taken in rate underwriting and claims should start to show positive impact each quarter we expect to see continual improvement in our noncat loss ratio as these actions earn in while the profit improvements have put pressure on growth opportunities we see encouraging signs for new business yeartodate net written premiums for commercial lines was down  earned premiums was down  as we earn out the overall premiums declined from  which was mostly caused by our prior exit from large account solutions however direct new business premium is up  compared to q  i attribute the increase to our messaging around commercial lines appetite and our refocus on distribution we are getting more of the right submissions ones where we can be competitive and profitable and where we can win the momentum is there and i am confident that in the second half of  the launch of our new commercial lines quoting and policy management system for small business will give us the technology tools products and efficiencies needed  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call to grow our small business lines quickly and profitably retention overall was strong except for commercial auto which was down due to profitability actions taken across the book and our decision to nonrenew certain policies lets dive deeper into each area commercial auto continued the improvement we saw in the fourth quarter posting a loss and alae ratio  points better than a year ago benefiting from  points of favorable development on prior years while the current accident quarter is not seeing significant improvement yet the accident year basis results have stabilized and we expect significant improvement as all the changes we made earn out through the course of the year our new business price per vehicle continue to increase now coming in at  higher than it was  years ago as a result of the actions taken over the past  months we have also earned  in rate increases on renewals in  and have updated our pricing tool for another  in the first quarter of  starting in the second half of the year were expecting that  to grow to  however we are not just getting rates to get commercial auto rates where we need them we had to take other actions as well which when combined with rate will give us the improvements we need our progress at fixing these leakage items is critical and encouraging underwriter training focused on properly identifying risk characteristics and exposures has resulted in a large shift and rate tier placement and risk classification while the exposure characteristics of our new business in  has remained consistent to prior years we now have  increase in the risks classified as commercial receiving a higher rate for the right exposure and approximately  of our book is now rated in the higher standard tier in q  compared to only  in  both led to significant increase in new business pricing we also completed a review of our portfolio and identified about  of the book which on average performed  points worse than the rest of our book on these policies we have worked to reunderwrite nonrenew or achieve significant price increases again this is not a onetime fix and we will continue to improve pricing and underwriting finally we are seeing favorable metrics from the work that paul stachura and his claims team have done to reduce claims leakage examples include reducing bodily injury pending counts by  increase fraud investigation referrals and improved vendor management moving on to our small commercial book which is made up of our bop business the first quarter noncat results on a direct accident year basis at  months maturity is significantly improved for both  and  when compared to   and  the current quarter contains  points of favorable development which offsets much of the  points increase in cat losses resulting in a loss and alae ratio for the quarter that is  point improvement over q  bop is a product in which we have seen consistent improvements in loss ratio in the last  years and we continue to be confident that our current bop product is now focused on the right risks at the right prices and is underwritten appropriately the improvement is mostly attributable to the work we have done around underwriting risk selection and product classification we have completed the product redesigns model updates and pricing models for our new small business digital bop and commercial auto products which will launch in conjunction with our new quoting and policy management platform rollout for small commercial targeted for the second half of  in  states followed by the remaining states throughout the remainder of  and early  we believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the small business space for the company with the right products and technology which increase ease of doing business and improve pricing segmentation our launch will include an innovative telematics option for commercial auto and we will quickly add in other sensorbased product options our middle market book is made up of our commercial package business the noncat loss and alae ratio improved slightly but was impacted by  points of prior year unfavorable development related to prior period fire losses as commercial lines property starts to soften and competition increases we continue to stay on top of loss cost trends and remain focused on underwriting discipline as the market has not yet capitalized on technology in different ways to transact business we believe there is significant opportunity in this space we have focused a great amount of time on defining and communicating our appetite and reinvigorating and retraining our sales team which has paid off new business premium is up  for the quarter which as a percentage is large however our base was smaller in q  driven by the exit of large accounts field restructuring and rate action while we are truly being more successful in the market were also replacing poorperforming business with the business we want workers compensation continues to see strong results and we continue to see prior years develop betterthanexpected claims trends remains strong with the improvement in the rolling month average and loss time days and a claims closing ratio of over  this stands as a testament to our continued discipline and niche focus in this product as the market softens driven by  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call reductions in state loss costs and competitive pressures we have maintained our underwriting discipline we have seen new business reductions of  yearoveryear but renewables remain in line with expectations despite market conditions we expect new business to improve over the remainder of  as we execute a crosssell strategy with our state auto bop and cpp business and expand rtw distribution to more state auto agencies even as industry pricing pressures persist we believe a combination of increased exposure base along with our competitive advantage through our case and claims management will enable workers compensation to remain a long term strategic profitable product for us overall for commercial lines expenses picked up  points yearoveryear as we continue to invest in our future policy administration system and the new product offerings which will be enabled by that platform the long term benefit of this investment will be significant improvement and efficiencies in cost savings coupled with the ability to gain scale through top line growth moving on to specialty last year was a year of pruning we made a lot of tough decisions about what products to continue in that are core to our business and what products to exit due to profitability or investment requirements the products that we decided to exit added more than  points to our loss and alae ratio this quarter cat losses in the quarter were driven by  large tornado loss in our es property book the expense ratio is down  points as we grew net written premium  with flat expenses we continue to emphasize underwriting discipline in some challenging marketplaces lets dive deeper into each of these areas our es property loss and alae ratio was up  points over q  due to the large tornado cat in louisiana the noncat loss and alae ratio is down a little less than a point from last year and is at a consistent profitable and expected level of  the expense ratio for es property is down  points from last year but is generally high because of the large amount of ceded premium paid to our cat reinsurance treaty with no associated ceding commission we have not seen any positive changes in the property market rates continue to fall and the marketplace is loosening on coverage offerings through lower deductibles and other means of increasing exposure we are fighting this through strong risk selection and maintaining underwriting discipline our new internal property team continues to grow and net written premium is up  from q last year again a large percentage but remember this team is new and is only writing new business so all premium is growth we anticipate further growth as this team continues to build up the book we are also excited about our internal teams collaboration with our third party property partners to offer unique products to the market they will have to be creative to combat some of the undisciplined pricing and coverage decisions that we are seeing being made by competitors we continue to see strong growth in the es casualty with a  increase in net written premiums compared to last year both our excess casualty and gas and propane distribution books experienced doubledigit rate increases on the auto liability component this quarter that helped drive the yearoveryear premium growth the overall casualty and alae ratio is up  points from q  driven by two things one the healthcare book that we exited last year contributed  points and two current accident year loss ratio picks are higher for our general liability line and umbrella lines of business each of the ongoing books making up es casualty have developed profitability initiatives and are executing on those now for example we are conducting deep dives in the habitational portion of our primary gl book our actuarial team is refining and enhancing our triage and predictive models to add more variables to help identify the specific risk characteristics which drive losses to unprofitable levels it will take time for these actions to earn in but with the leadership team in place and relentless underlying discipline on the frontline we remain very confident in the long term outlook of this unit rates dropped dramatically on all auto exposures and are stable for general liability exposures and we expect improvement in this line as rates earn out as disclosed last year programs is being put into runoff most programs have found other carriers and are expected to stop writing on our paper in advance of the scheduled termination date for that program the remaining programs which have not yet terminated or scheduled to terminate this quarter and will stop writing new business by june  unless a later date has been agreed to results while better than last year driven by a stabilization of prior year reserves continue to be at unacceptable levels in the current accident year audits were conducted on all of our programs this quarter to ensure that underwriting discipline remains through the actual date of the termination prior year development contributed  points to the loss ratio which was less than the adverse development seen in recent years program net written premiums are down  quarterover quarter as a result of terminations and many of the programs already being in runoff with that we will open the line for questions  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call question and answer operator operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of paul newsome of sandler oneill your line is open paul newsome  sandler oneill  analyst maybe we can get just a little bit more detail on the expense ratio forecast as we look out longer term am i right that sort of half of this could be for the remainder of  and the other half is largely a permanent amortization level steve english  state auto financial corporation  svp cfo paul this is steve yes so to break that down lets first talk about the dac change which was about a half of the delta yearoveryear in the first quarter that should abate somewhat as the year moves on so i would expect the full year impact to that to be somewhere around  point in terms of the balance of the yearoveryear change this quarter which was driven by it costs you can think of that as more of a permanent change on a dollar basis because those are the costs that are now in place to support the new system thats been rolled out including amortization of deferred costs and of course itll take time on that system to start to write premiums against that cost so there is a bit of a lag there at the moment mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo paul this is mike thats why ill just kind of jump and say thats the variable that obviously is more difficult to project exactly when those premiums will begin to earn at a highenough rate to help offset that internally obviously we have a very clear plan in terms of our own internal expectations across each line of business im very pleased with the fact that were not presenting that to you i think in a very digestible fashion but from our standpoint weve taken each line of business looked at the investment in technology and other places around data and analytics looked at the premium plans and then the actual financial implication on each so we see the path to a competitive expense ratio we dont  we cant share much more than that but the factors steve laid out and then the ongoing issue on premium and then the final thing ill say is what i said in my comments and thats  there literally on a daily basis were looking for expenses that we believe we can eliminate things were doing that arent adding value steps processes and so on and so forth steve english  state auto financial corporation  svp cfo and paul to be clear that  point will then disappear in  because well have rolled through  year of the dac change paul newsome  sandler oneill  analyst okay thats great and the new disclosures are really helpful and very much appreciated the other thing i was looking to through those new disclosures looking at the expense ratio and i realized that there are allocation issues here but it seemed like just  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call generally speaking youre not far off from a fairly competitive auto expense ratio but commercial and home seem to be generally kind of high particularly the commercial any thoughts about sort of the allocation of expenses and where those cost cuts need to be is it really just an allocation issue when were looking at these things or is there some sense that you really do need to reduce expenses andor gain scale on those  in basically lines outside of auto mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo yes paul i mean just kind of at a high level we believe we have a lot of room to get even better on auto so ill just kind of set that aside and focus on your correct identification around primarily commercial and remember our commercial expense ratio today is a direct reflection of very dated old and legacy technology that technology requires us to have a level of labor and operational expenses that as we switch systems  in other words we move from an auto system that was below average to a new digital system that is we believe industryleading in commercial i wouldnt characterize what we have is below average i characterize it as very poor so the room for improvement in commercial is even greater ill ask jess to maybe add some commentary to that jessica clark  state auto financial corporation  svp director specialty and commercial lines yes paul this is jessica so just to piggyback on what mike said and maybe even for further example we touch every single commercial policy today which means we have to have a person obviously touch each one of those and our system is very difficult to useold green screen so as mike referred to we have a significant amount of labor to be able to handle that type of business and then as mike pointed out the new technology will give us the efficiencies and i think i made that comment in my prepared remarks will give us the efficiencies not only to be better about how we process the business because most of it will be straight through processing but also give us the ability to build scale because i think your point is correct that we have get much better on expenses but we also have to grow our top line to help support some of the fixed infrastructure that we have i would also say that our expense ratio especially in commercial auto and our small commercial product is elevated by a few points because of the investment in the guidewire systems so that piece will ultimately run off plus youll get the efficiencies and then youll get the top line so i would think about it in that order mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo and then one final comment about this investment remember this is not an adjustment to what is in the market today we have made the decision to become a digital property and casualty insurance company so in the  states where kim and his team have launched there is no paper there is no checks there is no postage there is no cash youre buying a policy from us with electronic signature just like youd buy something at amazoncom and so obviously this is new business at this point but as we move forward and eventually as we move our legacy business on this this is really about the longer term view of being a very different type of insurance company that truly has that level of efficiency operator your next question comes from the line of christopher campbell of kbw your line is open christopher campbell  keefe bruyette  woods inc  analyst  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call just a quick question on the specialty segment looking at es casualty strong growth this quarter but it looks like pretty much like the noncat loss ratio about  higher so im just wondering about your thoughts on growth given it looks like the core losses are that much higher yearoveryear jessica clark  state auto financial corporation  svp director specialty and commercial lines yes this is jessica again chris we have made some loss ratio picks in the current quarter to reflect sort of the more conservative view weve take on the standard line approach which we hadnt taken as much on the specialty side so thats one piece of it the second piece is that we have recognized the drivers of those higher loss ratio picks in our gl line which is our biggest sector which is our habitational book and our core gl book where were focusing our growth and contractors is performing significantly well and then the last thing i would say is our environmental book which looks to be high this quarter is attributable to  loss which we reviewed and wouldnt have written the accounting any differently and thats the other place where were focusing our growth and our umbrella book has inception to date been very profitable so i feel very good about where were growing in those es casualty segments mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo yes and chris this is mike im just going to tag on were really  we have a lot of confidence  really proud of our es casualty team and the quality of underwriting i want to emphasize jess point that this is not simply about loss ratio picks but this leadership team has demonstrated over the last  or  quarters that we believe in very simply  simple to say and harder to do kind of consistent conservative and appropriate reserve levels and i think that youre seeing that in the casualty picks and its about  particularly in those lines of business as you all know very well its better to be on that side of the equation because these are long long tail lines and were trying to be very thoughtful and good stewards of our performance and i think that it should not reflect in our ability to write the business effectively   christopher campbell  keefe bruyette  woods inc  analyst great and just a followup one so you were talking about higher loss picks so what is driving  what evidence are you seeing thats driving the higher loss picks is that litigation if you could share just what drivers that will be great jessica clark  state auto financial corporation  svp director specialty and commercial lines the driver in the higher loss picks which is primarily driven by our gl book is the habitational business or the olt segment so about  to  of that book is made up of the olt and habitational and the rest of it is contractors so thats the piece thats driving the gl book and again thats the piece that were addressing through both shrinkage and rate to the extent we keep any of that business on the umbrella book i would just say that that book is relatively small in size then its umbrella and its green so again as mike pointed out just being more conservative overall that book has performed very well to us but if weve had a few large losses in recent years just to be reflective of that but were not seeing any sort of great overall trend except for this trend in commercial auto which does effect umbrella that makes us have a different viewpoint on that line of business operator your next question comes from the line of larry greenberg of janney your line is open  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call larry greenberg  janney  analyst i was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit i think in kims comments he talked about some of the feedback that youre getting from your agents with the new system and i think you mentioned that it required some  that the effective rate was a little bit higher than you were expecting and you had to make a tweak to that if you could just give me a little more color on whats going on there kim garland  state auto financial corporation  svp director standard line managing director state auto labs so really two things ill take home first the  drivers of home were we  with this new pricing structure launch we updated the credit score model to a more recent model and part of the exercise you have to do is try and sort of map what sort of your old credit scores were and what you expect them to be under new credit scores and at the end of the day for both auto and home we just  we did  probably did not order enough retro credit scores and do enough work to make that a great estimate so we kind of  that put the base rate off where we expected it to be when we started quoting business the quotes were generally higher based on sort of the credit scores being a little different than we thought they would be under the new model the second thing for homeowners is we were higher in the higher coverage a amounts the majority of our business historically has been  and less coverage a and so the coverage a curve that we use we look at our own data but we also look at others so we picked a competitor and kind of adopted their coverage a curve but we had added a couple of variables that sort of overlap with higher coverage a like number of stories number of bathrooms that sort of thing so you could say were kind of double counting on high coverage a risks for homeowners that made them higher than we wanted to be on the auto side it was  in addition to credit score mapping over it was probably a tiering structure thing where less risks were going into our sort of better rated tiers than we expected because of the way we had set up some of the tiering mechanism so when we relaunched we sort of  we made some adjustments to that so things would get more evenly distributed across tiers as we thought they should be those were the drivers mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo and then larry on the feedback from the field kim jess myself paul our claims leader tacchetti our cio john petrucci our field agent service leader we all went out into the field we did  cities across  days and basically did about an hour of presentation and a complete hour of qa open qa where i actually stood in front of them and said i want to hear everything the good the bad and the ugly and especially the bad and the ugly because we want to hear from our customers what were doing well and what were not doing well technology conflict competitiveness and i will tell you that ive been doing this a long long long time and the overall feedback was very favorable the complaints we got was the rising auto rates at state auto obviously across other competitors as well we talked them through distracted driving and other drivers of that but that was negative two for the folks that had the technology platform in the  states they did say that yes its  the launch was a little bumpier than we wanted but they were very pleased with the work that our it and product team had done and the relaunch was being very well received our last state was colorado i stood in front of them and said please tell me whats wrong tell me whats wrong tell me something bad and we got  it was like a love fest now that does not suggest to us that we cant get better we certainly have challenges out there but in terms of transitioning to a digital space for the pc industry when youre first to market with this there is always that risk of acceptance right and so while there are still a few handful of agents who say well ive got customers who wont do business that way or i dont really like to do business that way the growing numbers of agents who are very enthusiastic about what were doing is very very encouraging were also seeing quite a shift in some of our agents as well were now seeing a larger group of new agents who are very supportive of this way of doing business so very pleased  it was very long but very successful tour so to speak  may    pm gmt stfc  q  state auto financial corp earnings call larry greenberg  janney  analyst have you heard anything that makes you rethink when your legacy book might be ready for this migration to digital mike larocco  state auto financial corporation  chairman president ceo we have  internally were building a plan there i think its going to vary a little bit by state let me give you an example not specific example but there are a handful of states where over the course of last  or  years there have been dumpster fires right i mean the rates were awful the systems terrible and the business has been running away well in those states im not as sensitive in to how we should worry about the existing book because its just been an ugly situation so in some states well probably go out and take a test drive of moving those inforce customers on to the new platform however that would be the minority in the majority of our states i dont have a very specific time frame i can say kind of  to  months postlaunch is what we kind of would like to be in that space but theres a lot of things we want to be super thoughtful about with the existing base theyre the customers that are driving all of our action and theyre very very important to us but nothing happened while we were out there to make us say oh my gosh we cant move them or we should move them faster but again the acceptance of it was encouraging that well be able to get folks that are currently on the old legacy systems on to the new digital system operator operator instructions and there are no further questions i now turn the call back over
