industry veteran and the metallica guitarist teamed up to build a thriving business  and how you can too by jeff haden jeff haden is a ghostwriter speaker linkedin influencer and contributing editor to inc jeffhaden contributing editor incjeffhaden write a comment credit getty images millions of wouldbe entrepreneurs dream of creating a new product or service and building a successful business but a small percentage actually do one reason so few people actually pursue their dreams is that the journey from idea to reality is seldom discussed making it seem like new products somehow magically appear thats why i talked with david karon the cofounder of khdk electronics a company he started with metallica lead guitarist kirk hammett to design and manufacture guitar pedals heres my interview with kirk about the genesis of khdk david and i talked about why they decided to start a company how they decided to make pedals how they found the perfect engineer and then the right manufacturing facility their building the business and a lot more no one runs an ad that says business partner wanted how did you and kirk join up originally i worked for us music they make products like washburn guitars and randall amps i was director of artist relations which meant i helped create signature products for musicians together we would draw up designs create tones we did all those things collaboratively that led to my relationship with kirk at first it was mostly just hanging out because artist relations should always start with building a relationship with the artist after about a year we started creating an amp and realized we spoke the same language as far as how to make the tones we hear in our heads come out we worked well together and it was a lot of fun later i left us music and moved to prague with my wife at one point metallica was playing in prague so we met for dinner and reminisced and remembered all the fun we had creating things and kirk said lets do something new together how did you settle on guitar pedals we had lots of options kirk is kirk so we definitely could have gone into guitars or amps but we didnt want to do that guitars and amps involve a lot of customer service much of it related to problems temperature changes affect guitars amps can be touchy shipping costs are high and the possibility for damage is fairly high and because of the nature of the components its really hard to manufacture each one perfectly we thought about it and realized that our interactions with customers were more likely to be negative instead of positive we want to build relationships instead of fix problems even though we love guitars and amps we decided going into that business just wasnt right for us what is right for us is pedals it was actually an easy decision because we both love pedals and how they can make the sonic possibilities almost limitless so you decide to make pedals how do you start our first task was to find an engineer who could help create and be a part of our vision we also wanted someone creative we didnt just want to tell that person what to do beyond that we also wanted to find an underdog some engineers are so famous within the industry its almost like they are their own brand because kirk is involved we could easily have gone to any number of established engineers but we wanted someone new and young and different we found antonin salva through a recommendation from our friend jason baskin a guitar technician who has worked for bands like smashing pumpkins guns n roses muse and the zac brown band antonin had built a rig for billy corrigan jason said this guy can create anything you guys want  and his ear is perfect so i set up a meeting with antonin in prague and we quickly found that our personalities fit some engineers can be more of a rock start than a rock star and we really wanted someone fun to work with antonin had everything we were looking how did you determine what you would do first while we had a lot of ideas the first pedal we decided to make was the no  overdrive it was something we really wanted to create because it was a tone we had in our heads for a long time if youre a touring musician and cant afford to fly all your gear you can use this pedal to replace some of it we also didnt want our first product to be derivative we wanted it to be something new but that doesnt mean we wont produce our own version of some classic pedals our ghoul screamer is a version of a tube screamer we dont hide behind marketing and pretend its totally new the ghoul screamer is our take on a classic pedal you say it was a tone you had in your heads but how do you translate what you hear in your head into language an engineer can work with thats why kirk and antonin and i work so well together somehow we can describe what were looking for in terms we all understand sometimes that means using historical references like an old marshall amp but with more mid sometimes you start making funny noises with your mouth however it works theres this language between gear heads that comes across plus kirk has so much expertise he can say theres too much midrange there and we need to pull k out he has years of experience to draw from and sometimes kirk just says do this and then go freaking crazy how long was the process from deciding to start a company to getting the first product to market the no  overdrive was a threeyear process i know that sounds long but it wasnt painful we knew going in that we would take our time so we could go to market with something that not only kirk loved but that other artists would loveplus theres a lot more involved than just coming up with a prototype we love parts schematics design build quality our pedals must be able to be manufactured effectively and efficiently fortunately our manufacturing team is great about telling us exactly what we can and cant get away with that raises a good point finding the right manufacturer is something a lot of entrepreneurs struggle with we definitely did originally we had our prototypes manufactured in china and the failure rate was  i had worked with that manufacturer in the past and working with a factory in china wasnt new to me in this case though it just didnt work that was a massive stress point we were just about to go to a trade show and the first shipment was dreadful so we took a step back creativity and innovation are definitely important but the most important thing is putting out a product that is as reliable as anything in the industry thats not just important for our customers thats important for us through some friends we found a familyrun factory in paducah kentucky their primary business was building speakers for the navy and for guitar amps but they were also manufacturing pedals we visited them and everything was a great fit for us from the way the factory was was run to the attitude of the people working there and theyre a small family business just like us they just love making great products and they care every pedal that goes out is tested by an actual guitar player they plug it in and test it before it goes our goal was to have  or less failure rate so far its been  thats the peace of mind that we were looking for when we started this we also appreciate that they can grow with us if we need  pedals they make  if we need  they make  manufacturing on demand  and with excellent quality control  is big for us because that lets us focus on our customers on developing new pedals and on building relationships with other artists we didnt go into this to deal with problems we went into this to create cool new stuff we hope musicians will love how does turning your ideas over to manufacturing work we give them schematics a physical prototype that antonin has built all the stuff they need that way when they pull their first unit off the line they can compare the handwired version to the final production version were in the process of doing that right now with a new pedal that will be another kirk pedal built specifically for metallicas new record well get the first manufacturing prototype soon distribution is also a huge factor many entrepreneurs fail simply because they cant get their products in front of consumers we chose not to sell them ourselves we chose to use a dealer network sure we could have put up an ecommerce website but the dealer network is an additional marketing channel and some of our dealers are such champions for our brand they really get what were doing but we do have sales reps and i handle sales as well and so far its working weve already exceeded our growth target for the first year our expectations were realistic and weve surpassed them and we continue to keep realistic expectations we want to grow slowly right now we only have four products five and six should come out before the end of the year were being patient and are waiting to have more products before we make a bigger push towards more retail we also think its important to build great relationships with our dealers if we started out with  dealers how would we ever know them all by their first names we want to know who are dealers are and have actual relationships with them how did you determine your pricing strategy and price points we dont want to price ourselves out of the existing market and we dont want to sacrifice on quality and we know that dealers have expectations  why would they carry your products if they cant make a reasonable return  and we wanted to meet those expectations so with all that in mind we decided to make less margin on each unit sold as we grow as a company profit isnt as important as growing the brand and creating loyal customers so for now our goal is to break even and we are keep in mind our longterm goal is to leave this company to our kids to run so were focused on slow steady growth plus we want to enjoy every minute of it instead of just putting out a bunch of products as fast as we can and making a lot of money and then bailing we want to build a business that lasts and that drives the decisions we make at some point will you add other artists to your creative process we already are and we have an advantage where thats concerned because kirk and i cover both ends of the artist relationship spectrum together weve been there done that and know how it looks were extremely artistfriendly because we know how to help people create the sounds they want to hear the key is to not limit the artists imagination and creativity and then try to figure out how to fit that into a manufacturing process and a product price that makes sense that is sometimes a challenge but it can also be pretty rewarding i like bridging that gap so yes we have some cool collaborations coming not only is doing that a lot of fun it will also help build our brand and our business i would think that doing this with kirk is both extremely positive and yet has a negative side hes a metal guy but youre not just making pedals for metal guitarists that does create a little of a doubleedged sword for example some dealers in nashville might think were strictly a metal company  so we do have that perception to overcome but of course thats wrong as a musician you listen to everything so when we create our pedals we think about versatility and about any guitar player using our pedals not just a metal head so while kirk is a partner were definitely not just metal it is funny sometimes though if we put out a pedal that isnt metal some of kirks fans want to know why we would put out a pedal like that i dont know any great guitarists who can only play one style of music let alone enjoy only playing one style of music what they might be known best for isnt the only thing they like speaking of like whats the most fun part of all this coming up with the ideas kirk and i and antonin dreaming and talking and figuring out whats next each product launch is also fun but the leadup to that is the cool part the launch is actually a little nervewracking because youve put your heart and soul into something and youre sending it out into the world fortunately weve gotten great reviews but still the really fun part is the round table antonin kirk and myself imagining something and then then plugging a guitar in and saying wow that actually happened what has been the hardest part it hasnt been harder or easier its about what i thought it would be we keep our expectations low so we can be pleasantly surprised ive used my previous career experience as a guide for what not to do and for a sense of how the business would go patience is key you cant expect immediate gratification and when youre patient that lets you be open to some really great stuff we have some great dealers some great customers some great relationships with other artists its easy to forget how great people can be when youre just stuck in your bubble were breaking even right now and that makes us happy and were even happier because of how much fun this has turned out to be the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own
