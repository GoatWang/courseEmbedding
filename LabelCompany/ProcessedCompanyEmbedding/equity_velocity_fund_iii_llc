questions q what types of companies are eligible to apply to the vf k competition a we are focused on technology companies software hardware science and social impact businesses that use technology as a core aspect of their business such that the business is not possible without that technology service companies such as consulting businesses are not eligible q why does velocity focus on tech companies growth – startups should be focused on growth as the primary objective and it is the search for a business that can grow at astounding rates that drive startups read paul graham’s essay on growth expertise – the university of waterloo is wellknown around the world for being able to build incredibly talented people with tech skills from a variety of programs we want to leverage those skills and a passion for solving different problems to help those students build their own companies ecosystem – the local community has cultivated an amazing ecosystem that supports tech companies including organizations like communitech the accelerator centre and others although velocity provides a ton of great services it is critical that we also leverage the support of other programs q what’s the difference between the velocity fund k and k a the k focuses on early stage startups still cutting their teeth in the startup world as an individual or as part of a small team these students want to gain experience pitching and receive feedback from the greater startup community any waterloo student from any faculty can showcase their work at the velocity fund k event once they have qualified by winning a finalist slot at one of our k qualifiers the goal of velocity fund k is to help a team get their business started the business must be techbased and a working prototype is strongly encouraged to help demonstrate your ability to execute when a team wins they should have a fully formed cohesive team ready to execute on the business q what types of companies are eligible to apply to the vf k competition a all companies are eligible to apply to this competition there is no general area of expertise that we require – your business can be a service or a product in fact you can simply pitch a great idea without actually having the productservice finalized – it’s a great way to get feedback and experience pitching q do you have to compete in the k qualifier to
