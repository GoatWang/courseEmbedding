personally knew ms chea professionally for years she provided me a glowing reference of ms chea saying such things as “i admire her competence she is very good at what she does… and she is honest…she has integrity” i have known katherine for a number of years and occasionally have breakfast with herkatherine sold me on ms chea but it took months katherine started in december  i did not want to declare bankruptcy i thought it was a personal insult to say that i could not pay my bills as agreed endeavoring to avoid bankruptcy i negotiated a phenomenal reduction in interest charges from five of my six creditors and i paid per agreement for almost eighteen months but after exhausting all other financial resourcesasking for loans from my family friends former coworkers and my direct supervisor and my churchi had to make an unwanted decision but even then i did not approach an attorney i first tried to find a credit counselor to negotiate a principal reduction and reduction in interest however i soon learned that the people i would have to work with lacked the integrity i require they wanted me to pay them and they would pay the creditors but they would not guarantee that my bills would be paid in a timely fashion nevertheless i still did not want to declare bankruptcy i tried to negotiate a reduction of principal and interest with my creditors that too failed as i could not meet their financial demandsi tried to get a second mortgage on my home for  when my credit rating was good over  i failed to get it because i had one questionable payment that did not meet minimum payment that was  days past due for  in addition i lacked an additional  per month income katherine kept at me saying to file for bankruptcy with ms chea i finally did late last year ms chea comes across very experienced and very competent as an attorney she clearly explained what i had to provide her in terms of documents that must be submitted and the time window that would be desired in light that housing prices are rising we addressed that fact that my gift to a friend of my thunderbird about two years ago may cause problems in timing she showed concern about my precarious financial condition by providing me a coupon or code to use to get a free legally required credit counseling session i believe ms chea to be highly dedicated and committed to her job that she possesses the required drive and enthusiasm and has an excellent work ethic she pays attention to detail in addition she has a high degree of integrity and a cheerful personality is charismatic focused and determined outgoing and friendly i feel very confident that she will be extremely successful in our hearingon the occasion that i did not take her advice it was at my peril fortunately it was a small losssincerelypaul ma governmentthe law office of david w bonillaitsmeagain ratedi was in a pickle i was in an altercation with my girlfriend in placer county i knew i needed help with the intricacies of the law and i needed a tough lawyer who would not belittle me take my money and run or not fight tooth and nail for me i contacted david bonilla due to the reviews i had read online at that time  he was brutally honest after his assessment of the situation two years in jail  years of probation  days of a work program and a felony charge in my mind my career was over however after speaking to the da david had managed to lower the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor he also persuaded the da to reduce the work program to  days and the probation to informal after a year of going back and forth with a very stubborn judge and the probation department he persuaded the county to enable me to complete a batterers program online this specific step online program was essential as any charge curtailed any threat towards my career and i could continue to travel for work it was also the very first time in the history of placer county judgements that this was allowedmr bonilla is an outstanding lawyer of whom went above and beyond he kept me in the loop in every turn and he fought hard for me he is a lawyer who hates to lose and that is why im writing this review his passion for winning came through and his knowledge of the law is exemplary it was because of his knowledge he actually checkmated the da and judge in allowing me to complete an online batterers course and it was painfully obvious that the judge did not want to allow it i will complete the batterers course and the work program after a year and a half i will use mr bonillas services to have my case dismissed and thereafter expungedi have and will continue to recommend david bonilla to everyone and anyone who has been accused of a crimethe law offices of christopher

the results he felt he could produce quick on his feet professional and found him very through from the beginning from beginning to end on one occasion frank was unable to go to the hearing due to a scheduling conflict and had one of the firms attorney’s step in immediately to keep the case moving forward who walked into the court at a moment’s notice with sound knowledge of the case and her role

summer involving the partition of a luxury waterfront property with multiple familial ownersas the listing agent for the parcel i was primarily responsible for representing the four owners and interacting with their individual attorneys frequently representing two of the four owners bob harris and his associate sonya were consummate professionals from the get  go courteous and conscientious bob is also highly intellectual and thoughtful when working within a group of individuals with varied goals in real estate its common for multiple family members to differ in opinion on the division of assets bob and sonya were invariably diplomatic and discreet when confronted with emotional discord between the parties this quality proved invaluable in reaching a ratified contract and working through a lengthy and complicated escrow that ultimately resulted in a successful sale of the property bob and sonya not only attained the goal set by their clients and mine but they did it with grace and humor which i appreciated immensely a little levity goes a long way in life and in businesswithout hesitation i recommend the services of harris law firm and i look forward to continuing my relationship with them on both a professional and personal leveldougherty  associatesjennifer h ratedas an attorney myself i can appreciate a smoothrunning legal team i definitely found that here with frank and his team from the alwaysresponsive staff to the readilyavailable associates willing to jump in on a moments notice but i cannot emphasize enough what an expert frank is in his field within  months he was able to turn my case around without going into detail an ex husband willing to fabricate allegations of mental disorder to get the upper hand in custody and an extremely contentious opposing counsel going to hearing on every minute detail i balked at retaining him at first given the slightly higher rates compared to my previously retained counsel but after  years of kicking the can down the road and delaying tactics from opposing counsel i realized i couldnt afford to not retain him  months on my case only delayed due to the court continuing the trial due to a backedup docket and we had a fair outcome i cant say enough about this man the real gem was his previous experience as a family law forensic psychologist which allowed him to quickly unravel the bs reports of our courtordered evaluator he restored my confidence reunified my family and put my life back together thank you so much frankdougherty  associatesggbrown ratedone of the very best decisions i ever made in my life was hiring frank dougherty to represent me in a bitter custody fight for my young son family and friends said i was crazy to pursue custody when i had no chance of success i had already gone through four attorneys and was like a boxer on the mat looking up at a nine count frank took charge and the situation changed faster than i could ever have imagined franks background as a psychologistand frequent expert witnesswas invaluable in setting up the case for my being the custodial parentand ultimately left me with sole legal custody of my soneven after i had moved out of california to nevada it was stressfuland we had to fight it out in court but thankfullythe best interests of my son were served having a child is the greatest experience of my lifeand i truly believe that i owe my present loving relationship with my son to that one fateful decision to ask frank to take my seemingly hopeless case frank is a very wise manand i could not recommend him and his office
