cybersecurity public safety systems kent statler executive profiles find out how kent statler’s value system has helped him achieve success in multiple roles kent statler remembers well the first day of summer vacation and the long list of things that needed to be accomplished prior to the start of the next school year building fences pouring concrete and baling hay weren’t exactly the way a high school boy wanted to spend his time away from the classroom but in the early s working hard and working together on the family farm was simply a way of life three decades have passed since one of his father’s infamous todo lists has been compiled but the lessons statler and his older siblings learned during those hot summer days in eastern iowa continue to guide him in his current role as executive vice president and chief operating officer of commercial systems “a lot of who you are comes from your parents” said statler “i am definitely my own person but my strong value system my resultsdriven approach and my desire to make a difference were without a doubt instilled by my dad and mom” climbing the corporate laddera graduate of the university of northern iowa in cedar falls with a bachelor of arts degree in production management and economics statler’s career with rockwell collins began on the production floor the day after he received his college diploma “i graduated on a sunday and started working on a monday” recalled statler who married his high school sweetheart julie the summer before his senior year in college “i think being married and having our first child on the way had something to do with that quick transition from college life to the real world” during the first eight years of his career statler rotated through several positions that provided him with insight to the operations side of our business from production assembly and test foreman to production control manager and industrial engineering manager statler learned more about our company and our products with each new challenge he faced in  his climb up the corporate ladder continued when he became one of our company’s first integrated product team leaders two years later the career path led him to coralville iowa where he assumed responsibilities as plant manager “i’ve always enjoyed leading large diverse organizations and i get really excited about taking people to places they don’t believe they can go” said statler “the experiences i had during those first  years taught me a lot and really helped prepare me for that next step” as part of an enterprisewide job rotation plan statler returned to cedar rapids in  and entered the world of collins aviation services cas which today is part of rockwell collins’ international and service solutions as the vice president of maintenance operations he was responsible for our service centers and services bases which are located around the world with a vast amount of experience and a master of business administration degree in hand — which he earned in  from the university of iowa — statler was now ready to make one of the largest leaps of his career surrounding himself with talented leadersin january  at the age of  he became vice president of lean electronics reporting directly to clay jones who was then chairman president and chief executive officer from there statler served as the senior vice president of operations before then assuming responsibilities for rockwell collins services as executive vice president in february  he was named to his current role as executive vice president and chief operating officer of commercial systems in his current role he is responsible for leading the commercial systems business which produces aviation electronics and communications for the air transport business aviation and regional airline markets  “i’ve definitely kept my competitive spirit over the years but i’ve learned along the way that i can’t succeed on my own” said statler “if you surround yourself with high potential people and provide them with stretch objectives they will help you succeed” importance of familyin addition to surrounding himself with outstanding leaders statler admits he would not be the man he is today if it weren’t for his wife julie and their three grown children — jessica ben and joshua — helping him maintain a healthy balance between his career and his personal life “without a doubt my family is the most important thing in my life” said statler “my wife and i have been married for  years and we dated for five years before that watching our kids grow up has been so rewarding — it’s something i would never change” even though their kids are grown he and his wife enjoy spending time with them whenever possible but the couple also is discovering that life as emptynesters is quite pleasant as well they now have more opportunity to go out for dinner – just the two of them traveling also is something the couple enjoys doing together especially internationally leaving a legacy behindeven though the company veteran is still a fairly young man statler also realizes that retirement isn’t as far away as it once used to be “i’ve been with this company for  years” he said “i can’t believe how quickly the time has passed” when the day comes that he is able to trade in his daily work responsibilities for a permanent tee time on his favorite area golf course he simply wants to look back on his career and hope he made a positive impact on those he’s leaving behind “i really enjoy being part of something special” said statler “the people i have had and will continue to have the opportunity to work with are really the legacy i hope to leave behind if our business continues to grow and run smoothly after i’m gone then i have succeeded in my mission as a leader” corporate bio kent statler   rockwell collins  kent statler  awin content from aviation week   connect with us twitterfacebookyoutubelinkedin store subscribe rss newsletter
