lily duckler lily spent her childhood growing up all around the world – from indonesia to angola and the uk – so moving to china with david was no big change lily picked up all her chinese in the tea fields working at the same time as a teacher at qingdao university lily got extensive taste training from all the farmer friends we work with today  after returning to america lily followed her second passion working as a librarian and studying video editing and illustration while working at a post production house in minneapolis when verdant started to grow lily decided to work full time with david on sharing her love of tea and the stories of the farmers she counts as her friends she spends much of her time now working with customers illustrating articles answering all of the questions we get across the internet and leading local tastings when we are in minneapolis mn when she isn’t brewing tea or working with tea lily is reading books making videos or singing  wei wei ren weiwei is an incredibly gifted taster and tea scout with family near laoshan village and a father whose lifelong goal is to track down the best tieguanyin in china  though she is young weiwei has the most formidable palate of anyone we know weiwei met david at qingdao university and taught him most of his chinese now weiwei is running verdant’s headquarters in jimo china near laoshan in collaboration with tea farmer he qingqing she is working hard every day to make sure that every package ships with the freshest tea possible she checks every order to make sure they are perfect excited to share tea across the world in her free time weiwei teaches chinese to korean students in jimo and hopes to travel to inner mongolia to further her teaching experience  her favorite food is mala tang soup and she will travel miles and miles to the smallest holeinthewall restaurants to find the best  she hopes to visit america soon and see the growing tea culture here   kelsey henderson kelsey met david and lily in the minneapolis art world since verdant’s first office was in the traffic zone center for visual arts while working as a printmaker and studying art kelsey joined verdant tea in  initially packing orders she quickly brought her creative eye to the business becoming verdant’s designer and illustrator working with lily on photography mailers websites and more now kelsey juggles managing verdant’s customer service and design kelsey is one of those rare people who loves both good tea and good coffee teaching the rest of the team about what makes a good cup and even sharing her love of fine scotch   outside of verdant kelsey is an artist and printmaker working in minneapolis lauren johnson lauren started at verdant tea in  to fulfill orders lauren quickly became verdant’s fulfillment master helping us all become more organized and far more accurate now she is the logistics manager for verdant tea and all of our partner businesses including prohibition kombucha and tree fort soda lauren helps verdant’s brewing businesses stay organized and on track source better materials and make better product while organizing daytoday production and wholesale operations she works directly with our team in china to make sure every order is perfect and ships quickly though new to minneapolis lauren spends her free time volunteering at many community events in the neighborhood and working to promote bike riding and alternative transportation    wang huimin wang huimin met david back in  teaching him everything he knows about tea ceremony and about tasting tieguanyin she grew up near anxi making tea an inseparable part of her life wang huimin has run several successful tea businesses in china and knows small farmers across the country from her travels wang huimin now works directly with verdant tea by scounting tea wares and finding the most beautiful pieces in collaboration with mr chen in xiamen she also regularly visits our partners in yunnan fujian and zhejiang as often as possible and makes sure they can plan on what to set aside for verdant and pack up to order each day when wang huimin is not brewing tea she is learning everything she can about fine spirits cooking incense buddhism precious stones and basically anything she hears about wang huimin’s favorite thing in the world is to learn new things and experience new cultures she had an incredible time visiting our tasting room in minneapolis and hopes to visit america again soon geoffrey reiff geoffrey began to explore the world of chinese tea after first encountering david duckler at a minneapolis tea shop recognizing the extensive knowledge with which david spoke about tea geoffrey decided to ask him a fortuitous question before leaving the shop “so how did you become a tea man” this became the starting point for what developed into an hourslong discussion of tea chinese philosophy literature translation and aesthetics among other things a good friendship soon developed over the course of many tea gatherings geoffrey was exposed to the methods of gongfu brewing and experiences of flavor and aroma that were previously unimaginable the appreciation of fine tea quickly became a great passion for geoffrey and eventually forged an important place in his daily lifestyle when asked about the possibility of working for verdant tea there was no need to hesitate for geoffrey the question was already answered resigning from his business as an independent web developer geoffrey now works in all aspects of business operations to help take verdant tea to the next level and is happy to be working in the service of a product that he loves geoffrey is now a coowner of verdant tea directing the online experience and making sure that everything works behind the scenes geoffrey is particularly fond of stripstyle oolongs from wuyi and feng huang when not drinking tea he enjoys dancing argentine tango rock climbing studying history and reading literature   david duckler david came to tea not through business but through a deep engagement with classical chinese culture  schooled as a translator of chinese fiction and poetry david has spent much time in china on various research grants from the freeman foundation and the fulbright program  if david is not off sourcing tea he might be found translating novels like the mountain stairway by tibetan author alai years ago david was working with an advisor at qingdao university on a translation project and happened to walk past a tea market every day  in exploring chinese tea for the first time david immediately saw the traditions preserved from china’s classical heritage  david couldn’t help but go back for another year to study tea in more depth training under a tea master and working in the fields collecting folk tales about tea from the farmers this extremely handson experience gave david the chance to make lasting friendships with farmers across china and exposed him to some of the most obscure and wonderful tea in the world  david returned to america extremely indebted to these farmers for the knowledge they passed on and realized that the only way to pay them back was to share that knowledge and tea with the rest of the world  thus verdant tea was born verdant tea continues to work directly with the same farmers that david met years ago and as a result of these friendships we are able to bring in teas that have never before left china in david’s extra free time he enjoys cooking as a second passion attending culinary school and playing with food  he also has a real weakness for collecting yixing teapots  david’s favorite author is jorge louis borges with italo calvino coming in second   huimin wang  profile english  about products  pricing products pricing free
