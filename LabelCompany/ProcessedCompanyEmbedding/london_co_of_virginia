unsuccessful and expensive settlement often referred to as the lost colony made the english crown wary of trying again it was not until  that the virginia company of london received a charter from the newlycrowned king james i following the precedent set by other companies such as the moscovy company and east india company the virginia company was a jointstock company which sold shares all who purchased shares at a cost of £ s shared in the success or failure of the venture the virginia company was formed both to bring profit to its shareholders and to establish an english colony in the new world the company under the direction of its treasurer sir thomas smith was instructed to colonize land between the th and st northern parallel in december  the virginia companys three ships containing  men and boys set sail on may   these first settlers selected the site of jamestown island as the place to build their fort in addition to survival the early colonists had another pressing mission to make a profit for the stockholders of the virginia company although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees they realized there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home early industries such as glass manufacture pitch and tar production and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the lands fertility however the settlers could not devote as much time as the virginia company would have liked to their financial responsibilities they were too busy trying to survive within the threesided fort erected on the banks of the james the settlers quickly discovered that they were first and foremost employees of the virginia company of london following instructions of the men appointed by the company to rule them in exchange the laborers were armed and received clothes and food from the common store after seven years they were to receive land of their own the gentlemen who provided their own armor and weapons were to be paid in land dividends or additional shares of stock initially the colonists were governed by a president and sevenmember council selected by the king leadership problems quickly erupted and jamestowns first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness indian assaults poor food and water supplies and class strife when captain john smith became virginias third president he proved the strong leader that the colony needed industry flourished and relations with chief powhatans people improved in  the virginia company received its second charter which allowed the company to choose its new governor from amongst its shareholders investment boomed as the company launched an intensive recruitment campaign over  colonists set sail for virginia between march  and march  unfortunately for these new settlers sir thomas gates virginias deputy governor bound for the colony was shipwrecked in bermuda and did not assume his new post until  when he arrived he found only a fraction of the colonists had survived the infamous starving time of  all too soon the mother country learned of virginias woeful state the result was predictable financial catastrophe for the company many new subscribers reneged payment on their shares and the company became entangled in dozens of court cases on top of these losses the company was forced to incur further debt when it sent hundreds more colonists to virginia there was little to counter this crushing debt no gold had been found in virginia trading commodities produced by exploitation of the raw materials found in the new world were minimal attempts at producing glass pitch tar and potash had been barely profitable and regrettably such commodities could be had far more cheaply on the other side of the atlantic increasingly bad publicity political infighting and financial woes led the virginia company to organize a massive advertising campaign the company plastered street corners with tempting broadsheets published persuasive articles and even convinced the clergy to preach of the virtues of supporting colonization before the company was dissolved it would publish  books and pamphlets promoting the virginia venture to make shares more marketable the virginia company changed its sales pitch instead of promising instant returns and vast profits for investors the company exploited patriotic sentiment and national pride a stockholder was assured that his purchase of shares would help build the might of england to make her the superpower she deserved to be the heathen natives would be converted to the proper form of christianity the church of england people out of work could find employment in the new world the standard of living would increase across the nation how could any good patriotic englander resist the english rose to the bait the gentry wished to win favor by proving its loyalty to the crown the growing middle class also saw stock purchasing as a way to better itself but the news was not all good although the population of jamestown rose high settler mortality kept profits unstable by  the companys debts had soared to over £ a third charter provided a shortterm resolution to the virginia companys problems the company was permitted to run a lottery as a fundraising venture other attractive features of the charter allowed virginias assembly to act as the colonys legislature and also added  leagues of ocean to the colonys holdings which would include bermuda as part of virginia but the colony was still on shaky ground until john rolfes successful experiment with tobacco as a cash crop provided a way to recoup financially unfortunately by  the virginia company suffered further adversity the original settlers were owed their land and stock shares initial investors at home were owed their dividends the company was forced to renege on its cash promises instead distributing acre lots in payment the next year the company instituted the headright system a way to bring more settlers to virginia investors and residents were able to acquire land in paying the passage of new settlers in most cases these newcomers spent a period of time in servitude on the investors land sir edwin sandys a leading force in the virginia company strongly supported the headright system for his goal was a permanent colony which would enlarge british territory relieve the nations overpopulation and expand the market for english goods sir thomas smith as the companys treasurer had a different dream the virginia companys mission was to trade and to make a profit in the end it was sandys vision which prevailed when he became treasurer of the company in  he moved forward to populate the colony and earn a protective status for the tobacco crop which had become the cash crop of virginia at the same time he urged colonists to diversify their plantings and thus become less reliant on only one staple the colonists ignored this advice to their later dismay in  the company was in trouble unpaid dividends and increased use of lotteries had made future investors wary the company debt was now over £ worried virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic treasurer sandys who warned that the company cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves march  the companys and the colonys situation went from dire to disastrous when the powhatan indians staged an uprising which wiped out a quarter of the european population of virginia when a fourth charter severely reducing the companys ability to make decisions in the governing of virginia was proposed by the crown subscribers rejected it king james i forthwith changed the status of virginia in  virginia was now a royal colony to be administered by a governor appointed by the king the virginia assembly finally received royal approval in  and this form of government with governor and assembly would oversee the colony of virginia until  excepting only the years of the english commonwealth the virginia company of london so far as achieving its aims as a profitable stockholding company was a dismal failure despite numerous creative and desperate attempts to make virginia stable and financially successful the investors never achieved a profit while the colonists suffered from the factionalism and mismanagement by the administration on the other side of the atlantic but other motives for establishing for establishing virginia were achieved englands territory was increased vastly and the new land could be settled and its natural resources harvested spanish colonial enterprise in the new world was challenged englands laws language and religion were transplanted to a new place laying the foundations for

sir george somers until being dissolved in  and made a royal colony native american relationshipsedit the instructions issued to sir thomas gates on november   called for a forcible conversion of native americans to anglicanism and their subordination to the colonial administration the records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to give adventurers a clearness and satisfaction a public debate where catholics and neutrals might attack them whereas catholic arguments would be in support of spanish legal claims to the new world under the treaty of tordesillas it was feared that the neutral penadversaries might cast scruples into our conscience by criticising the lawfulness of the plantation it was decided to forego such a publication of a justification in  sir edward coke in his capacity as lord chief justice offered a ruling in calvins case that went beyond the issue at hand whether a scotsman could seek justice at an english court coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with england and friendly aliens those from nations in league with england friendly aliens could have recourse to english courts but he also ruled that with all infidels ie those from nonchristian nations there could be no peace and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between

propaganda war alderman robert johnson published nova britannia in  which compared native americans to wild animalsheardes of deere in a forest while it portrayed the powhatan as peaceloving it

faction the company began to turn a profit after  when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to english tastes than the native tobacco tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony and settlers were urged to cultivate more the colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high in  the second anglopowhatan war erupted its origins are disputed english apologists for the company say that opchanacanough initiated the war robert williams a stcentury native american law professor argues that opchanacanough had secured concessions from governor yeardley which the company would not acceptcitation needed thus opchanacanoughs attack on april   may have been a preemptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrivedcitation needed in about a day the powhatan killed  of  colonists destroying some outlying settlements the virginia company quickly published an account of this attack it was steeped in calvinist theology of the time the massacre was the work of providence in that it was justification for the destruction of the powhatan and building english settlements over their former towns new orders from the london company

virginia foundation for the humanitites in partnership with library of virginia search go coat of arms of the virginia company virginia company of london contributed by brendan wolfe the virginia company of london was a jointstock company chartered by king james i in  to establish a colony in north america such a venture allowed the crown to reap the benefits of colonization—natural resources new markets for english goods leverage against the spanish—without bearing the costs investors meanwhile were protected from catastrophic losses in the event of the projects failure the company established a settlement at jamestown in  and over the next eighteen years the crown granted the company two new charters democratizing its governance and reforming its financial model what began as an enterprise of investors seeking a dividend was funded a decade later almost exclusively by a public lottery by  the company had found a way to use its most abundant resource—land—to tempt settlers to pay their own passage from england to the colony and then after arrival to pay the company a quitrent or fee to use the land still the virginia company and the colony it oversaw struggled to survive disease mismanagement indian attacks and factionalism in london all took a toll until in  the privy council launched an investigation into the companys finances a year later the companys charter was revoked and the king assumed direct control of virginia more in this entry first charter  second charter  third charter  great charter  companys end time line further reading map this entryplot this entrys geographic highlights on a map map itshare itadd to my virginia   first charter  king james iin  james i issued a royal charter to adventurers a term that referred to both investors and settlers in the virginia company of london a jointstock company to make habitation plantation and to deduce a colony of sundry of our people into that part of america commonly called virginia the virginia company actually consisted of two groups of investors the virginia company of plymouth and the virginia company of london the king authorized the latter to settle on the american coast between  and  degrees latitude while the plymouth investors were directed to lands to the north the virginia company of plymouth planted a colony at sagadahoc in presentday maine in august  but it was abandoned the following springa jointstock company consisted of investors who pooled resources to fund an enterprise and if it was successful shared the profits using such an arrangement to fund colonial ventures proved to be attractive both to the crown and to investors companies allowed queen elizabeth and later king james to reap the benefits of colonization without incurring the substantial costs in  the crown was in debt and short on both money and credit to invest in financially risky projects and because france and spain had claimed much of the north american coast planting colonies there was politically risky especially for king james who was determined to ease tensions with spain but putting such work in the hands of a company allowed the crown to distance itself should a crisis arisethe benefits of a jointstock company were no less pronounced for the investors a company allowed investors to distribute their losses more widely in the event of failure this promoted innovation by reducing individual costs and thereby encouraging more risk a company also allowed investors to negotiate their charter as a group providing them more leverage and making the crown responsible to a larger entity in theory this resulted in the crowns being less likely to renege on its supportthe economists douglass c north and robert paul thomas have argued that jointstock companies rewarded hard work and initiative rather than royal favor and helped transform europe into a global economic power englands first jointstock company the company of merchant adventurers was chartered in  to find a northeastern passage around scandinavia to china in  it became the muscovy company which traded with russia in  england was home to about ten jointstock companies including the east india company which had been chartered in  and was led by the london merchant sir thomas smytheotley hallsmythe was an early investor in the virginia company of london and bartholomew gosnold whose wife was smythes cousin one of its chief recruiters gosnold brought in his own cousin edward maria wingfield as well as captain john smith other investors included military men like sir thomas gates and sir george somers the minister and geographer richard hakluyt the younger sir william wade lieutenant of the tower of london sir francis popham son and heir of lord chief justice john popham and sir walter cope a member of parliament from westminsterthe companys goals combined commercial religious and national interests the crown authorized the investors to found a colony but their primary mission may have been to explore and fortify the coastline as a way to protect english shipping from the spanish merchants like smythe also hoped to find a trade route through america to china others subscribed to hakluyts case for colonization outlined at the time sir walter raleigh was funding the roanoke voyages the english protestants could convert the indians thus preventing them from being converted by the spanish they could exploit the areas natural resources they could resettle englands excess population they could create a new market for english goods and they could use the colony as political and commercial leverage against the spanishchristopher newportthe initial terms of investment in the virginia company of london are unclear investors may have bought fiveyear terminable stock meaning that the company promised to dispense profits in  with the possibility of reinvestment its also possible that each of captain christopher newports five voyages to jamestown represented a separate investment overseen by the company the company—both its london and plymouth investors—was governed by his majestys council for virginia composed of thirteen investors who had been appointed by the king and had sworn to serve his interests the company council in turn appointed a sevenman council to carry out company instructions in virginia with council members electing from their own a president when that position proved too weak to keep the colony in order the crown in  appointed sir thomas gates to serve as governor second charter  sir thomas smythe a new english colony established its beachhead at jamestown in  and by  the virginia company of london—running low on money while its colonists faced resistance from the indians of tsenacomoco—had decided that its arrangements for governance and investment needed an overhaul a new royal charter issued on may   divested the king of some of his power investors now elected a treasurer to lead the company with the position being held first by sir thomas smythe they also elected council members although their choices were still subject to the kings veto and still required to swear loyalty to the kings interestsby  the council had swelled to fifty members and included elites such as the philosopher and essayist sir francis bacon sir oliver cromwell a member of parliament and uncle of the future lord protector henry wriothesley third earl of southampton a patron of william shakespeare sir humphrey weld the lord mayor of london and james montague the lord bishop of bath and wells investors met in a weekly court and assembly and in a quarterly great and general court the former dealt with minor matters while the latter elected councilors and company officials considered trade issues and land grants and issued company and colony lawsunder the new charter virginia company stock sold for £ s per share for a sevenyear term the dividend to be paid in  would include a grant of land in addition to a share of any cash profit earned as the company was cash poor the payments in  were made in land alone when approaching potential investors the company emphasized that the purchase of stock earned shareholders not only a stake in the ventures success but also a voice in the companys governance it was an appeal designed for a broad swath of britons not only leading merchants and military menquo fata feruntthe initial stock sales may have netted as much as £ but then the company was hit with two pieces of devastating news first in  the sea venture carrying sir thomas gates the colonys new governor was mistakenly believed to have been lost at sea after landing at bermuda gates and his men spent the winter building two new ships they finally arrived at jamestown in the spring of  only to discover a few ragged survivors of the starving time thomas west twelfth baron de la warr whom the company had appointed to replace gates managed to save the colony but when gates returned to london late in  his report of the colonys dire conditions served as the second piece of bad newsthe virginia company already faced difficulty collecting money owed by those who had purchased their stock on installments it was now an open question whether the company should even attempt to continue in december  the company council published a true and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the plantation begun in virginia a frank appeal to its investors for patience and loyalty following the good news of the sea venture passengers survival lord robert rich a council member published newes from virginia the lost flocke triumphant —one of many efforts to mythologize the wreck and use its story to make money for the company third charter  map of bermudaon march   king james granted the virginia company of london a new charter its third primarily so it could extend the boundaries of virginia to include bermuda then called the somers or summer islands in order to facilitate the islands colonization the crown permitted the virginia company to form a special jointstock venture under the companys auspices in  the somers isles company became independent of the virginia company but it was also led by sir thomas smythe and its list of investors was nearly identicallike those before it the third charter dealt with issues of governance and finance the power to elect all officers of the company and the colony to admit new members to the company and to draft company and colony laws was transferred from the council to a socalled general assembly composed of all investors the move which democratized even further the workings of the company was again intended as an appeal to investors across oftenrigid class lines the charter also authorized lotteries to raise money for the company the first great standing lottery began in march  for a ticket price of s d players earned an opportunity to win a portion of £ worth of prizes including a fayre plate valued at £ the drawing originally planned for the end of may was postponed until the end of june because of unsold tickets and rumors of corruption similar problems beset the little standing lottery which ran from the summer of  until june  and sold tickets for d the second great standing lottery also began during the summer of  and sold lots for s the drawing was held on november  while these lotteries were not substantial financial successes they nevertheless provided almost the sole means of support for the company in  the company instituted socalled running lotteries rather than build up to a final drawing running lotteries allowed purchasers to immediately draw lots which either indicated prizes or were blank the running lotteries were operated by two company men gabriel barbor and lott peere who traveled from town to town and worked to create goodwill with local authorities by bestowing gifts to ensure the lotterys credibility the lots were mixed in the presence of city elders and drawn by a child in  a running lottery in leicester lasted six weeks forty thousand lots were available for sale at d each with  prizes at stake the companys profit may have exceeded £—more than the cost of furnishing an entire ship to jamestownin may  the virginia company reported £ in lottery earnings for the previous year out of £ in total cash for the company and the company expected to reap another £ the next year which would cover not quite half of the companys projected £ in expenses while the running lotteries were very profitable they were plagued like their predecessors by claims that people were being cheated out of their money and that the poor were only being made poorer in the house of commons on february   sir lionel cranfield spoke for many i am of the company of virginia but i hear these lotteries do beggar impoverish every country they come into let virginia lose rather than england the king banned the lotteries soon after great charter  on november   the virginia company of londons two top officers sir thomas smythe and sir edwin sandys drafted a set of instructions to the colonys newly appointed governor sir george yeardley this document often referred to as the great charter concerned itself—like the three royal charters before it—with finance and at least where the colony was concerned governance rather than seek to sell shares or depend entirely on lotteries the company proposed to fund itself through a resource it already had in abundance land by  the companys debt had swelled to about £ and officials hoped to find a way to entice settlers to pay their own way to virginia thus relieving the company of one of its chief expenses they found it in the headright system through which the company promised fifty acres of land for each person who paid his or her own passage or any other persons passage to virginia the settler then agreed to pay the company a quitrent of one shilling per year for every fifty acres the company also used land to defray another big cost funding the government rather than tax colonists the company granted its officers in virginia land and tenants including slaves and indentured servants to work the land the governor for instance received  acres and  tenants the treasurer  acres and  tenantslawes divine morall and martiall ampc the company had struggled to convince some people that virginia was an acceptable place for an englishman to live tales of an exceedingly strict regime under the lawes divine morall and martiall were hurting the companys reputation as a partial response to this the virginia company authorized the creation of of council of state and general assembly the formers appointed advisors and the latters elected burgesses would more widely distribute power in the colony providing investorcolonists a greater stake in the enterprise for which they risked their livesat about the same time virginia company officials also sought to restore investor confidence through a series of reforms in london the treasurer elected by company members at the easterseason quarter court could now serve a maximum of just three oneyear terms in addition the treasurer could no longer simultaneously lead another company as smythe had led the east india company the somers isles company was excepted from this rule to improve record keeping and to make the companys inner workings more transparent for investors new provisions added a secretary a bookkeeper a husband accountant and a bedel messenger the company also authorized a sixteenman council to assist the deputy treasurer in running the company from day to day finally an auditors office was created it consisted of seven members two of whom were required to be councilors the office was charged with reviewing both current and in what turned out to be a significant development past accounts companys end sir edwin sandysmany of these reforms were created under the leadership of sir thomas smythe but became associated with sir edwin sandys who was elected the virginia companys treasurer on april   at the time three large factions of investors dominated the company one led by smythe represented wealthy merchants who were not afraid of shunning shortterm rewards in favor of a longterm investment the second faction led by lord robert rich and his son—the second and third earls of warwick—viewed the virginia colony primarily as a port of protection for their ships which often raided spanish galleons in the caribbean the sandys faction represented smaller investors who could ill afford high shortterm risks and who therefore were dissatisfied with the smythe regimeby allying himself with the rich family sandys wrested control of the company from smythe but the alliance proved shortlived sandyss opposition to piracy ran him afoul of the third earl of warwick who was offended that governor george yeardley did not properly welcome his ship the treasurer when it arrived in virginia with a stolen cargo of enslaved africans a longtime member of parliament and an outspoken defender of that bodys rights sandys also found an enemy in the king when sandys stood for reelection as company treasurer in  king james intervened choose the devil if you will but not sir edwin sandys he is reputed to have said as a result henry wriothesley third earl of southampton became treasurer on june  tobacco tamperremarkably sandys managed to maintain de facto control of the company he attempted to diversify the virginia economy then overly dependent on tobacco when that effort failed in  sandys negotiated a contract that gave the virginia company a monopoly over tobacco imports to england the details of the contract however showed large salaries being paid to sandys and other officials and questions arose about the finances of a company that was nearly bankruptat about the same time on march   an alliance of virginia indians led by opechancanough launched a series of attacks against english settlements along the james river killing as many as  colonists or about a quarter of virginias colonial population samuel wrote an investor and sandyss enemy called attention to an alarming set of figures he estimated that virginias population in  when sandys took over the company was  another  men women and children had entered the colony in the subsequent three years adding up to a population of  but after opechancanoughs attacks which resulted in the deaths of  colonists only  settlers remained what wrote demanded had happened to the other  most of them it turns out had died of diseasein may  the privy council—responding in part to a petition sent to the king by a faction of councilors allied against sandys—created a royal commission to investigate the virginia company of london that same year nathaniel butler a former governor of the somers islands published the unmasked face of our colony in virginia as it was in the winter of the year  criticizing virginias governance royal commissioners arrived in virginia in march  to see for themselves and on may  of that year the crown formally revoked the companys charter and assumed direct control of the virginia colonyas a financial venture the virginia company of london had failed yet despite so many lost investments and lost lives the english settlement begun at jamestown survived historians looking to connect the early history of the colony with the ideals of the revolutionary war – long suggested that the kings revocation of the companys charter was an act of tyranny edmund s

virginia in  the virginia company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves the famine during the harsh winter of  forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism the colony nearly failed until tobacco emerged as a profitable export it was grown on plantations using primarily indentured servants for the intensive hand labor involved after  the colony turned black slavery into a hereditary racial caste by  the primary cultivators of the cash crop were west african slaves while the plantations thrived because of the high demand for tobacco most white settlers raised their families on subsistence farms warfare with the virginia indian nations had been a factor in the th century after  there was

virginia on april   at the entrance to the chesapeake bay at cape henry they went ashore erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of the sea venture that resulted in bermuda being added to the territory of virginia he discovered over  of the  colonists had died many of the survivors were sick back in

powhatan chief and held her at henricus the economy of the colony was another problem gold had never been found and efforts to introduce profitable industries in the colony had all failed until john rolfe introduced his two foreign types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented these produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to england in  the customers enjoyed the flavor thus making tobacco a cash crop that established virginias economic viability the first anglopowhatan war ended when rolfe married pocahontas in  plantation beginningsedit map depicting the

year the colony acquired a group of twenty and odd angolans brought by two english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing families with motivation to increase production improve standards of living and gain wealth perhaps nowhere was this more progressive than at sir thomas dales

america virginians were intensely individualistic at this point weakening the small new communities according to breen  their horizon was limited by the present or near future they believed that the environment could and should be forced to yield quick financial returns thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed this extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the indians resulting in two massacres conflict with nativesedit a european artists depiction of the indian massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough chief of the pamunkey and brother of chief powhatan he had earned a reputation as a fierce warrior under his brothers chiefdom soon he gave up on hopes of diplomacy and resolved to eradicate the english colonists on march   the powhatan killed about  colonists in the indian massacre of  with coordinated attacks they struck almost all the english

essentially wiped out including henricus and wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another  indians by hand the period between the coup of  and another powhatan attack on english colonists along the james river see jamestown in  marked a turning

berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however most thcentury immigrants were indentured servants merchants or artisans after the restoration in recognition of virginias loyalty to the crown king

and economic difficulties all plagued virginia at this time berkeley established autocratic authority over the colony to protect this power he refused to have new legislative elections for  years in order to protect a house of burgesses that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining

bland tobacco plantationsedit byrd plantation showing how imports and exports came by ship to the front door as the english increasingly used tobacco products tobacco in the american colonies became a significant economic force especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the virginia house of burgesses standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the tobacco inspection act of  which required inspectors to grade tobacco at  specified locations social structureedit in terms of the white population the top five percent or so were planters who possessed growing wealth and increasing political power and social prestige they controlled the local anglican church choosing ministers and handling church property and disbursing local charity they sought elected and appointed offices about  percent of white

farmers were spectators and gamblers selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together the race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding training boasting and gambling and especially winning the races themselves historian timothy breen explains that horse racing and highstakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was possible without a population of lowstatus slaves by  the population reached  and continued to grow rapidly from a high birth rate low

in october  dinwiddie ordered the yearold major george washington whose brother was another ohio company investor of the virginia regiment to warn the french to leave virginia territory ultimately many virginians were caught up in the resulting french and indian war that occurred – at the completion of the war the royal proclamation of  forbade all british settlement past a line drawn along the appalachian mountains with the land west of the proclamation line known as the indian reserve british colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the british government had already assigned land grants to them many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in  by the treaty of lochaber opened much of what is now kentucky and west virginia to british settlement within the virginia colony however the

presbyterians and converted hundreds of slaves by the s baptists were drawing virginians especially poor white farmers into a new much more democratic religion slaves were welcome at the services and many became baptists at this time methodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period methodists encouraged an end to slavery and welcomed free blacks and slaves into active roles in the congregations the baptists and presbyterians were subject to many legal constraints and faced growing persecution between  and  about half of the baptists ministers in virginia were jailed for

support for effective wartime mobilization so they met most of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their

the most populous state and it was allowed to count all of its white residents and  of the enslaved african americans for its congressional representation and its electoral vote only white men who owned a certain amount of property could vote ratification was bitterly contested the proconstitution forces prevailed only after promising to add a bill of rights the virginia ratifying convention approved the constitution by a vote of – on june   making it the tenth state to enter the union madison played a central role in the new congress while washington was the unanimous choice as first

see also history of slavery in virginia the revolution meant change and sometimes political freedom for enslaved african americans too tens of thousands of slaves from southern states particularly in georgia and south carolina escaped to british lines and freedom during the war thousands left with the british for resettlement in their colonies of nova scotia and jamaica others went to england others disappeared into rural and frontier areas or the north inspired by the revolution and evangelical preachers numerous slaveholders in the chesapeake region manumitted some or all of their slaves

comprising less than one percent of the total black population in virginia to  percent by  even as the overall population increased one planter robert carter iii freed more than  slaves in his lifetime more than any other planter george washington freed all of his slaves at his death many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as petersburg richmond and charlottesville for jobs and community others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed among the oldest black baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke out in virginia gabriels rebellion in  and nat turners rebellion in  white reaction was swift and harsh and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves as well as those directly involved in the rebellions after the second rebellion the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color they were excluded from bearing arms serving in the militia gaining education and assembling in groups as bearing arms and serving in the militia were considered obligations of free citizens free blacks came under severe constraints after nat turners rebellion westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders and nonslaveholders as well as former unionists enlisted in great numbers on both sides areas especially in the west and along the border that sent few men to the confederacy were characterized by few slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community the great

erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of the sea venture that resulted in bermuda being added to the territory of virginia he discovered over  of the  colonists had died many of the survivors were sick back in england the virginia company was reorganized under its second charter ratified

first anglopowhatan war against the natives under his leadership samuel argall kidnapped pocahontas daughter of the powhatan chief and held her at henricus the economy of the colony was another problem gold had never been found and efforts to introduce profitable industries in the colony had all failed until john rolfe introduced his two foreign types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented

english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing families with motivation to increase production

communities according to breen  their horizon was limited by the present or near future they believed that the environment could and should be forced to yield quick financial returns thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed this extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the indians resulting in two massacres conflict with nativesedit a european artists depiction of the indian massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough chief of the pamunkey and brother of chief powhatan he had earned a reputation as a fierce warrior under his brothers chiefdom soon he gave up on hopes of diplomacy and resolved to eradicate the english colonists on march   the powhatan killed about

which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location several entire communities were essentially wiped out including henricus and wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another  indians by hand the period between the coup of  and another

about  colonists were killed in another indian massacre led once again by opechancanough berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however most thcentury immigrants were indentured servants merchants or artisans after the restoration in recognition of virginias loyalty to the crown king charles ii of england bestowed virginia with the nickname the old dominion which it still bears today bacons

administration was characterized with many problems disease hurricanes indian hostilities and economic difficulties all plagued virginia at this time berkeley established autocratic authority over the colony to protect this power he refused to have new legislative elections for  years in order to protect a house of burgesses that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels in response to berkeleys harsh repression of the rebels the english government removed him from office after the burning of

increasingly used tobacco products tobacco in the american colonies became a significant economic force especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the virginia house of burgesses standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing

matter for gentlemen only but ordinary farmers were spectators and gamblers selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together the race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding training boasting and gambling and especially winning the races themselves historian timothy breen explains that horse racing and highstakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was possible without a population of lowstatus slaves by  the population reached  and continued to grow

settlement past a line drawn along the appalachian mountains with the land west of the proclamation line known as the indian reserve british colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the british government had already assigned land grants to them many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in  by the treaty of lochaber opened much of what is now kentucky and west virginia to british

around the colony missionaries were sent to the indians but they had little success apart from the nansemond tribe which had converted in  the other powhatan tribes converted to christianity around  the stress on personal piety opened the way for the first great awakening in the mid th century which pulled people away from the formal rituals of the established church especially in the back country most families had no religious affiliation whatsoever and their low moral standards were shocking to proper englishmen the baptists methodists presbyterians and other evangelicals directly challenged these lax moral standards and refused to tolerate them in their ranks baptists german lutherans and presbyterians funded their own ministers and favored disestablishment of the anglican church the spellbinding preacher samuel davies led the presbyterians and converted hundreds of slaves by the s baptists were drawing virginians especially poor white farmers into a new much more democratic religion slaves were welcome at the services and many became baptists at this time methodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period methodists encouraged an end to slavery and welcomed free blacks and slaves into active roles in the congregations the baptists and presbyterians were subject to many legal constraints and faced growing persecution between  and  about half of the baptists ministers in virginia were jailed for preaching in defiance of englands act of toleration of  that guaranteed freedom of worship for protestants at the start of the revolution the anglican patriots realized that they needed dissenter support for effective wartime mobilization so they met most of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their support to jeffersons bill for establishing religious freedom which eventually became law in  as the virginia statute for religious

baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke

westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders and nonslaveholders as well as former unionists enlisted in great numbers on both sides areas especially in the west and along the border that sent few men to the confederacy were characterized by few slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism

for governor in  former confederate general and railroad executive william mahone became the leader of the readjusters forming a coalition of conservative democrats and white and black republicans the

the first landing captain smith foreground main article history of the jamestown settlement – first landingedit in december  the london company dispatched a group of  colonists in three ships the susan constant godspeed and discovery under the command of captain christopher newport after a long rough voyage of  days the colonists finally arrived in virginia on april   at the entrance to the chesapeake bay at cape henry they went ashore erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of the sea venture that resulted in bermuda being added to the territory of virginia he discovered over  of the  colonists had died many of the survivors were sick back in england the virginia company was reorganized under its second charter ratified on may   which gave most leadership authority of the colony to the governor the newly appointed thomas west rd baron de la warr in june  he arrived with  men and ample supplies de la warr began the first anglopowhatan war against the natives under his leadership samuel argall kidnapped pocahontas daughter of the powhatan chief and held her at henricus the economy of the colony was another problem gold had never been found and efforts to introduce profitable industries in the colony had all failed until john rolfe introduced his two foreign types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented these produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to england in  the customers enjoyed the flavor thus making tobacco a cash

assembly in the new world also in  the virginia company sent  single women as potential wives for the male colonists to help populate the settlement that same year the colony acquired a group of twenty and odd angolans brought by two english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing families with motivation to increase production improve standards of living and gain wealth perhaps nowhere was this more progressive than at sir thomas dales illfated henricus a westerlylying

in henrico cittie the falling creek ironworks was established near the confluence of falling creek using local ore deposits to make iron it was the first in north america virginians were intensely individualistic at this point weakening the small new communities according to breen  their horizon was limited by the present or near future they believed that the environment could and should be forced to yield quick financial returns thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed this extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the indians resulting in two massacres conflict with nativesedit a european artists depiction of the indian massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough chief of the pamunkey and brother of chief powhatan he had earned a reputation as a fierce warrior under his brothers chiefdom soon he gave up on hopes of diplomacy and resolved to eradicate the english colonists on march   the powhatan killed about  colonists in the indian massacre of  with coordinated attacks they struck almost all the english settlements along the james river on both shores from newport news point on the east at hampton roads all the way west upriver to falling creek a few miles above henricus and john rolfes plantation varina farms at jamestown a warning by an indian boy named chanco to his employer richard pace helped reduce total deaths pace secured his plantation and rowed across the river during the night to alert jamestown which allowed colonists some defensive preparation they had no time to warn outposts which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location several entire communities were essentially wiped out including henricus and wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another  indians by hand the period between the coup of  and another powhatan attack on english colonists along the james river see jamestown in  marked a turning point in the relations between the powhatan and the english in the early period each side believed it was operating from a position of power by the treaty of  the colonists had taken the balance of power and had established control between the york and blackwater rivers royal colonyedit in  the virginia companys charter was revoked and the colony transferred to royal authority as a crown colony but the elected representatives in jamestown continued to exercise a fair amount of power under royal authority the colony began to expand to the north and west with additional settlements in  a new system of local government was created in the virginia colony by order of the king of england eight shires were designated each with its own local officers these shires were renamed as counties only a few years later governor berkeley and english

explore farther into virginia were hampered in  when about  colonists were killed in another indian massacre led once again by opechancanough berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however most thcentury immigrants were indentured servants merchants or artisans after the restoration in recognition of virginias loyalty to the crown king charles ii of england bestowed virginia with the nickname the old dominion which it still bears today bacons rebellionedit main article bacons rebellion governor berkeley who remained popular after his first administration returned to the governorship at the end of commonwealth rule however berkeleys second administration was characterized with many problems disease hurricanes indian hostilities and economic difficulties all plagued virginia at this time berkeley established autocratic authority over the colony to protect this power he refused to have new legislative elections for  years in order to protect a house of burgesses that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels in response to berkeleys harsh repression of the rebels the english government removed him from office after the burning of jamestown the capital was temporarily moved to middle plantation located on the high ground of the virginia peninsula

plantation showing how imports and exports came by ship to the front door as the english increasingly used tobacco products tobacco in the american colonies became a significant economic force especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the virginia house of burgesses standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the tobacco inspection act of  which required inspectors to grade tobacco at  specified locations social structureedit in terms of the white population the top five percent or so were planters who possessed growing wealth and increasing political power and social prestige they controlled the local anglican church choosing ministers and handling church property and disbursing local charity they sought elected and appointed offices about  percent of white virginians were part of a broad middle class that owned substantial farms by the second generation death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible the bottom third owned no land and verged on poverty many were recent arrivals or recently released from indentured servitude social stratification was most severe in the northern neck where the fairfax family had been given a proprietorship in some districts there  percent of the land was owned by a handful of families and three fourths of the whites had no land at all in the frontier districts large numbers of irish and german protestants had settled often moving down from pennsylvania tobacco was not important there farmers focused on hemp grain cattle and horses entrepreneurs had begun to mine and smelt the local

racing was the main event the typical farmer did not own a horse in the first place and racing was a matter for gentlemen only but ordinary farmers were spectators and gamblers selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together the race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding training boasting and gambling and especially winning the races themselves historian timothy breen explains that horse racing and highstakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was possible without a population of lowstatus slaves by  the population reached  and continued to grow rapidly from a high birth rate low death rate importation of slaves from the caribbean and

 the british crown via the colonial government of virginia granted the ohio company a great deal of this territory on the condition that it be settled by british colonists governor robert dinwiddie of virginia was an investor in the ohio company which stood to lose money if the french held their claim to counter the french military presence in ohio in october  dinwiddie ordered the yearold major george washington whose brother was another ohio company investor of the virginia regiment to warn the french to leave virginia territory ultimately many virginians were caught up in the resulting french and indian war that occurred – at the completion of the war the royal proclamation of  forbade all british settlement past a line drawn along the appalachian mountains with the land west of the proclamation line known as the indian reserve british colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the british government had already assigned land grants to them many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in  by the treaty of lochaber opened much of what is now kentucky and west virginia to british settlement within the virginia colony however the northwest territories north of the ohio continued to be

people away from the formal rituals of the established church especially in the back country most families had no religious affiliation whatsoever and their low moral standards were shocking to proper englishmen the baptists methodists presbyterians and other evangelicals directly challenged these lax moral standards and refused to tolerate them in their ranks baptists german lutherans and presbyterians funded their own ministers and favored disestablishment of the anglican church the spellbinding preacher samuel davies led the presbyterians and converted hundreds of slaves by the s baptists were drawing virginians especially poor white farmers into a new much more democratic religion slaves were welcome at the services and many became baptists at this time methodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period methodists encouraged an end to slavery and welcomed free blacks and slaves into active roles in the congregations the baptists and presbyterians were subject to many legal constraints and faced growing persecution between  and  about half of the baptists ministers in virginia were jailed for preaching in defiance of englands act of toleration of  that guaranteed freedom of worship for protestants at the start of the revolution the anglican patriots realized that they needed dissenter support for effective wartime mobilization so they met most of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their support to jeffersons bill for establishing religious

percent by  even as the overall population increased one planter robert carter iii freed more than  slaves in his lifetime more than any other planter george washington freed all of his slaves at his death many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as petersburg richmond and charlottesville for jobs and community others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed among the oldest black baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke out in virginia gabriels rebellion in  and nat turners rebellion in  white reaction was swift and harsh and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves as well as those directly involved in the rebellions after the second rebellion the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color they were excluded from bearing arms serving in the militia gaining education and assembling in groups as bearing arms and serving in the militia were considered obligations of free citizens free blacks came under severe constraints after nat turners rebellion westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders and nonslaveholders as well as former unionists enlisted in great numbers on both sides areas especially in the west and along the border that sent few men to the confederacy were characterized by few slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community the great majority of the old dominions white citizens could not take

west virginia after his unsuccessful bid for the democratic nomination for governor in  former confederate general and railroad executive william mahone became the leader of the readjusters forming a coalition of conservative democrats and white and black republicans the socalled readjusters aspired to break the power of wealth and established privilege and to promote public education the party promised to readjust the state debt in order to protect funding for newly established public education and allocate a fair share to the new state of west virginia its proposal to repeal the poll tax

for additional teachers in  two additional normal schools were established one at fredericksburg and one at harrisonburg and in  one at radford after the readjuster party disappeared virginia

chesapeake bay at cape henry they went ashore erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of the sea venture that resulted in bermuda being added to the territory of virginia he discovered over  of the  colonists had died many of the survivors were sick back in england the virginia company

types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented these produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to england in  the customers enjoyed the flavor thus making tobacco a cash

twenty and odd angolans brought by two english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing

individualistic at this point weakening the small new communities according to breen  their horizon was limited by the present or near future they believed that the environment could and should be forced to yield quick financial returns thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed this extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the indians resulting in two massacres conflict with nativesedit a european artists depiction of the indian massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough

indian boy named chanco to his employer richard pace helped reduce total deaths pace secured his plantation and rowed across the river during the night to alert jamestown which allowed colonists some defensive preparation they had no time to warn outposts which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location several entire communities were essentially wiped out including henricus and wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another

sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however

that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels in response to berkeleys harsh repression of

especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the virginia house of burgesses standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the tobacco inspection act of  which required inspectors to grade tobacco at  specified locations

class that owned substantial farms by the second generation death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible the bottom third owned no

became skilled horse trainers horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together the race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding training boasting and gambling and especially winning the races themselves historian timothy breen explains that horse racing and highstakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was

settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in

baptists were drawing virginians especially poor white farmers into a new much more democratic religion slaves were welcome at the services and many became baptists at this time methodist missionaries

of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their support to jeffersons bill for establishing religious

percent by  even as the overall population increased one planter robert carter iii freed more than  slaves in his lifetime more than any other planter george washington freed all of his slaves at his death many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as petersburg richmond and charlottesville for jobs and community others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed among the oldest black baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke out in virginia gabriels rebellion in  and nat turners rebellion in  white reaction was swift and harsh and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves as well as those directly involved in the rebellions after the second rebellion the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color they were excluded

severe constraints after nat turners rebellion westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders and nonslaveholders as well as former unionists enlisted in great numbers on both sides areas especially in the west and along the border that sent few men to the confederacy were characterized by few slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community the great majority of the old dominions white citizens could not take

promised to readjust the state debt in order to protect funding for newly established public education and allocate a fair share to the new state of west virginia its proposal to repeal the poll tax

chesapeake bay at cape henry they went ashore erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of

types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented these produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to england in  the customers enjoyed the flavor thus making tobacco a cash

twenty and odd angolans brought by two english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing

forced to yield quick financial returns thus everyone was looking out for number one at the expense of the cooperative ventures farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed this extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the indians resulting in two massacres conflict with nativesedit a european artists depiction of the indian massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough

wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another

sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however

that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels in response to berkeleys harsh repression of

especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the

class that owned substantial farms by the second generation death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible the bottom third owned no

essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was

settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in

of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their support to jeffersons bill for establishing religious

percent by  even as the overall population increased one planter robert carter iii freed more than  slaves in his lifetime more than any other planter george washington freed all of his slaves at his death many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as petersburg richmond and charlottesville for jobs and community others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed among the oldest black baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke out in virginia gabriels rebellion in  and nat turners rebellion in  white reaction was swift and harsh and militias killed many innocent free

severe constraints after nat turners rebellion westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders

slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community the great majority of the old dominions white citizens could not take

promised to readjust the state debt in order to protect funding for newly established public education and allocate a fair share to the new state of west virginia its proposal to repeal the poll tax

chesapeake bay at cape henry they went ashore erected a cross and did a small amount of exploring an event which came to be called the first landing under orders from london to seek a more inland location safe from spanish raids they explored the hampton roads area and sailed up the newly christened james river to the fall line at what would later become the cities of richmond and manchester settlementedit after weeks of exploration the colonists selected a location and founded jamestown on may   it was named in honor of king james i as was the river however while the location at jamestown island was favorable for defense against foreign ships the low and marshy terrain was harsh and inhospitable for a settlement it lacked drinking water access to game for hunting or much space for farming while it seemed favorable that it was not inhabited by the native americans within a short time the colonists were attacked by members of the local paspahegh tribe sketch of jamestown c the colonists arrived illprepared to become selfsufficient they had planned on trading with the native americans for food were dependent upon periodic supplies from england and had planned to spend some of their time seeking gold leaving the discovery behind for their use captain newport returned to england with the susan constant and the godspeed and came back twice during  with the first supply and second supply missions trading and relations with the native americans was tenuous at best and many of the colonists died from disease starvation and conflicts with the natives after several failed leaders captain john smith took charge of the settlement and many credit him with sustaining the colony during its first years as he had some success in trading for food and leading the discouraged colonists after smiths return to england in august  there was a long delay in the scheduled arrival of supplies during the winter of  and continuing into the spring and early summer no more ships arrived the colonists faced what became known as the starving time when the new governor sir thomas gates finally arrived at jamestown on may   along with other survivors of the wreck of

types of tobacco orinoco and sweet scented these produced a better crop than the local variety and with the first shipment to england in  the customers enjoyed the flavor thus making tobacco a cash

twenty and odd angolans brought by two english privateers they were probably the first africans in the colony they along with many european indentured servants helped to expand the growing tobacco industry which was already the colonys primary product although these black men were treated as indentured servants this marked the beginning of americas history of slavery major importation of enslaved africans by european slave traders did not take place until much later in the century in some areas individual rather than communal land ownership or leaseholds were established providing

massacre of  english settlers soon came into conflict with the natives despite some successful interaction issues of ownership and control of land and other resources and trust between the peoples became areas of conflict virginia has drought conditions an average of every three years the colonists did not understand that the natives were illprepared to feed them during hard times in the years after  the colonists cleared land to farm export tobacco their crucial cash crop as tobacco exhausted the soil the settlers continually needed to clear more land for replacement this reduced the wooded land which native americans depended on for hunting to supplement their food crops as more colonists arrived they wanted more land the tribes tried to fight the encroachment by the colonists major conflicts took place in the indian massacre of  and the second anglopowhatan war both under the leadership of the late chief powhatans younger brother chief opechancanough by the midth century the powhatan and allied tribes were in serious decline in population due in large part to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles to which they had no natural immunity the european colonists had expanded territory so that they controlled virtually all the land east of the fall line on the james river fifty years earlier this territory had been the empire of the mighty powhatan confederacy surviving members of many tribes assimilated into the general population of the colony some retained small communities with more traditional identity and heritage in the st century the pamunkey and mattaponi are the only two tribes to maintain reservations originally assigned under the english as of update the state has recognized eleven virginia indian tribes others have renewed interest in seeking state and federal recognition since the celebration of the th anniversary of jamestown in  state celebrations gave native american tribes prominent formal roles to showcase their contributions to the state while the developments of  and continued growth in the several following years were seen as favorable by the english many aspects especially the continued need for more land to grow tobacco were the source of increasing concern to the native americans most affected the powhatan by this time the remaining powhatan empire was led by chief opechancanough

wolstenholme towne at martins hundred at the falling creek ironworks which had been seen as promising for the colony two women and three children were among the  killed leaving only two colonists alive the facilities were destroyed despite the losses two thirds of the colonists survived after withdrawing to jamestown many returned to the outlying plantations although some were abandoned the english carried out reprisals against the powhatan and there were skirmishes and attacks for about a year before the colonists and powhatan struck a truce the colonists invited the chiefs and warriors to jamestown where they proposed a toast of liquor dr john potts and some of the jamestown leadership had poisoned the natives share of the liquor which killed about  men colonists killed another

sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large green spring plantation the colonists defined the  coup as an uprising chief opechancanough expected the outcome would reflect what he considered the morally correct position that the colonists were violating their pledges to the powhatan during the  event chief opechancanough was captured while imprisoned he was murdered by one of his guards after the death of opechancanough and following the repeated colonial attacks in  and  the remaining powhatan tribes had little alternative but to accede to the demands of the settlers most virginia colonists were loyal to the crown charles i during the english civil war but in  oliver cromwell sent a force to remove and replace gov berkeley with governor richard bennett who was loyal to the commonwealth of england this governor was a moderate puritan who allowed the local legislature to exercise most controlling authority and spent much of his time directing affairs in neighboring maryland colony bennett was followed by two more cromwellian governors edward digges and samuel matthews although in fact all three of these men were not technically appointees but were selected by the house of burgesses which was really in control of the colony during these years many royalists fled to virginia after their defeat in the english civil war some intermarried with existing plantation families to establish influential families in virginia such as the washingtons randolphs carters and lees however

that supported him he only agreed to new elections when rebellion became a serious threat berkeley finally did face a rebellion in  indians had begun attacking encroaching settlers as they expanded to the north and west serious fighting broke out when settlers responded to violence with a counterattack against the wrong tribe which further extended the violence berkeley did not assist the settlers in their fight many settlers and historians believe berkeleys refusal to fight the indians stemmed from his investments in the fur trade large scale fighting would have cut off the indian suppliers berkeleys investment relied on nathaniel bacon organized his own militia of settlers who retaliated against the indians bacon became very popular as the primary opponent of berkeley not only on the issue of indians but on other issues as well berkeley condemned bacon as a rebel but pardoned him after bacon won a seat in the house of burgesses and accepted it peacefully after a lack of reform bacon rebelled outright captured jamestown and took control of the colony for several months the incident became known as bacons rebellion berkeley returned himself to power with the help of the english militia bacon burned jamestown before abandoning it and continued his rebellion but died of disease berkeley severely crushed the remaining rebels in response to berkeleys harsh repression of

especially in the tidewater region surrounding the chesapeake bay vast plantations were built along the rivers of virginia and socialeconomic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops planters would then fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses in  the

class that owned substantial farms by the second generation death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible the bottom third owned no

essential to maintaining the status of the gentry when they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse it told the world that competitiveness individualism and materialism where the core elements of gentry values historian edmund morgan  argues that virginians in the s—and for the next two centuries—turned to slavery and a racial divide as an alternative to class conflict racism made it possible for white virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that english republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty that is white men became politically much more equal than was

settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line some of which had been temporarily evacuated during pontiacs war and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled for example george washington and his virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary prominent american colonials joined with the land speculators in britain to lobby the government to move the line further west their efforts were successful and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the native americans in  the treaty of fort stanwix and the treaty of hard labour followed in

baptists were drawing virginians especially poor white farmers into a new much more democratic religion slaves were welcome at the services and many became baptists at this time methodist missionaries

of the dissenters demands in return for their support of the war effort historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the american revolution the struggle for religious toleration was played out during the american revolution as the baptists in alliance with thomas jefferson and james madison worked successfully to disestablish the anglican church after the american victory in the war the anglican establishment sought to reintroduce state support for religion this effort failed when nonanglicans gave their support to jeffersons bill for establishing religious

percent by  even as the overall population increased one planter robert carter iii freed more than  slaves in his lifetime more than any other planter george washington freed all of his slaves at his death many free blacks migrated from rural areas to towns such as petersburg richmond and charlottesville for jobs and community others migrated with their families to the frontier where social strictures were more relaxed among the oldest black baptist congregations in the nation were two founded near petersburg before the revolution each congregation moved into the city and built churches by the early th century twice slave rebellions broke out in virginia gabriels rebellion in  and nat turners rebellion in  white reaction was swift and harsh and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves as well as those directly involved in the rebellions after the second rebellion the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color they were excluded

severe constraints after nat turners rebellion westward emigrationedit in the late th century the wilderness road through the cumberland gap in far southwestern virginia served as a key route across the appalachians to kentucky and for points west until the national road opened in the early th century as the new nation of the united states of america experienced growing pains and began to speak of manifest destiny virginia too found its role in the young republic to be changing and challenging for one the vast lands of the virginia colony were subdivided into other us states and territories in  virginia relinquished its claims to the illinois county virginia except for the virginia military district southern indiana in  daniel boone blazed a trail for the transylvania company from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap into central kentucky this wilderness road became the principal route used by settlers for more than fifty years to reach kentucky from the east the fledgling us government rewarded veterans of the revolutionary war with plots of land along the ohio river in the northwest territory in  three western counties split off to form kentucky a second influence the lands seemed to be more fertile in the west virginias heavy farming of tobacco for  years had depleted its soils the  louisiana purchase only accelerated the westward movement of virginians out of their native state many of the virginians whose grandparents had created the virginia establishment began to emigrate and settle westward famous virginianborn americans affected not only the destiny of the state of virginia but the rapidly developing american old west virginians meriwether lewis and william clark were influential in their famous  expedition to explore the missouri river and possible connections to the pacific ocean notable names such as stephen f austin edwin waller haden harrison edwards and dr john shackelford were famous texan pioneers from virginia even eventual civil war general robert e lee distinguished himself as a military leader in texas during the – mexican–american war cultural preservationedit historians estimate that one million virginians left the commonwealth between the revolution and the civil war with this exodus virginia experienced a decline in both population and political influence  prominent virginians formed the virginia historical and philosophical society to preserve the legacy and memory of its past at the same time with virginians settling so much of the west they brought their cultural habits with them today many cultural features of the american south can be attributed to virginians who migrated west cultural divide between tidewater planters and western virginia farmersedit as the western reaches of virginia were developed in the first half of the th century the vast differences in the agricultural basis cultural and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the virginia general assembly in the older eastern portion slavery contributed to the economy while planters were moving away from laborintensive tobacco to mixed crops they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the atlantic ocean in the western reaches families farmed smaller homesteads mostly without enslaved or hired labor settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources mining of minerals and harvesting of timber the land drained into the ohio river valley and trade followed the rivers representation in the state legislature was heavily skewed in favor of the more populous eastern areas and the historic planter elite this was compounded by the partial allowance for slaves when counting population as neither the slaves nor women had the vote this gave more power to white men the legislatures efforts to mediate the disparities ended without meaningful resolution although the state held a constitutional convention on representation issues thus at the outset of the american civil war virginia was caught not only in national crisis but in a longstanding controversy within its own boundaries while other border states had similar regional differences virginia had a long history of eastwest tensions which finally came to a head it was the only state to divide into two separate states during the war begun in the late th century the james river and kanawha canal was intended to form a transportation link between the james river in the east and the kanawha river flowing into the ohio river across the appalachians infrastructure and industrial revolutionedit after the revolution various infrastructure projects began to be developed including the dismal swamp canal the james river and kanawha canal and various turnpikes virginia was home to the first of all federal infrastructure projects under the new constitution the cape henry light of  located at the mouth of the chesapeake bay following the war of  several federal national defense projects were undertaken in virginia drydock number one was constructed in portsmouth in the  across the james river fort monroe was built to defend hampton roads completed in  in the s railroads began to be built in virginia in  the chesterfield railroad began hauling coal from the mines in midlothian to docks at manchester near richmond powered by gravity and draft animals the first railroad in virginia to be powered by locomotives was the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad chartered in  with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at aquia landing running to washington dc soon after others with equally descriptive names followed the richmond and petersburg railroad and louisa railroad in  the richmond and danville railroad in  the orange and alexandria railroad in  and the richmond and york river railroad in  the virginia board of public works established the blue ridge railroad under engineer claudius crozet the railroad successfully crossed the blue ridge mountains via the blue ridge tunnel at afton mountain petersburg became a manufacturing center as well as a city where free black artisans and craftsmen could make a living in  half its population was black and of that onethird were free blacks the largest such population in the state remains of the washington iron furnace in franklin county which operated from about  to  iron industryedit with extensive iron deposits especially in the western counties virginia was a pioneer in the iron industry the first ironworks in the new world was established at falling creek in  though it was destroyed in  there would eventually grow to be  ironworks charcoal furnaces and forges with  hands at any one time about  percent of them slaves ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers easier to control and could not switch to a better employer but the work ethic was weak because the wages went to the owner not to the workers who were forced to work hard were poorly fed and clothed and were separated from their families virginias industry increasingly fell behind pennsylvania new jersey and ohio which relied on free labor bradford  recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the overreliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers although lewis  reports that some were in skilled positions civil waredit main article virginia in the american civil war the battle of hampton roads was fought in the james river near hampton in  virginia at first refused to join the confederacy but did so after president lincoln on april  called for troops from all states that meant federal troops crossing virginia on the way south to subdue south carolina on april   the convention voted to secede and voters ratified the decision on may  immediately the union army moved into northern virginia and captured alexandria without a fight and controlled it for the remainder of the war the wheeling area had opposed secession and remained strong for the union because of its strategic significance the confederacy relocated its capital to richmond richmond was at the end of a long supply line and as the highly symbolic capital of the confederacy became the main target of round after round of invasion attempts a major center of iron production during the civil war was located in richmond at tredegar iron works which produced most of the artillery for the war the city was the site of numerous army hospitals libby prison for captured union officers gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions with a high death rate richmonds main defenses were trenches built surrounding it down towards the nearby city of petersburg saltville was a primary source of confederate salt critical for food preservation during the war leading to the two battles of saltville the first major battle of the civil war occurred on july   union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at manassas but the confederate army reached it first and won the first battle of manassas known as bull run in northern naming convention both sides mobilized for war the year  went on without another major fight men from all economic and social levels both slaveholders

slaves poor economies and a history of reinal antagonism to the tidewater west virginia breaks awayedit see also restored government of virginia the western counties could not tolerate the confederacy breaking away they first formed the union state of virginia recognized by washington it is called the restored government of virginia and was based in alexandria across the river from washington the restored government did little except give its permission for congress to form the new state of west virginia in  from may to august  a series of unionist conventions met in wheeling the second wheeling convention constituted itself as a legislative body called the restored government of virginia it declared virginia was still in the union but that the state offices were vacant and elected a new governor francis h pierpont this body gained formal recognition by the lincoln administration on july  on august  the wheeling body passed an ordinance for the creation it was put to public vote on oct  the vote was in favor of a new state—west virginia—which was distinct from the pierpont government which persisted until the end of the war congress and lincoln approved and after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution west virginia became the th state on june   in effect there were now three states the confederate virginia the union restored virginia and west virginia the state and national governments in richmond did not recognize the new state and confederates did not vote there the confederate government in richmond sent in robert e lee but lee found little local support and was defeated by union forces from ohio union victories in  drove the confederate forces out of the monongahela and kanawha valleys and throughout the remainder of the war the union held the region west of the alleghenies and controlled the baltimore and ohio railroad in the north the new state was not subject to reconstruction later war yearsedit for the remainder of the war many major battles were fought across virginia including the seven days battles the battle of fredericksburg the battle of chancellorsville the battle of brandy station over the course of the war despite occasional tactical victories and spectacular counterstroke raids confederate control of many regions of virginia was gradually lost to federal advance by october  the northern th and th congressional districts along the potomac were under union control eastern shore northern middle and lower peninsula and the nd congressional district surrounding norfolk west to suffolk were permanently unionoccupied by may other regions such as the piedmont and shenandoah valley regularly changed hands through numerous campaigns in  the union army planned to attack richmond by a direct overland approach through overland campaign and the battle of the wilderness culminating in the siege of petersburg which lasted from the summer of  to april  by november   confederate forces controlled only four of virginias  congressional districts in the region of richmondpetersburg and their southside counties in april  richmond was burned by a retreating confederate army  lincoln walked the city streets to cheering crowds of newly freed blacks the confederate government fled south pausing in danville for a few days the end came when lee surrendered to ulysses grant at appomattox on april   reconstructionedit further information reconstruction era remains of a locomotive of the richmond and petersburg railroad at the destroyed depot in richmond virginia had been devastated by the war with the infrastructure such as railroads in ruins many plantations burned out and large numbers of refugees without jobs food or supplies beyond rations provided by the union army especially its freedmens bureau historian mary farmerkaiser reports that white landowners complained to the bureau about unwillingness of freedwomen to work in the fields as evidence of their laziness and asked the bureau to force them to sign labor contracts in response many bureau officials readily condemned the withdrawal of freedwomen from the work force as well as the hen pecked husbands who allowed it while the bureau did not force freedwomen to work it did force freedmen to work or be arrested as vagrants furthermore agents urged poor unmarried mothers to give their older children up as apprentices to work for white masters farmerkaiser concludes that freedwomen found both an ally and an enemy in the bureau there were three phases in virginias reconstruction era wartime presidential and congressional immediately after the war president andrew johnson recognized the francis harrison pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government the virginia legislature passed black codes that severely restricted freedmens mobility and rights they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens nor could they vote the state ratified the th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the  ordnance of secession johnson was satisfied that reconstruction was complete other republicans in congress refused to seat the newly elected state delegation the radicals wanted better evidence that slavery and similar methods of serfdom had been abolished and the freedmen given rights of citizens they also were concerned that virginia leaders had not renounced confederate nationalism after winning large majorities in the  national election the radical republicans gained power in congress they put virginia and nine other exconfederate states under military rule virginia was administered as the first military district in – under general john schofield meanwhile the freedmen became politically active by joining the prorepublican union league holding conventions and demanding universal male suffrage and equal treatment under the law as well as demanding disfranchisement of exconfederates and the seizure of their plantations mcdonough finding that schofield was criticized by conservative whites for supporting the radical cause on the one hand and attacked on the other by radicals for thinking black suffrage was premature on the other concludes that he performed admirably by following a middle course between extremes increasingly a deep split opened up in the republican ranks the moderate element had national support and called itself true republicans the more radical element set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office if he was a private in the confederate army or had sold food to the confederate government plus land reform about  former confederates were denied the right to vote in the  election in  radical james hunnicutt – a white preacher editor and scalawag white southerners supporting reconstruction mobilized the black republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to freedmen and poor whites the true republicans the moderates led by former whigs businessmen and planters while supportive of black suffrage drew the line at property confiscation a compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters hunnicutts coalition took control of the republican party and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the confederacy the virginia republican party became permanently split and many moderate republicans switched to the opposition conservatives the radicals won the  election for delegates to a constitutional convention an industrial school set up for exslaves in richmond during reconstruction the  constitutional convention included  white conservatives and  radicals of whom  were blacks  scalawag and  carpetbaggers called the underwood constitution after the presiding officer the main accomplishment was to reform the tax system and create a system of free public schools for the first time in virginia after heated debates over disfranchising confederates the virginia legislature approved a constitution that excluded exconfederates from holding office but allowed them to vote in state and federal elections under pressure from national republicans to be more moderate general schofield continued to administer the state through the army he appointed a personal friend henry h wells as provisional governor wells was a carpetbagger and a former union general schofield and wells fought and defeated hunnicutt and the scalawag republicans they took away contracts for state printing orders from hunnicutts newspaper the national government ordered elections in  that included a vote on the new underwood constitution a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels and a separate vote for state officials the army enrolled the freedmen exslaves as voters but would not allow some  prominent whites to vote or hold office the republicans nominated wells for governor as hunnicutt and most scalawags went over to the opposition the leader of the moderate republicans calling themselves true republicans was william mahone – a railroad president and former confederate general he formed a coalition of white scalawag republicans some blacks and exdemocrats who formed the conservative party mahone recommended that whites had to accept the results of the war including civil rights and the vote for freedmen mahone convinced the conservative party to drop its own candidate and endorse gilbert c walker mahones candidate for governor in return mahones people endorsed conservatives for the legislative races mahones plan worked as the voters in  elected walker and defeated the proposed disfranchisement of exconfederates when the new legislature ratified the th and th amendments to the us constitution congress seated its delegation and virginia reconstruction came to an end in january  the radical republicans had been ousted in a nonviolent election virginia was the only southern state that did not elect a civilian government that represented more radical republican principles suffering from widespread destruction and difficulties in adapting to free labor white virginians generally came to share the postwar bitterness typical of the southern attitudes historian richard lowe argues that the obstacles faced by the radical republican movement made their cause hopeless even more damaging to republicans prospects than their poverty their inexperience in state politics their isolation from potential allies and their identification with the heated north was the perverse and powerful racism that ran so powerfully through the white community the great majority of the old dominions white citizens could not take

promised to readjust the state debt in order to protect funding for newly established public education and allocate a fair share to the new state of west virginia its proposal to repeal the poll tax
