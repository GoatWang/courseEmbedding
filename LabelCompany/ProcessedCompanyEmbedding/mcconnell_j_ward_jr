again j ward mcconnell jr from dealer to manufacturer and back again by lynn marcinkowski woolf posted on april    posted in dealer news the vice chairman of art’s way mfg recently opened a dealership in marietta ohio carrying the branson tractor line and big tex trailers j ward mcconnell jr former chairman of art’s way mfg recently celebrated the opening of his new branson tractor dealership crescentmcconnell tractors  equipment in marietta ohio mcconnell says he’s been a dealer since  he just happened to take a year break to pursue a series of farm equipment manufacturing investments including selling a tractor line to agco in  and another company to art’s way manufacturing in  he assumed the role of chairman of art’s way in  and during his year tenure as chair he quadrupled the size of the company and earned recognition from forbes magazine as being one of the best small companies in america he retired from the chairman position in  and continues to serve as a director on the board and vice chairman his son marc mcconnell now serves as chairman why at  years old is mcconnell starting on a new venture lots of reasons and as mcconnell shared the background regarding his new dealership i was impressed by the life and business lessons he shared first look for opportunities mcconnell says that after so many years in the business he is regularly approached by those with a business to sell and often those businesses are in a distressed state that’s how he came to own a plumbing and electrical supply company in marietta “if there’s a remaining business i can generally turn it around and be profitable” mcconnell says after looking for opportunities look for more opportunities for instance when mcconnell surveyed the site of the plumbing and electrical business he saw a new possibility “there are three buildings on the property and i looked at one of the buildings that sat mostly empty and said ‘that looks pretty good for a tractor dealership’” he says         the building is about  feet by  feet has a large showroom window and faces a busy highway he knew the timing was right to enter the rural equipment market “the rural lifestyle market is very appealing it’s the best market now” he says then turn to people and products you trust that’s how mcconnell chose the branson line he learned about the line a few years ago from ew swede muehlhausen who at the time was assisting branson’s korean management team in north america and who had also served as president of art’s way “i had heard quite a bit about branson and their reputation is outstanding branson requires much less commitment to get started as a dealer than other lines everything seemed to fit together so well” mcconnell says crescentmcconnell is also carrying big tex trailers a line that was recommended by rob graham who handles sales for the dealership graham brings experience from working at a john deere dealership as well as tractor supply co graham runs the daytoday operations as mcconnell is based in north carolina the two talk daily and the administration is handled from the north carolina office dive in but don’t overcommit the initial order was for  tractors and several rotary cutters “it’s going to take a couple of years to get on our feet it’s a new tractor brand a new territory a new everything for us  we’re going to run a low profile for starters and grow from there” mcconnell says they stocked parts based on branson’s recommendations and plan to add a service department be smart mcconnell has seen a lot of dealers come and go throughout his career and he offers this advice “a lot of dealers have gone under because they start handling a lot of money and start spending the money personally more people seem to go broke because of personal spending” he says finally a love of the business doesn’t hurt “i enjoy being in business and i enjoy coming to work every day i’ve been doing it so long now that i don’t know how not to do it” incorporating any one of these lessons could bring about good changes at your dealership     keywords art’s way manufacturing big tex trailers branson tractors j ward mcconnell lynn marcinkowski woolf
