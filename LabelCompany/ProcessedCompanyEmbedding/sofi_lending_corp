the main story photo sofi members mingle at an invitationonly singles cocktail party hosted by the online banking company credit adrienne grunwald for the new york times san francisco — alyson casey recently received an invitation to a singles event in manhattan from a startup but it didn’t come from a dating service it came from the company that had recently refinanced her student loan sofithe idea of a financial firm playing matchmaker initially struck ms casey a yearold software saleswoman as rather unorthodox but the invitation promised an even split of men and women and free drinks at the rooftop bar of the james hotelafter a few glasses of wine — and a few phone numbers collected — the idea of a student lender helping her find a mate made a lot of sense to her“these are people with a similar mindset” said ms casey who used sofi to refinance the student loan that paid for her mba at new york university “people who aren’t riskaverse people who understand a good investment” advertisement continue reading the main story ms casey is not the only one who has been impressed by sofi’s strategy of stretching the definition of what a lender should do in addition to holding singles events sofi — short for social finance inc — provides career counseling wine tastings and homebuying workshops and is starting to provide financial services other than loans continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story this approach is helping elevate sofi with potential customers and investors in a business — online lending — that has had no shortage of trouble over the past yearafter growing swiftly for several years the nascent industry of online lending was severely shaken in may when the largest company in the field lending club dumped its founder and acknowledged financial records were misstatedthe investors who had been buying loans originated by lending club and rivals like prosper ondeck and funding circle fled from nearly everyone in the market including sofi forcing the lenders to curtail their business significantly at a time when they needed to grow to fulfill the expectations of venture capitalists photo credit adrienne grunwald for the new york times sofi courted its own controversy with unapologetically elitist advertisements including one during the super bowl in january the company generally lends money only to young wealthy borrowers — whom it refers to as henrys an acronym for high earners not rich yetbut as the turmoil has calmed down sofi is emerging as the new leader in may a sofi bond backed by the company’s loans was awarded an aaa rating by moody’s investors service a first for sofi the company is now originating more student personal and home loans than it was before the lending club crisis unlike its competitorsso far this year sofi has lent out  billion up from the  billion it originated all of last year and the  billion it did in  the company has now issued loans to  customers“they are the no  player in the space now” said matt burton the cofounder of orchard platform which provides a marketplace for online lenders advertisement continue reading the main story in a recent interview at sofi’s offices in san francisco the chief executive mike cagney said the company was preparing to expand to europe and asia and to introduce products like life insurance in the coming monthsmr cagney has recently been traveling through asia and europe raising around  million in new funding for sofi the new investors will increase sofi’s valuation from its last fundraising round when it was worth  billion mr cagney said though he declined to say what valuation it was targetingthe previous rounds involved daniel s loeb’s hedge fund third point peter thiel and the japanese conglomerate softbankmr cagney declined to answer questions about any plans for an initial public offering — sofi had been working toward one but put it off when it raised money in the new money will help support mr cagney’s ambitions to expand sofi from a specialized student loan provider to one offering wealth management deposit accounts and other products photo in addition to singles events sofi offers career counseling and homebuying workshopsthe firm started by refinancing student loans but is expanding into other product lines credit adrienne grunwald for the new york times matt harris a partner at bain capital ventures said that among the most intractable hurdles facing online lenders were the high cost of acquiring customers and the difficulty of building a relationship that outlasts the first loanhe said that sofi had found a neat solution to these problems by providing additional services like the singles events and career counseling“it is a very different strategy than the more transactional lenders” said mr harris who is not an investor in sofi referring to competitors like lending club “if you are playing a lifetime value game — a relationship game — you have a lot more leeway to subsidize more products and you are less subject to commodification and the vagaries of competition” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a

company with three cofounders in  by refinancing the student loans of fellow stanford business school graduates advertisement continue reading the main story within  months he expects that mortgages which were introduced just this year will be the company’s biggest product line they currently represent about  percent of sofi’s business while student loan refinancing is still roughly  percentmr cagney however is likely to confront plenty of hurdlesbecause sofi and the other online lenders are not banks they do not have a steady base of consumer deposits to fund their loans as a result they must rely on big investors who are often alarmed when there is any sign of trouble — as happened earlier this yearsince the spring mr cagney has frequently been on the road getting bigger credit lines from banks and searching for a broader array of investors to buy the company’s loans he said sofi now had a credit line of  billion from banks that it could use to originate loans even without investors in contrast to the  billion it had when the first signs of trouble struck the online lending industry last wintermr cagney has also been spending time in utah weighing whether to seek a bank charter from the state which would allow sofi to begin collecting deposits sofi is opening a service center in utah and mr cagney said he was looking into what becoming a bank would mean he is still wary because regulations may limit sofi’s ability to do things like hold singles and networking eventsthe federal deposit insurance corporation “is very particular about what banks can and cannot do” he said “there are a lot of things we do that don’t fit into a bank holding company that are critical to our brand and our mission if we can’t do those things we lose a lot of what makes sofi different” photo credit adrienne grunwald for the new york times on the regulatory front some industry experts have said that sofi could face problems because of its elitist approach serving only customers with the most pristine credit in the most recent pool of sofi personal loans the average annual income of the borrowers was  a year and the average credit score was  according to the rating agency krollbanking regulations bar lenders from any practices that have a discriminatory impact on minorities even if the impact is a result of algorithms rather than human decision making while not a bank at the moment sofi is audited by the fdic and regulated by the consumer financial protection bureauthe pursuit of elite customers also leaves some investors concerned that sofi will not have a base of potential consumers large enough to sustain a big business these customers often pay off their loans quickly and are by their very nature relatively few in number advertisement continue reading the main story that is why mr cagney is looking to europe and asia and is building out more products to offer his customersat the singles event in new york the clientele appeared to appreciate sofi’s strategyms casey the software saleswoman said that after refinancing her student loan she had refinanced her credit card debt with sofi when the company began offering that service last yeara few tables over lisa akey said she learned about sofi from a classmate at school who loved it and had since talked up the company to her friends“immediately i felt it was a company i could trust” said ms akey  a brand manager at unilever “i feel like banks are just banks sofi feels like it’s more built around people”kim hutchison a yearold lawyer said she had refinanced her law school debt a month

all that can afford to do so so we’ve kept the minimum low—just  or an automatic periodic transfer of at least  per month there is no minimum holding period and you can withdraw your money at any time of course if you have a retirement account there may be tax consequences for withdrawing your money so be sure to talk to your tax advisorwhat are etfsetfs are exchangetraded funds these are collections of investments that trade as a single security and they commonly offer a simplified lowcost way to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks andor bonds on the one hand they work like mutual funds with tax advantages as well as diversification from investing in a broad range of assets on the other hand you get the flexibility and low costs of individual stocks etfs can invest in most types of securities and be actively managed or not actively managed etfs typically have higher management fees than passively managed ones sofi wealth primarily invests in passively invested etfs through its model portfolios we proactively manage the mix of these funds and will change that mix as world economic conditions or our outlook change this gives you the advantages of active management the broad diversification of index funds and the low fees of index etfs and our ultralow management fee keep in mind that diversification does not eliminate risk and does not assure better performance how often will my portfolio be rebalancedrebalancing is when we sell some the etfs that have gone up in value and buy more of the ones that went down in order to keep your portfolio close to its original mix of investments called the “neutral allocation” it is important to do this periodically we will look at portfolios at least quarterly to see if any one asset is more than  percentage points off its neutral allocation called a “tolerance band” if so we’ll rebalance the account we might do it more often if for example there is a big move in one asset class or if we decide to change the mix of the funds in the portfolioif i sign up for sofi wealth at just  annually will your financial advisors try to upsell meno we believe the best advice is unbiased advice so sofi wealth’s financial advisors aren’t compensated on commission they’re accessible when you have questions or need some help but they won’t cold call you with aggressive upselling like other advisors might do we
