writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could

press release that was issued with the results this morning and also in sts most recent regulatory filings for a full description of these risk factors also to ensure all participants have an opportunity to ask questions during the qa session please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up id now like to turn the call over to carlo bozotti sts president and ceo carlo carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings conference call our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results and our outlook for the second quarter but before starting this detailed review of the quarter you might have seen that this morning we also released the main resolutions proposed to our annual general meeting of shareholders among the resolutions i have accepted to the proposal to extend my role as president and the ceo for one more year and i am fully committed to drive this company forward and of course this is with the support of the newly appointed deputy ceo jeanmarc chery and the strong executive team our objective for  is to achieve a sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion through our strategic focus on internet of things and the smart driving the first quarter represented a very good start towards achieving this objective revenues increased  yearoveryear to  billion we saw healthy growth across all our regions product groups and sales channels on a sequential basis revenues decreased  which was  basis points better than the mean point of our guidance gross margin increased  basis points yearoveryear to  we benefited from a strong improvement in manufacturing efficiencies a better product mix lower unused capacity charges and favorable currency effects partially offset by the normal pricing adjustment at the start of the year on a sequential basis gross margin came in at  basis points better than the midpoint of our range on better than expected product mix operating income before impairment and restructuring grew by  million yearoveryear to  million in the first quarter driven by higher revenues improved product mix manufacturing efficiencies better fab loading and the settop box restructuring program in turn operating margin before impairment and restructuring reached  of net revenues net income also saw a very strong yearoveryear swing of  million to  million free cash flow of  million doubled already year ago quarter even with the higher capital investments we are making this year to support our growth plans we ended the quarter with a net financial position of  million stable compared to the q  and up by  million from the year ago quarter another indicator of our progress now lets move to a detailed review of our product groups beginning with automotive and discrete adg revenues increased yearoveryear by  reflecting growth in automotive and strong growth in power discrete products on a sequential basis adg revenues posted a better than seasonal results with a decrease of  adgs operating margin was  in q substantially stable in comparison to the year ago period moving to customer activity bookings in automotive were robust in the first quarter thanks to our focus on technologies and products enabling greener driving we had important design wins related to car electrification particularly in the area of battery management and onboard charging a number of oems worldwide selected products such as our mosfet both high and low voltage silicon as well as silicon carbide our bit microcontrollers and the lithiumcell balancing device we also captured the body control unit for a module from an american tier and the power control unit for a door zone application at a major european tier we also had a number of important wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience we started production of a bit microcontroller for embedded security in a next generation automotive gateway we won an award for a seat belt pretensioner application with our bit microcontroller for a major tier  european customer and we had multiple wins with a parking brake application specific product in our infotainment portfolio we were awarded new business to our processors amfm tuners and the class ab amplifiers from japanese tier for the asian market in addition we had design wins and multiple global tier for rectifiers protection devices and automotivegrade ipad devices for powertrain onboard charger adas and safety and highspeed data line networks successes in our power discrete business includes a number of wins in asia for both high and low voltage power supply applications and a continued expansion of our business on rf integrated passive devices for the iot market with several large customers moving to our analog and mems group amg revenues increased  yearoveryear driven by strong growth in mems continuing the significant progression begun in the second half of  we also enjoyed solid growth in analog products following second half  rebound on a sequential basis amg revenues increased  better than seasonal with both product areas growing the strong improvement in amg product portfolio and competitive position have translated into a significant turnaround in its operating performance over the last two quarters with operating margins of  in q  and  in q this year compared to substantially breakeven results one year ago our ability to design in multiple products into flagship smartphone and iot devices was evident during the first quarter first we ramped production of several products inside the samsung galaxy s and s smartphones including axis ultralowpower mems inertial measurements unit and opticalimage stabilization gyroscope a barometric sensor a touch controller and the multifunction protection switch and in the new and very popular nintendo gaming system the switch we have motion sensors and the touch controller as well as multiple stm microcontrollers and near field communication controller from our microcontrollers and digital ics group as well we continue to gain share with motion and the environmental sensors in smartphones and wearables worldwide but also in communication systems automotive is an important focus area for our sensor business moving to iot we continued the strong designin momentum in lowpower wireless connectivity with our bluetooth low energy solutions as well as the spirit subghz family for home and building automation during the quarter we also launched a partnership with usound to produce the worlds first piezomems speaker with excellent sound quality targeting iot applications in smart industry we broadened our customer base for our stspin motion control family including multiple designs for our newly introduced intelligent motor control devices we also started production for a axis inertial sensor for highend industrial applications in addition we won multiple designs for a range of analog products for the nextgeneration smart metering solutions our broad analog portfolio strongly complements our other product families allowing us to designin more silicon content across our customer base now let me share some highlights on our microcontrollers and digital ics group mdg saw a strong progression with revenues increasing yearoveryear by  or  if we exclude discontinued businesses key drivers were strong growth in general purpose microcontrollers and growth in digital products mdgs operating income and margin also had very positive swing with its operating income up  million yearoveryear and its operating margin of  in the first quarter with our general purpose microcontrollers we again set a new quarterly revenue record with a goal to continue the momentum going forward we introduced new products for our existing stm families including new stml mcus adding larger memories enhanced graphics support and increased powersaving flexibility we continued to expand the stm ecosystem with tools from stm partners for example we teamed with dsp concepts to offer stm users free access to an advanced audio design tool we also introduced the mcu finder for pc desktops a new stmf nucleo board and discovery kit a new stm board to evaluate lowpower longrange iot connectivity getting our development tools into the hands of embedded developers is a key step in the designin process and with over  million stm development kits now shipped to the market we are on the right track to expand our base of over  customers moving to security we announced the availability of the new advanced near field communication stnfcd sic stnfcd  controller integrating the recently acquired booster technology this product was already awarded a design win with a major oem we also launched a new stsafe solution to secure devices connected to the sigfox lowpower widearea network and we teamed with giesecke and fitpay mobilepayment to offer a solution to integrate tokenized payments from mastercard or visa on wearable devices benefiting from our recent acquisition we captured a key win for our st near field communication reader portfolio at a major car oem we also introduced dynamictag ics that support higher speed and greater distance rfid also in this area we are focused on making our products easier for our customers to evaluate and designin and we introduced a new st discovery kit that accelerates timetomarket for nfc applications to complete the review of our products lets now discuss our imaging product division which we report in others imaging revenues in the first quarter more than doubled to  million compared to the yearago quarter driven by sts innovative timeofflight technology we had multiple new design wins and continued highvolume shipment of timeofflight ranging sensors to leading smartphone manufacturers during q our flightsense technology was integrated in seven new smartphones launched by asian brands we also announced a new generation of timeofflight sensor which brings multiobject detection and multiarray scanning to mobile applications turning now to our second quarter guidance we expect to make further progress in revenue and margins we continue to see strong bookings across all product groups and regions a careful analysis of pointofsales data or sales through distribution continues to indicate a very healthy demand environment therefore based upon our current visibility we expect the sequential revenue growth of about  which translates to yearoveryear growth of  at the midpoint we are targeting a gross margin of about  at the midpoint taking these two data points it is clear that we see the opportunity in q to deliver substantial yearoveryear and sequential growth in operating income and net income looking further ahead we are continuing to prepare for a major program introduction as anticipated there is no revenue contribution from this program in our q guidance and we are on track to ramp substantial revenues in the second half of this year more broadly our investments to scale up production in  inches our inch to inch fab conversions and our technology evolution will help drive wafer cost reductions benefiting all product groups finally today sts supervisory board is proposing to shareholders to declare a cash dividend of  per share payable in four equal quarterly installments starting with the second quarter of  the  annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled for june   and my colleagues and i will now be happy to take your questions and we look forward to meeting with you on may  at our  capital markets day in london thank you questionandanswer session operator the first question is from achal sultania from credit suisse please go ahead achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd hi good morning everyone just a clarification on the mems business i think you talked about the several chips being used in the galaxy s and s devices i think in some of those sockets in the past youve shared that chip with some other supplier because that device has had two variants one with qualcomm chip and one with exynos chip can you give us some color as to whether that is still continuing with s and s or are you becoming more of a sole supplier in some of those sockets in this generation carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well of course its difficult for me to comment on such detailed question but the impression that we have is that certainly our share is lions share achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay but if the share is not changing its lions share but its not changing from last year is that the right way to think about it carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well you can see if the share is  its difficult in general to change achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thank you and one question on the automotive side of things i think youve talked about bookings being strong in q i think were starting to see some data points that china obviously was very very strong last year and the yearonyear comps are a bit difficult as we go into q q of this year are we seeing any signs of that as yet in the bookings number or you think that the content increase is enough or is accelerating which will offset any slowdown in volume growth is that the case or are you not seeing any volume slow down as yet carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv no its the opposite we see an acceleration of our business in the automotive q it is certainly a low point for automotive and we expect to grow significantly overall i also want to make the point that we have on top of adg other products that we sell to automotive customers of course including our sensors and including our digital products  so they are important products that we sell to our automotive customers that we do not report in adg and overall i want to make sure its clear our ambition is to grow significantly this year in the automotive business and certainly we do not see any slowdown and we see an acceleration of our automotive business moving from q to q and the rest of the year achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thanks thanks a lot carlo carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you achal next question operator the next question is from gareth jenkins from ubs please go ahead gareth jenkins  ubs ltd thanks just a couple if i could the capex run rate looks like its tracking slightly below your full year guidance so just wondered whether youre finding more efficiencies in capex than you thought or whether we should expect a pick up through the rest of the year and then i have a follow up thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo will take this carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv thank you carlo good morning everyone now i will not read the first quarter number as a sign on the run rate  for the year we are absolutely on track on the plan of  billion capex spending for the year we are in the process now to look at the volume and the capacity needed for second half of the year entering  so in this respect at this stage i believe you may continue to make reference to the previous guidance we will meet in a few weeks at our capital market day that could be an opportunity eventually to tune the numbers but please do not consider the number of the first quarter as a sign not to be at the high of the range for this year and capacity  is what needed in order to serve business and increase the revenues significant for the second half of the year gareth jenkins  ubs ltd thats great thank you very much and just as a follow up can i just have a follow up take on the under saturation charges presumably zero in the last quarter and zero going forward from here from that statement carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah very minor in both cases we are running with the fab almost all at full loading we are in the process of increasing capacities improving the service to customer and building higher revenues for the next quarters gareth jenkins  ubs ltd thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you gareth next question please operator the next question is from sandeep deshpande from jpmorgan please go ahead sandeep sudhir deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi thank you for letting me on my question is regarding the nextgeneration technologies in d sensing you have some technologies associated with d sensing can you carlo possibly help us understand what technology you have associated with this and is it purely sensing technologies or are you also selling digital chips associated with this secondly my question is regarding the capex you announced earlier this year what percentage of the capex are you spending on frontend versus backend thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv okay our activity in this field is very broad and i think jeanmarc will comment here and then carlo will take the second question jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv so jeanmarc speaking so more basically to make history as simple as possible for d sensing we see really two technologies which are key enablers is what we call structured light and the second one we call timeofflight technology and in timeofflight it was direct or indirect timeofflight what i can say at this stage is that st from silicon point of view we own we develop we control we are able to make the manufacturing of all technologies which are key whatever is the timeofflight or the structured light then in term of module assembly of the key module linked to this technology we completely control the technology in term of module assemblies we have the skill to manage all the critical components which are related to the structured light and we are able to make the manufacturing of the module so st is completely well positioned with his specialty imaging strategy to address this market of d sensing whatever are the technology timeofflight or structured light sandeep sudhir deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc sorry i have one follow up on that jeanmarc which is does your technology require a separate digital chip beyond the sensing module that you will sell jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv of course okay you need to have a digital chip to embed the software because structured light is very complex request in term of software so you have the separate chips digital chips to receive the signal from the various component and create the d image sandeep sudhir deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc and do you supply that digital chip as well jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv no sandeep sudhir deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc okay thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you sandeep next question carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv i guess sandeep has a second question on the capital spend in this year between frontend and backend when taking frontend manufacturing and rd this is about  probing assembling and testing will be about  sandeep sudhir deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc thank you carlo ferro carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you sandeep next question operator the next question is from adithya metuku from merrill lynch please go ahead adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch yes good morning guys so my question is firstly a clarification could you give us some highlight on the growth rates in the automotive microcontroller and analog and mems businesses in the past quarter and then i have a quick follow up on opex carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv so the first question is about the growth rate on automotive adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch automotive microcontroller and analog and mems carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv right so i think we can go through carlo well go through familybyfamily if you – we have all the data of course carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv your question is in reference to which period the first quarter adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch yes first quarter carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay its in the press release right adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch no i dont mean the groups i mean automotive within the division that you disclosed carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay so i believe that the answer the best way for characterizing it is that in the area of adg both automotive and the power and discrete enjoyed better than seasonal trend overall then in the case of amg it has been another strong quarter for mems but also a stronger quarter for analog and certainly in the field of mdg you may have noted there is some further erosion in the area of the digital business and the legacy business there while general purpose microcontrollers remain particularly solid adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch okay my quick follow up is on opex carlo ferro could you give us a bit of color taking into the current spot rates what you expect in terms of growth in net opex in the next quarter and then the second half of the year thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah we remain on our target to maintain in average the net opex in the range of  million we have anticipated that there is some unbalance quarterly due to seasonality particularly third quarter is cheaper in seasonality if i can use the word second quarter and fourth quarter a bit higher so i would basically  between  million to  million net operating expenses in the second quarter adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv next question please operator next question is from jerome ramel from exane bnp paribas please go ahead jerome ramel  exane inc yeah good morning a question on automotive in q i mean automotive and discrete you were up  yearonyear and you mentioned that discrete grew faster so my question is why the automotive growing not in line with peer because peer is quite distant to peer in q  yearonyear much more than  so do you think youre losing market share or do you see youre going to have an acceleration in as you mentioned before in the second half of this year thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think first of all we need to look at the perimeter as i said i mean there will be a strong acceleration of the growth and this will be across the board for all automotive products it will be on what we traditionally called apg which is smart power and microcontrollers and digital automotive it will be on power mos it will be on sic and it will be also on our mems for instance for automotive applications and the visibility that we have today for the automotive growth yearoveryear is far above the  that you mentioned jerome ramel  exane inc okay and maybe a follow up i had in mind that your mems business for automotive was about   million per quarter is that the right number carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well this is a very detailed question we are growing significantly i think it still is below  million jerome ramel  exane inc okay thank you very much carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you jerome next question operator the next question is from janardan menon from liberum capital please go ahead janardan menon  liberum capital ltd hi good morning thanks for taking the question just going back to a comment that you made that your capex in the second half will also depend on what the volume expectations are et cetera and you talked about the significant ramp in the second half of revenue i was just wondering what is the visibility that you have on that i mean is it that you are yet to get your purchase orders and your purchase orders will come later on and that will give you a better feel for what that revenue ramp will look like or do you already have a pretty good feel for how that will look like in terms of volume and asp and if there is any sort of movement in that number is that mainly from a backend capex point of view or would you consider adding frontend capex as well in the second half if the volume required for that and second question is at your mobile world congress presentation i think there was a comment saying that you had a  billion run rate on iot microcontrollers i was just wondering can you put together a number for what is your iot revenue at this point in time if you go through all the different divisions and what would you say the ballpark figure of growth for that business right now carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv maybe janardan i take your question quite quickly to refer like  carlo said during the introduction that the demand environment is very solid and we enter really the next quarter with a very solid backlog on the rest of your question you really want janardan to spoil our capital market day lets have a little bit of content to come on may  on the second half of the year janardan menon  liberum capital ltd okay can i get one more carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv  maybe one comment the visibility is pretty good and i think in this moment we discussed automotive i think the visibility that we have in general with our automotive customers is to grow much faster than the  the pos and distribution is at a record level and inventories are low and we are perfectly on track with our new major programs so the three things are working well so i think we have good confidence to make a substantial step in revenues moving from q to the second half of the year janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you janardan next question please operator the next question is from andrew gardiner from barclays please go ahead andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the question not to belabor the point too much on the second half visibility but you mentioned the sort of key product ramp for the back half of the year i think sort of on the sensing side of things youve also highlighted in the past silicon carbide ramp just hows your visibility there in terms of so the key customer starting in the back half of the year and also can you perhaps shed a little bit more light about engagement elsewhere i think you said you had a win in asia for silicon carbide just how you expect trends to progress there for  and  based on customer engagement carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv we are first of all in the condition to confirm the ramp which is not a major program that we have described and this program is also as we already said is also calling for important capital investment the silicon carbide is an important contributor in the second half is starting i think is pretty nowadays  because it is high volume and we are very proud about this growth on silicon carbide and we see an acceleration of design wins on silicon carbide products in the press release we mentioned this design award in asia but there are many things moving on also in europe this is i believe important to underline so it is a new generation of products and of course there will be a contribution in the second part of this year but we are confident that this contribution will grow materially the next few years andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd thank you carlo carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yes tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you andrew next question please operator the next question is from mathias santos silva from morgan stanley please go ahead mathias santos silva  morgan stanley  co international plc hello thank you for taking my question first regarding to the capex ramp is this entirely related to models to be launched this year or is there also some in there regarding models to be launched next year and also in the application thats going out in the market in the second half that will drive that revenue ramp do you forecast that kind of application going into broadbased smartphone manufacturers as well or is it mostly related to that one customer perhaps thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well capex  carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah on capex as you could expect at the end intense capital spending is at the end addressing all the ill say three relevant objective for us which is to start the new program in the second half of the year is to build capacity for expanding revenues in the second half of the year and preparing a capacity for  and this is almost across all the different process technologies for the company and to serve a growth for all the three product groups in the imaging division or the subset of our business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah to respond to the second question when we talk about this major project of course its not one single device this is obvious and some of the products are certainly suitable for many many customers while some other products are more dedicated to one customer mathias santos silva  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you for that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you mathias next question operator the next question is from robert sanders from deutsche bank please go ahead robert sanders  deutsche bank ag yeah good morning a question for jeanmarc you mentioned you had a capability in structured light i was just wondering what capability you have today in wafer level optics or are you partnering with firms like cda  or hynix and then the second question would just be on the timeofflight youve launched a multiobject multiarray scanner i was just wondering what kind of level of increase of content that could generate versus your simple spadbased proximity sensor today just a sort of multiple would be interesting thanks jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv now what is important when you would like to control this kind of technology is to have the skill the technical skill in the critical component of course in structured light one of the critical components is disfactored  optical elements and you mentioned hynix of course hynix  is one of the key supplier in the world what is important for us is to have the technical skill to understand what are the best components and the best offer in the world it is an example then you have the voxel voxel there is many voxel  many power different power for timeofflight for structured light for us its important to have the skill to be able to know very well the process to assess the capability of the values  and to challenge it  there is also a component like that like the filters lens and so on and so forth so st we have built in our imaging division very strong capability to understand this key components from the bill of material to challenge  and then one of the key capability we have is engineering and manufacturing capability to assemble and test all these components in a module by the way this is what we have demonstrated last year with one component for  customer we have delivered in the course of  so really we have a good control of the supply chain and we have a good control of the manufacturing of this kind of module but then from silicon point of view means the sensors of the timeofflight allinone technology that year we have this is our core competence in term of silicon footprint and we know the technology we are very good on that very aggressive on that and we position ourself for future generation robert sanders  deutsche bank ag great thats helpful and just on the timeofflight i think the current proximity sensors is only a  component the one you shipped into the iphone but i would assume with an array these multipoint timeofflight sensors are significantly higher do you have a sort of rough estimate of how much more content this could generate carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well we cannot comment on the price of course price and complexity are related and also i do not want to comment on the price of the existing solution you mentioned it so certainly not possible for us to comment on the price but clearly with more content more complexity the evolution of the price is in the right direction robert sanders  deutsche bank ag okay thanks a lot carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thanks tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you rob next question please operator the next question is from stéphane houri from natixis please go ahead stéphane houri  natixis sa yes hello good morning carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv good morning stéphane houri  natixis sa i have a question on gross margin because you commented that the unused  charge is very limited so what are the ways to improve the gross margin going further and whats the potential thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well carlo will comment i will say the potential is significant carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv again you note stéphane that already in the guidance for the next quarter we are anticipating at midpoint of the guidance another step of progression i believe really what is nicely coming in as a factor there is that the innovation is making product mix able to somehow compensate the natural or be till the future of  the natural price erosion in the industry and the gross margin can take advantage of higher efficiencies and efficiencies of course is a function on the volume of the fab not only in respect to the absorption of the unused capacity charges that now is fully done but also in respect of the big opportunity of scaling up capacity in the fab going forward when we have entered the year we have anticipated for the second half of the year a very significant contribution to the wafer cost particularly in millimeter from scaling up fabs also associated with the new program and this has really to come for the second half of the year stéphane houri  natixis sa okay thank you and just a follow up if i may looking at your q guidance of  growth could you give us some indication about whats going to happen into the different division which is going to fastest growing and the one who will grow less carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah carlo carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv as usual without characterizing specifically growth by subgroups i may indicate to you whether we expect more solid growth sequentially for the next quarter and this is certainly about the automotive and the micromemories and secure microcontrollers is in its second level for power discrete and analog and in the case of digital will be a further slight erosion associated with the phase out of legacy stéphane houri  natixis sa okay very good thank you very much carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thanks stéphane next question operator the next question is from amit harchandani from citigroup please go ahead amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd good morning amit harchandani from citigroup and thanks for taking my question two if i may my first question would be around trends in the distribution business and also inventory levels across the supply chain could you maybe share your thoughts in terms of the segments how youve seen the trends in distribution evolve as youve gone through the quarter and maybe some initial thoughts on the month of april and then i have a second question after that thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv the visibility well first of all we know while q and i can say that it was unprecedently strong pos with a very healthy situation and this is across the board i have to say that asia is strong but europe that is important for us in distribution of growth is also very very strong even stronger than asia and we do not see any change in april we see a very good trend in the month of april both in terms of bookings and in terms of pos i would like to underline again that the situation of inventory is pretty healthy and of course what we are trying to do here for instance yesterday and the day before yesterday we had a major event in china on our stm we had  participants to this event and this is mostly developers people working with our microcontrollers and building around our microcontrollers with other products and this is exactly what we want to do we want to sell more around our stm so we are encouraged by this trend so we see a good momentum it was strong in q i think somebody mentioned before that our generalpurpose microcontroller it was  billion business or so before i think today the run rate is more  million per quarter and growing and this is i believe it is a fundamental family for our mass market strategy and for our distribution business we want to sell more of the rest of our kits together with our stm so pretty good visibility in distribution amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you for the detailed comments carlo and maybe as a second question i was looking at the press release this morning with respect to the proposal for the new executive team and the creation of the position of deputy ceo just wanted to understand your thoughts behind coming up with this new executive team structure is it in response to what you see out there in the industry and also should we maybe look at the creation of a deputy ceo position as a step in the succession planning thinking one year from now or am i getting a ahead of myself thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah well i think first of all i believe this is a unique opportunity for jeanmarc weve been working with jeanmarc its now many many years in fact since the moment of creation of the company in  so its certainly an important step for jeanmarc i mean jeanmarc in his career managed manufacturing technology certain products and this is a unique opportunity to expand we mentioned in our press release that there will be a more stronger involvement of jeanmarc in sales and marketing so i think hes well deserved times are  getting better and jeanmarc gave an important contribution very important contribution in the turnaround in this area having said that its certainly not up to me to comment on the succession this is not a matter that is discussed at the level of management but is of course is our supervisory board amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd and just the rest of the executive team structure the changes there i just wanted to understand the thought process behind that  carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well there are basically two changes one change is the unification  of the regions i think  of course all the organizations can work very nicely or maybe a little bit less but i think we believe this is the right moment to make the steps some of our customers are of course very very global and this including some of our distributors our presence with distributors is becoming more and more important and of course we also want to make sure that there is a very good global approach in what we do with our global distributors and the other one is somehow related to the promotion of jeanmarc and the promotion of orio bellezza that is taking also the digital technologies on top of what he already has in terms of power and analog technologies the rest is basically continuation and i think he is actual evolution  i think of course the role of jeanmarc is unique for all and i am sure that we will continue with the turnaround we are better but certainly not at the level we want to be and there is the opportunity to make another important steps in the second half of this year and well if you do first of all then in the second half of this year and of course also in  amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much carlo carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you amit next question operator the next question is from lee simpson from stifel please go ahead lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great thanks for letting me on there maybe if i just circle back to opex if i could and sga in particular sga looked pretty steady last year but going into q things have picked up perhaps a little higher than just my modeling but just trying to get a sense for how that pans out to the year and im looking in particular for comments as they relates to restructuring i mean obviously restructuring has been heavy for last two years i just wonder if the restructuring charges having now peaked means the sga the downside or the ability to push sga down has maxed out already thanks carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv i believe the short answer to your question is the status of progression in the settop box restructuring  now at the stage that most of savings are already in about  of the targeted savings are already in the result of the first quarter and certainly the portion still to go is the one that could help going forward to reabsorb the normal inflation dynamic in expenses some strengthening of our firepower  in sales and marketing so at the end as anticipated when we talked in january we see the combination of the completion of the restructuring plan and other ingredients to be substantially offering the company the possibility to keep expenses in this range of the  million net per quarter on one side and on the other side doing so taking a full advantage to the operating margin from the top line growth lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great i guess in summary we can expect some further savings in rd as a result carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv again what we could expect going forward in the next quarter is expenses and  operating expenses to be substantially flattish this is also what we are anticipating with the visibility of the second quarter that will be a few million higher than the first quarter and the third quarter that will be some millions lower than the second quarter and the first quarter lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd got you thats very clear and maybe just circling back to the earlier question i think this one goes to jeanmarc you were very good at giving us detail around the expansion to an array solution in timeofflight but you step back from giving the asp increase in the absence of giving us an asp increase could you give us perhaps the silicon area increase carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv this is even worse lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd well i guess if we can get a ratio on the array itself i mean are going from a  by   to a  millimeter squared solution is that the way to look at this carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv no we cannot comment also of course its never that clear whether we are talking about exactly the same thing it is about the evolution of the timeofflight or is a more complex chipset i already mentioned that we are not talking about one product here and i think its very very complex what i can say is that this is a unique capability that we are  and of course we want to  on this capability and it is coming from all of these specialty technologies that we have developed in imaging and we want to have a very very important return and now we are in the phase of the ramp up we are on track and im sure we can give more information of course during  lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great thanks anyway thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv so stay tuned lee thank you next question please operator the next question is from veysel taze from oddo please go ahead veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions i have one question regarding your mems business it was a little bit difficult to read the development in the mems business if you look at the inventory – or the news flow from china about inventory correction there et cetera but your mems business has grown very strong in q i see the point that samsung you had one additional design win versus the prior generation with the touch controller was that the main driver or are there other factors which drove the business here carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv the touch controller is not reported in the mems the touch controller is reported in our analog so there is no relation i mean of course its reported in amg but you talk about mems so i wanted to be accurate now what we see mems it is strong demand the month of march was pretty strong bookings i have to say that in february with the chinese new year it was a correction but very very strong march booking on mems carlo mentioned before that we will grow sequentially on mems moving into q so the growth yearoveryear will be substantial growth and the priorities are always the same i think we wanted to diversify this business diversify in terms of technologies so not only mems sensors but also mems microactuators we want to diversify in terms of customers so you mentioned samsung but we want to be more spread with many customers including important customers in china and we importantly want to diversify in terms of market segments and i mentioned before that what we do in mems for automotive is not yet the level i believe of the potential that we have in this area and this is certainly an important priority so i tried to give you the three axes diversification in terms of technology diversification in terms of customer base and diversification in terms of market the momentum is good and we see a good trend the month of march was pretty strong and the demand is strong veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag sorry i think i missed – the touch controller is part of which segment carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv analog veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay and second question regarding the gross margin and what carlo ferro mentioned regarding the scaling up of the volumes and the fabs if i look your gross margin profile first half this year versus first half of last year so it seems like around  basis points yearoveryear growth so the question would be what could be the kind of leverage youre trying to get in the second half of the year as indication i mean last year you had roughly  in second half of the year is there – what would be like the opportunity there the  basis points i guess in first half would be too high carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv you see for the time being its nice to see that now is several quarters in a row that each quarter gross margin is   points higher than the prior year quarter carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv so we cannot give the guidance for q i think as i said we believe there are significant opportunities carlo mentioned already very well i mean what is the effect and all  that is a very important thing to do due to the turn of inventory well have a positive effect in q starting from q veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag one final one on your auto business if i may in the auto business you mentioned that growth will accelerate for the rest of the year and if i look at the growth in q it was above  yearend but nevertheless if i look some of the peers they are expecting for this year doubledigit growth in their auto business and also q for some of them look really stronger than your q so any indication how strong this acceleration could be so could we move into doubledigit range or high singledigit carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah well my comment before was yearoveryear and i was saying that when we compare with others we need to take in consideration also the organization of the company and we have products that are important products for automotive that are maybe not in adg or in apg  particularly for instance lets make a couple of examples the silicon carbide growth is certainly for automotive and this will be in adg it will be in the discrete part of adg we expect a strong growth on digital in the automotive and this will be in what we call adg  that is still part of adg but there are other families very important families for us in the automotive as i mentioned before its of course mems there are other companies that are reporting the sensors for automotive together with the business segment for us of course is automotive in terms of customers and this is going to be reported under mems and so if you put all together yearoveryear we want to be close to doubledigit growth yes veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag thanks a lot carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you veysel based on time well take one more question moira operator the last question is from gianmarco bonacina from equita sim please go ahead gianmarco bonacina  equita sim spa yes very good morning just a quick one about car electrification you mentioned new design wins in q i read in the press release in particular there is one on sic mosfet with asian oem can you give a little bit more detail is this in japan or in china and then more broadly can we say that the bill of material for you is pretty similar either if its hybrid or a pure electric or lets say on average there is in lot of  because we are basically trying to track the announcement in terms of new products from the different oems thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well first of all on the customer every time we can mention the customer we tend to do when we cannot we are not in the position of comment on the customer name and we do not do i think what is important for us is the two applications one of course is the inverter and then its the system that is driving the electric model and our proposition here of course is to start replacing igbt with our sic power mos and there are many many power mos per inverter and now i cannot say the number but there are many many power mos per inverter tens of power mos per inverter and this is one opportunity every time there is an inverter so every time there is an electric model in the car so of course including hybrid there is another application where we believe that the sic is also a very good solution is the onboard charger and i think our products are suitable both for the inverter and the onboard charger for the customer ive been told the other day maybe i can say the region not the customer yeah i can say the region of the customer so its china gianmarco bonacina  equita sim spa okay thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you gianmarco tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv at this point well go ahead and wrap up and as carlo mentioned earlier on we will have our capital markets day on may  in london if you need any information on that please contact investor relation and again thank you for participating carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv

improvement of  million and on a yearoveryear basis a swing of  million first half  net income totaled  million free cash flow was  million in the second quarter and  million for the first half this means that we can support our higher level of capital investment in  from our improved cash flow from operations exiting the second quarter our net financial position was  million slightly up from the first quarter and higher by  million compared to one year ago after having distributed  million in dividends to strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility in july we raised  billion at an overall zero cost through a convertible bond offering additionally the combination of the net share settlement option and the ongoing repurchase of the underlining shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes including support for growth and the redemption of our  and  convertible bonds now lets move to a detailed review of our product groups beginning with automotive and discrete our adg adg revenues grew  sequentially performing better than the company average and grew  in comparison to the year ago quarter adgs operating income and operating margin improved sequentially driving adgs second quarter operating margin to  for the first half adg revenues increased  with its operating income up slightly and the operating margin substantially stable at  looking at our product portfolio for automotive we see the increasing silicon content of the latest generation of cars reflected in the number of st components present in new models for example in the new audi a we estimate that we will contribute up to  components coming from all areas of our broad portfolio in the automotive with our focus on technologies and solutions enabling greener driving we won important design wins related to car electrification these included wins for silicon carbide mosfets hightemperature silicon controlled rectifiers and ultrafast diodes from oems as well as from key automotive suppliers semiconductors content for hybrid and electric vehicles is growing fast and we see the potential for over  silicon carbide dice in todays typical electric car we also had a number of design wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience such as an important win for a new generation of airbag platform from a major carsafety technology leader we also won audioamplifier socket with a tier  and we were selected as a partner by a german company for the development of a nextgeneration rear led driver targeting major global carmakers moving to our power discrete business outside automotive here we had design wins for highvoltage super junction devices for battery chargers with leading smartphone makers wins with highvoltage igbts from many global leaders in home appliances and wins with the ultrafast series diodes at top airconditioning makers in our analog and mems groups amg we saw strong revenue growth both sequentially and yearoveryear on a sequential basis revenues increased  driven by both analog and mems products yearoveryear amg revenues were up  on sharply higher mems growth and also strong growth in analog similarly amgs second quarter operating margin saw strong sequential and yearoveryear improvement increasing to  from  and  in the prior and yearago quarters respectively for the firsthalf  amg revenues increased  its operating margin saw a significant turnaround reaching  up from breakeven in the yearago period moving to the amg products our mems sensors achieved a number of important design wins across a diverse range of applications these included motion sensors and magnetometers in pcs and tablet motion sensors for bike application in asia and a axis motion sensor for a top chinese smartphone manufacturer we also received first orders for waterproof pressure sensors for a smartwatch from a leading global brand and won socket for pressure sensors in multiple applications including drones and appliances in addition we enlarged our family of yearlongevity sensors with the introduction of a axis module targeting smart industry applications in sensors for our automotive telematics applications we grew more than  yearoveryear with customers across the globe in wireless connectivity we launched a new systemonchip bluetooth low energy certified and also won multiple designs for a subgigahertz and bluetooth low energy in a range of applications including wearable smart home and smart building automation the performance of our analog business was strong during the second quarter we achieved record quarterly sales in standard and high performance analog product families and we introduced new advanced operational amplifiers to reinforce our position both in industrial and in the automotive our stspin motorcontrol family won numerous sockets globally for a broad range of consumer and industrial motorcontrol applications including d printers textile machines for smart factories but also vacuum cleaners and fan controls wireless charging has been an area of recent investment and during the second quarter we landed a design win for fast wirelesscharging ics in smartphones as well as introducing new multistandard wireless charger ics now let me share some highlights on our microcontrollers and digital ics group mdg which has seen a strong overall improvement in operating result since the start of the year on a sequential basis mdgs revenues increased  and yearoveryear were up  on doubledigit growth of our general purpose microcontrollers offset in part by lower digital ic sales including products undergoing a phaseout mdgs operating margin was  in the second quarter showing sequential improvement and was up sharply compared to the year ago quarter on a yearoveryear basis this improvement reflects on the one hand our strong performance in microcontrollers and on the other our restructuring initiatives that have resulted in a substantial reduction of losses from digital ics first half mdg result further demonstrate the significant progress we have made with revenues increasing  operating income up  million and its operating margin reaching  from  in the first half of  on general purpose microcontrollers we have seen another record quarter in q to further strengthen the stm family product offer and ecosystem we introduced new parts for the stml and this family features advanced capabilities in terms of audio performance and also with this family we can provide the new iot discovery kit indeed to accelerate development of applications with direct connection to the cloud services we also increased our support for smart industry applications with a scalable industrial ethernet platform through a cooperative effort with a german automotive solution provider moving to security we started production of our latest highperformance near field communication controller targeting consumer and mobile security applications we launched a new stpay dualinterface banking solution and announced a solution for iot security based on stsafe trusted platform module in cooperation with security platform incorporation we gained wins for std dynamic rfid tags in washing machines and for str near field communication reader ics for pointofsales terminals from major oems while beginning production ramp of  kilobit eeprom at a top sportswear brand we also launched the stdv dynamic near field communicationrfid tag expansion board for the stm nucleo ecosystem in our custom silicon business we introduced the first european independent design platform dedicated to asics for space applications in lowpower cmos technology in cooperation with the european space agency and the french space agency cnes we also qualified a new fdsoi digital asic for a key networking oem and captured several design wins for optical ics at a key subsystem manufacturer for applications in data centers to complete the review of our products lets now discuss our imaging product division which we report in others as anticipated imaging revenues in the second quarter decreased slightly on a sequential basis to  million while we prepare for the ramp of new programs on a yearoveryear basis imaging revenues increased  in the second quarter and for the first half  rose  to  million driven by sts innovative timeofflight technologies in the second quarter we continue to gain design wins while delivering high volumes of our flightsense timeofflight proximity and ranging sensors to multiple smartphone oems we now have reached cumulative shipments of over  million timeofflight sensors and are in more than  smartphone models from  different oems moving now to our third quarter guidance we anticipate continued progress in revenue growth improvement in our operating performance and higher net income bookings are strong across all product groups and regions and we continue to see healthy inventory level and demand from our pointofsales data based on our current bookings activity and visibility we expect third quarter revenues to increase about  on a sequential basis this represents a yearoveryear growth of about  at the midpoint of our guidance we expect this growth to come from all our businesses regions and sales channels for our three product groups we anticipate revenue growth in the third quarter to reflect higher than normal seasonality in our imaging business we anticipate strong sequential growth as the key new program ramps in q followed by further revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter of this year looking at  overall and based on current visibility we expect our revenues to be at the highend of the range that we gave at the capital market day which was  yearoveryear revenue growth plus or minus  percentage points turning to gross margin we anticipate further expansion in the third quarter to about  at the midpoint leading to strong yearoveryear improvement in operating and net income with respect to our  free cash flow we continue to anticipate it well substantially – that will substantially match the level of our dividend additionally let me share some more specifics on our capital investment plans for  at our capital markets day in may we indicated we were reviewing our capital spending in  above our initial plans of up to  billion based upon a combination of new products and higher customer demand we now anticipate capital investment in  to be in the range of about  billion to  billion this investment will support both  revenues and our future growth programs to conclude at our capital markets day we shared with you our financial performance targets for the second half of  based upon our third quarter guidance and second half ambitions overall we believe st is very well positioned to reach these shortterm financial target my colleagues and i will now be happy to answer your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session the first question is from alex duval from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander duval  goldman sachs international yes good morning everyone many thanks for the question alex duval from goldman sachs just wanted to clarify exactly what automotive revenue you saw overall obviously that spread over several groups thats the first point and then the second one was just on some of the data points youve seen out of automotive semis globally particularly in the us weve seen some semi players and tier  suppliers have some weaker data points but you seem to be pointing to doubledigit growth in coming quarters so just wanted to understand your view on overall global auto end market and any specifics for st many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah with the visibility that we have today we will grow  in our automotive business and the backlog is very strong and its very strong across all technologies this is for our discrete sensors certainly for smart power products microcontrollers and all the complex digital asics for infotainment or the advanced safety and connectivity so its broad range and is strong and of course we understand that there are some fluctuations in the overall volumes but content is increasing and with the visibility that we have today and supported really unprecedentedly strong backlog in the automotive we plan to grow  yearoveryear alexander duval  goldman sachs international thats very clear and just to – i have one quick followup weve seen some data points around wafer pricing increasing yeartodate wondered if you could give a perspective on what that can mean for st to what extent we could see any impacts and how it controlled many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo the manager of procurement carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah good morning everyone indeed at the end of second half of  it will be a period with some upside on the overall price for silicon substrate this will affect us its well incorporated in our gross margin roadmap and the visibility that we are sharing with you with some of this supplier we have early contract so i believe that perhaps it is a little bit less effect than other semiconductor companies because of this reason and overall at the end there are ingredients in our technology manufacturing roadmap that are exposed but clearly the millimeter the millimeter bulk wafers while there are other ingredients like for instance the sisubstrate that became important in our volume as you may expect in the second half of this year that are less exposed to this price evolution alexander duval  goldman sachs international very clear many thanks tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you alex next question please operator the next question is from sandeep deshpande from jpmorgan please go ahead sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi i have two questions if i may thanks for letting me on my first question is regarding your asic business carlo bozotti i mean do you have – are you working with any major smartphone vendors at this point on major asics – in any major asics i mean since last year when you did the restructuring in the settop box business you did move some employees into a power management business and whether you are going to work in power management asics for instance in the smartphone market and my second question carlo ferro is on the other revenues that you report your other operating income losses increased in the second quarter im not entirely sure why that happened given that your gross margin improved annual revenue improved so how do we model that going forward into the latter half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep yes we have asic development of course we have broad range of technologies and we can cover both smart power asics but also digital asics and indeed we have important developments in this area sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc are you talking about the smartphone market carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv no no no yes im talking about the smartphone yes absolutely yes sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep to take your second question help me please is your question about the other revenues in the pl or the revenues for the other group sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc no other group which is where you report imaging and where you historically reported losses associated with under utilization et cetera where it has increased from negative  million in q to negative  million in q as such really carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay okay i see the question of course there are two important ingredients there one is already very evident in our results is the substantial loading of the fab so you make expect that the second quarter result have really a very very minor effect of unused capacity on this line then the result of the imaging division is very much associated with the evolution of the product programs and time to ramp the program i believe its not a surprise that no new program has ramped in the course of the second quarter and this is the reason why revenues in q were sequentially lower than prior quarter and overall the combination of the top line and the network  to support the new program ready to start is the reason driving the operating income for the division in the second quarter we are very confident for the second half of the year for this line sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc understood so this was because of costs which are not covered on new projects understood carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv exactly carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you sandeep thank you next question please operator the next question is from achal sultania from credit suisse please go ahead sir achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd hi good morning thanks for my questions so if i look at your q guidance it implies that revenues are going to grow sequentially about  million can you help us understand like how much of that is going to come from the others category like i know you cant give a precise number but like just give us some sense whether its like  of that incremental growth is driven by others or is it less than  more than  any color around that would be helpful then i have a followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no where you want to go i would be thank to answer that from a news capacity fab loading – our revenues generation but im sure that your question is different and clearly we cannot be as you may understand very very specific on individual line and individual program carlo has already indicated the trend for both the imaging division and the other and overall three product groups – on the other overall three product groups we see a sequential revenues increase higher than normal seasonality and the normal seasonality for us is between  and  so higher means that higher than that and for the imaging division we see a strong increase in the quarter and furthermore increase in acceleration in the fourth quarter upon the view of starting new program and the acceleration of the program more loaded in the fourth quarter than in the third achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thats helpful color thanks and maybe a followup on your sales guidance for the full year obviously youve increased – youre saying now youll probably reach the high end of the range just trying to understand what are the key drivers that is making actually you more confident about that is it mainly autos because i also see that youve raised autos guidance from  to  and probably there is some fx tailwind on the top line as well because of weak dollar are there any other puts and takes around that or carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv to be candid in the answer in respect to what we told you in may i believe the only difference today is about the timing and to gain visibility over timing again we were very confident on the status of the business in may given still seven months to end the year we tend to be a little bit more prudent now we have a visibility with a very reasonable set of expectations to give us comfort towards the high end of this range nothing in particular in respect to specific businesses our area of applications have changed as order  remains quite strong carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv right right and inventory at our distributors really low so it is across the board so it is a good momentum in the three areas that we have the iot the smartphone for us is one area automotive as we said at  and also lets say all of this new applications in the mass market so we have a stronger lets say visibility pretty much across the board from a business point of view but also from a regional point of view achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay great thanks a lot carlo and congratulations for strong results thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you achal next question please operator the next question is from david mulholland from ubs please go ahead david t mulholland  ubs ltd hi thanks for taking the question maybe similar to the vein of the last – first question but we had a fairly clear indication from another supplier into the product ramp in h that the phasing would be a bit more qweighted relative to q on when revenue benefit might be seen from the kind of d sensing in h i wonder if you can comment on whether you see similar trends kind of a bit more qbiased and then secondly on the analog and mems growth that youve seen – or if youd just comment you made a few comments on what have been the drivers behind this but could you help us understand distributionwise has this mostly been recovery in smartphones and the gains at a major asian smartphone oem or is it more diverse and broadbased than that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv again we already gave visibility on what we expect in q and we see then q moving into q now we said that in q our three groups are fast imaging  now they are growing more than seasonal and as we said our seasonality is  to  so this will be higher than that so there will be step of course important step a strong step in imaging and then see for this line an acceleration of the revenues in q now we cannot comment more than that if we go to – now to amg i think here we have a important traction in analog the traction is certain importance in distribution and i think it is either – it is both our general purpose analog on one side but also our more specific industrial and power conversion products including motion control products so this is pretty strong demand through the mass market and the distribution as far as mems is concern automotive is growing very rapidly as we said  but we are not yet at the level that we would like to be in this domain of the mems business i think it is important opportunity for us in the future to sell more of these products to automotive and industrial customers what we are doing on the other end on consumer is of course try to diversify our base clearly in terms of customers with more and more customers particularly in asia but also in terms of product and product categories so its – again its pretty broad i think for us in analog its important to keep going because its a great business both in general purpose highend analog the industrial and power conversion certain products also for computing – for computer peripherals so this for us is important and we have a pretty good visibility here and at mems as i said we want to do more in areas where margins are higher like industrial and automotive and remain well balanced in the smartphone in terms of customers and products david t mulholland  ubs ltd thats great thanks very much carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you david next question please operator the next question is from amit harchandani from citigroup please go ahead amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd good morning everyone amit harchandani from citi and thanks for taking my questions two if i may my first question is with respect to the demand in the quarter could you give us a sense – youve talked about inventories but could you give us a sense for lead times and how they have shaped up theyre stable getting stretched whether you have seen any component shortages and also potentially comment on the linearity of bookings during the quarter and then i have a second followup thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah but certainly lead time are stretchening i mean we have a strong demand the booktobill is very positive and we have seen an acceleration of the bookings in the month of june starting from a level that was already pretty high in april and in may and of course we also have the first three weeks of july i can say that the run rate is pretty good also in the first three weeks of july including last week so the booktobill is good lead time are stretchening and the inventory  distribution are low and the trend of bookings has increased in the month of june and in the month of july compared to the months of april and may amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you and as an unrelated followup could i maybe get some more insight into the design wins you have talked about on the silicon carbide side youve talked about diodes youve talked about mosfets we understand there is a strong win with an automotive customer could you give us a sense for whats driving this is it customers embracing it is it competitive positioning any sort of insight you could give with us which would help us better quantify the opportunity would be most welcome carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah no i think frankly that we are in a good leadership position with our silicon carbide i think we want to make silicon carbide an important industrial program for this year and i think in this respect my opinion of course is that we are leading the market and industrial is more spread and we certainly have opportunity in the industrial field both with diode and with power mos but the volumes and the volume potentials in the automotive are significantly higher so we have an aggressive plan to start i think in q sales contribution is limited however we have an aggressive plan and it is a very very important program for the company to move on from what we have now with inch  inch yields are improving we are moving up and there is a strong determination to make this a successful program during the second half of this year amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you amit next question please operator the next question is from janardan menon from liberum please go ahead janardan menon  liberum capital ltd hi good morning thanks for taking the question i had a question on gross margin for a very strong  quarteronquarter growth and carlo ferro you had previously indicated that you will get a significant benefit from the second half from the increased capacity of the millimeter fab where your cost of production goes down i was just wondering that the  seems a little bit on the low side when you put all that together are there any headwinds that you are facing right now on gross margin and how would you expect the gross margin progression to continue beyond q based on what you know at this point in time i have a followup carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay janardan thank you for the question since that help to highlight also two points around our  guidance on gross margin midpoint this point is again is if i do not mistake this is higher than consensus expectation for the second half and second is the opportunity of progression going forward at the end you have mentioned some of the driver weve discussed at capital markets day about our gross margin evolution through the year the wafer cost particularly millimeter is important as fab ramps there is always a continuing improvement on the learning curve and i believe the ability of taking a full advantage of the scale of the fab at around the  wafer per week will be more evident in the production in the course of the third quarter and as you know there is about a one quarter lag as operating cost manufacturing cost translates into margin out to the inventory cycle so at the end its early to anticipate a gross margin for the fourth quarter there are a number of ingredients and variable also depending clearly on product mix et cetera overall the visibilities that after the  in q the progression towards q will be on the positive direction janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood and just a brief followup on the timeofflight which is in your other division after a big jump in the second half of last year that revenue has sort of flattened out but you are continuously reporting higher number of models and oem on that particular product and now i understand that from the second half that revenue will increase sharply because of the d of the special program but just on the timeofflight itself can you give some reason why that revenue is not really rising as a number of model is that price pressure coming there or what are the dynamics which is happening there jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv hi its jeanmarc speaking thank you for the question we are simply executing timely and according to plan of record of the program and our assessment is consistent with that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i think on the timeofflight we have enormous number of customers in our end of course we are also working on new technologies for the timeofflight so there would be a new wave but we are pretty happy that the growth is impressive in imaging and we are investing a lot for the new initiative this is visible of course in terms of expenses in the pl but we have now sort  the  million business of timeofflight that we want to keep going and we have the opportunity i think its pretty good and its a pretty good business i would say its very good business but in parallel we are investing on new things and this will make – will allow us to make another important step janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you janardan next question please operator the next question is from adithya metuku from bank of america please go ahead adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch yes good morning guys thanks for taking my questions i have a couple of admin questions firstly could you remind us of the proportion of costs in your business that have been hedged over the next four quarters especially given the recent moves in the eurodollar rate and also if you could remind us with the latest impact on your costs from the eurodollar move given all the restructuring and the changes in the business over the last  months or so and then secondly just a quick followup on the recent convertible bond offering if you could give us some color on how we should think about the diluted share count and the impact on buybacks going forward that would be really helpful thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay so i guess both questions are for me carlo the one on the hedging has – overall cogs and operating expenses eurodenominated at the current stage are hedged for the third quarter in the range of the  so on the  effective rate underlying our guidance at the end the margin of volatility is quite limited that will be not about one figure assuming exchange rates that stays at a decent level of  and for the fourth quarter we have now had over  of the overall exposure and on this basis based on current exchange rate at  you may expect for the fourth quarter an effective exchange range of about € per dollar sic  per euro  the second part of the question is an appreciated question as clearly our balance sheet at the end of the months of june still is subject to some evolution on july  we have closed the issuance of the new convertible bond then we are in the process of repurchasing  million shares and we are in the process of redeeming the  convertible bond in respect to this initiative the current status is clearly the issuance of the convertible bond is complete and this also give us the opportunity for an additional  million of financing if we take out the amount we are using to repurchase the underlying shares to convert assuming net share settlement at the end is  billion net amount that came with a zero cost and with zero dilution certainly strengthening the balance sheet of the company and the overall financial flexibility for the company then we have the second ingredient which is the execution of the buyback on the share buyback execution we are at about  of completion so i would expect that when i will talk at the end of q but before in the next month so the program which has been totally completed and in respect to the redemption of the  bond the  million has been – the full amount has been already noticed for conversion we are in the so called observation period which is a day period so by the end of august the redemption of this  million of tax will be reflected to make sure to the story you see  billion of available liquidity  billion in the balance sheet at the end of june on a pro forma basis including the new convert the repurchase of the shares and the redemption of the  bond at this level of liquidity would be about  billion and finally i guess on your question perhaps there is a question about the underlying shares for the shares count and given the utilization of treasury shares to redeem the  bond on one side and the buyback on the other side what you may consider is that at the end of june  million shares were outstanding as treasury shares at the end of september after all this process of refinancing being completed we estimate about  million treasury shares so not bigger changes in the overall effect of treasury shares on the shares count adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch okay very clear thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you adi next question please operator the next question is from jérôme ramel from exane bnp please go ahead jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas yeah good morning a question on your manufacturing could you give us what the capacity utilization rate was also what is the current capacity in call it millimeter and have you already completed the program and the capex increase for this year where is it going exactly thank you jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv so thank you jérôme jeanmarc speaking so to be specific about call it millimeter i have to say that all the equipment  has been basically installed and consigned now and the team is running full speed to reach a capacity about  to  wafer per week in the course of this second half of this year and overall okay the manufacturing machine of  carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and the capex this phase is broad they increase – the increase that we have given or that it was preannounced in fact in the month of may and today there is some form of quantification it is also covering area like our bcd for instance the smart power technologies the silicon carbide typically proprietary technologies because we see important opportunities for the future of course we also said however that this extra capex in terms of cash flow we would – it would be fully compensated by increased ebitda so the cash flow lets say anticipation that we had given would not change no we would certainly cover the distribution of dividends despite the increase in capex jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you and maybe another followup if you are fully loaded today and we should still see revenue growth in q and maybe lets say you have some growth next year how are you going to deal with that do you have extra capacity coming in or are you stretched from a capacity standpoint carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well first of all we have some ambition for q and we are starting to describe the ambition but certainly with what we have in our end in terms of capacity and in terms of the backlog customer programs we have moved quickly from a  billion company to a  billion company this is happening this is happening for real and of course we have opportunity inside st to grow but we also have opportunity with our lets say silicon foundry partners we are working internally as we described today but we are also working externally with a number of technologies traditionally this was on logic the fdsoi as you know embedded flash is also from outside and more recently the perimeter has become wider we have the bcd also now so you see the contribution of important programs with our silicon foundry partners and this increase of capacity internally and our really priorities to make sure that we can make another important step next year in terms of revenues jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you just to make clear carlo with this current capacity you have and your partner fleet with your foundry do you think you can deal with potentially a  billion revenue is that what you said carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i didnt say exactly that i said that with the silicon foundry partners we can certainly exceed the  billion jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv if i can jérôme on a more i would say technical standpoint help on the subject i believe that we are not referring to any target of guidance for next year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sure carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv which is clearly too early however certainly the initial question about the limitation of our revenues growth in respect to the current utilization of capacity we tried to put in the right context because there are a number of ingredients that will support and could support together with the demand expanding revenues as carlo said the sourcing of silicon from a foundry the fact that full use of capacity in full steam it moves  then takes one quarter to translate into wafers out in our cycle the fact that we are accelerating capital expenditure when you compare the  billion  billion guidance for the year to the about  million spent in the first half youll see that there is a lot that we are receiving in these days which clearly will increase capacity and then obviously there is also on the inventory cycle so its not so mathematical it certainly is not flex  jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you jérôme next question operator the next question is from francois meunier from morgan stanley please go ahead francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc thanks for taking my questions yes just a bit more precisions around the silicon carbide mosfets socket wins in which region was that was that in germany and are you seeing the more traditional competitor there trying to come back on the silicon carbide thats the first question second question on the gross margin actually you know like that was a question you had earlier i think the guidance for q is pretty good it looks like its a  drop through on incremental revenues compared to  in q so thats pretty good so i think carlo you say that q would potentially be even better so is that basically because you expect the drop through to increase to  or above in q and just two other questions if i may any intent to use the  billion convert youve raised at a very very good price to increase you capabilities in vcsel and also – and im sorry thats the fourth question im really sorry have you heard of any double ordering taking place at the moment end of q beginning of q at any of your distributors or oems thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv okay so there are many question maybe carlo youll start carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv on the gross margin carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv so i think the one on the gross margin unfortunately francois with little ability of adding in respect to what we have already anticipated and saw the opportunity of a further progression in the fourth  quarter than to quantify it at this stage is a bit premature as you could expect it then the other of your questions was on utilization on the proceeds from the convertible bond for what was the question is francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc if you were willing to buy into vcsel capabilities for your d sensors jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv no no no no no we have always positioned ourselves very clear about vcsel you have many many vcsel type okay big one big  so its  like a strategic agreement with supplier and this is basically what we are doing and we have done to support our imaging growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv in general as you said francois thank you for saying that at the end we have raised money at very effective terms and this grant is the reason why we tapped the market and the philosophy that its better to go to take money from the market when its easily and the cheap as opposed of when you actually need so i would encourage not at all reading across the convert in to read the strategic or investment move in for the company really its been more opportunistic than strategically needed and of course financial flexibility in semiconductor is always a great asset to support the growth carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and then i think the last part is on sic right francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc yes from which region and if you saw your more traditional competitor on power semis for autos reacting to your progress in silicon carbide carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv of course i believe that we will see well see we will  its no doubt i think this is a great opportunity for st but it is a great opportunity for some of our competitors and we need to keep that going with innovation the industrialization et cetera so i expect that there will be a strong effort from our competitors to be successful in this very very important business frankly we are working on the three regions i think its something that i can mention because it is publicly known and is about china in china we have signed an agreement to contribute this is with a consortium and they are carmakers battery maker also research centers research institution in china this is for the management of the battery for electric vehicles i believe this is something that i can mention because it is publicly known i think its a good opportunity of course with our bcd technology but also for our silicon carbide but we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in germany and we are working also in united states francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you and any sign of hearing on any double ordering in microcontrollers or any standard parts carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think there is more than double ordering i think what we see is anticipation of orders particularly on microcontrollers to make sure that the backlog is wellcovered also for instance for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year we know of course very well that on certain family the booktobill ratio that we are experiencing is not sustainable but i think what we see is an effort to make sure that there is a good coverage in the backlog of our customers not just for q or as part of q but on a longer frame of time francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you francois next question please operator the next question is from andrew gardiner from barclays please go ahead andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning gentlemen thank you for taking the question i had another one on the capex side of things yeah i take your point that demand is strong and so it is – the rise in capex is covered by sort of broadbased demand but if i go back to some of the comments you made earlier this year so when we first saw the initial increase in capex there were portions of the  budgets that were quite clearly allocated to a specific project im just wondering whether now that were in the middle part of the year were going to see some of these ramp in the back half how is your visibility into  improving for these particular areas and i go back to some of the points you made carlo ferro about sort of ensuring that you are going to get sort of multiyear returns on the investment being made just sort of further visibility into  would be helpful and ive just got a quick modeling followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv absolutely carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah andrew at the end the capex level in  is clearly higher than what we have expected entering the year but also the revenues for the year are well higher than what we were expecting and we are really in a process of realigning capacity to demand and increasing sourcing from silicon foundry in parallel in order on one side to meet demand and on the other side to maintain or to increase flexibility for our manufacturing machine recognizing that clearly the semiconductor industry remains overall exposed to some level of silica  so this is i would say quite wise and wellbalanced move then as this evolution continues so far to be positive based on current visibility  could be another year important in term of overall capital expenditure however frankly its very very early at this stage to anticipate the way that capital sourcing is execute in this industry is always at the appropriate level of modularity in order to adjust up or down depending on the evolution of the demand depending on the design win clearly today also in carlos introduction you had a good picture of not only strong demand but the flow of design wins which is important in all and across the various technologies including in the area of analog and power technology and this is the reason for accelerating capital expenditure andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you and gentlemen just a quick followup in terms of opex modeling previously youd guided to the  million per quarter on average through the year can we assume that was the normal seasonality in opex sort of lower in q and then higher in q but does that average still hold for the year or is it moving a bit higher given the revenue growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv for the current quarter ill say no major surprise in respect to the gross operating expenses in sga and in rd clearly there is more activity the exchange rate is not as you noted in favor the seasonality plays in favor overall what you may expect is that this quarter is a level of operating income lower than what is the normal  million to  million we report each quarter carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not operating income carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no other income sorry of other income and expenses sorry thank you carlo of other income and expenses here on other income and expenses at the end you may expect a few million dollar of contribution so overall at the end the net operating expenses for q would be slightly north of the  million of our target range then moving forward in q you may expect some increase due to seasonality and exchange rate on the gross expenses the other income and expenses to go back to the usual  million to  million and as a result of that we may be a few tenths of million dollar maximum above the  million reference andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd thats very clear thank you carlo tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv next question please operator the next question is from robert sanders from deutsche bank please go ahead robert sanders  deutsche bank ag yeah hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question i just wanted to come back to a previous question about capacity so if you were given a new order for a special program for second half  lets say at the end of this year how would you serve that if it was lets say an fdsoi ramp are you saying that you would serve that via foundries or are you saying that you would migrate embedded flash out of crolles and into foundries to clear the decks for that and i guess i have the same question for silicon carbide in the sense that thats currently on a inch line at catania is there clean room space to ramp that up or would you need to do something with the inch capacity thats there as well thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well lets start from the silicon carbide no the silicon carbide will stay inside okay we do not have any plan to outsource the silicon carbide at all so as you know at the end of last year we moved from  to  inches and we run this in our inch module in catania and we intend to continue the growth of this line in catania on the other hand on the inch in catania the intention is to move more and more production as we already described to asia to singapore for us on the first part of the question while its a combination of the two of course we are building up flexibility lets put in this way i mean you mentioned two important areas of flexibility on flexibility you mentioned flexibility on embedded flash and you mentioned flexibility on fdsoi and of course this is part of the whole manufacturing strategy we must work from this and we must increase this level of flexibility and it is exactly the same for bcd we want to have more flexibility also on the bcd so as we said before it would be a combination of internal investment but also a more extensive use of outsource okay so flexibility in fdsoi flexibility in embedded flash on a number of generational technologies flexibility on bcd but certainly lets say on a technology pack fdsoi particularly in this space everything is and will remain inside but flexibility to reduce the inch in catania moving the traditional production to singapore and making more space for the fdsoi in case its needed robert sanders  deutsche bank ag got it and just following up on that so then no plans for a new clean room anytime soon in order to expand your capacity internally carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not for new buildings we have always opportunity to use our infrastructure better and our lets say ambition is of course to build up more when we need in terms of capacity using what we have that is i believe possible and of course to continue to drive down the wafer cost robert sanders  deutsche bank ag thanks a lot tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thanks rob next question please operator the next question is from mr veysel taze from oddo please go ahead veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah hi good morning veysel taze from oddo most of the questions have been addressed maybe one question regarding your auto business and the seasonality in the second half of the year i mean your silicon carbide design win is ramping up in q so do you expect in q further seasonality growth in your auto business and then on your silicon carbide business can you share with us your design win potential of what you have right now similar to the auto microcontroller and how that has changed throughout the first half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv so again on the silicon carbide the ramp is now the contribution to revenues in q is limited we expect to have an important step in q of this year and importantly we see lets say significant opportunities to grow next year i think more in general in the automotive as i was mentioning before we see also a good drive in the following areas number one on this smart power technologies okay number two our microcontrollers dedicated to automotive im talking about the microcontrollers that we have in adg and number three the complex digital asics that we now sell particularly for advanced safety applications so we see a good momentum on this three technology clients for automotive so we expect an acceleration of the performance of our specific automotive group that is part of adg – of course its apg the automotive product group now part of adg we see an acceleration of the growth in the second part of this year but across the board in terms of technology coverage this – i think it was probably is responding to all your questions veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah the thing is also – i guess in q there will be another sequential growth versus q then on the silicon carbide really like in your auto microcontroller you have this  billion design win potential you mentioned but – and just to get a color on the silicon carbide as theres a lot of moving parts there what would you see your current design win there just to quantify that if its possible for you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv but its not possible for me i mean i made the project and example from china because i can mention there was a press release i can – unfortunately we are working in the three regions so we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in europe and we are working in united states but i cannot give more color i mean i tried before to give more color to this initiative in china that is important initiatives there are six or seven  that are pooling on the electric cars initiative and really we have won them the battery management system and i believe we can contribute with our technologies including silicon carbide but i cannot say more on other customers because of course its confidential veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay and then just a quick followup on your distribution business i think in h it was  of revenues what is your growth expectations for the entire year in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well in q it was  in q its  so we said these two times  but in q it was  our distribution point pop the billing and our billing to distribution customers but more importantly of course is the evolution of pointofsales the pointofsale is sequentially moving from q to q improved by  percentage point and if i look yearoveryear q over q the pointofsales increased  well we want to keep going the inventory are low even too low so we want to keep going with the pointofsales i think we have two priorities in distribution one priority is to make sure that the stm is more and more sticky and we have more and more products around the stm and of course this is demand creation and cooperating with our distributors on the demand creation and the second priority is the expansion of the customer base to have more and more customers and of course we are consistent i believe we have a strategy in distribution that is very consistent and we want to keep going with this level of performance in the pos and hopefully contributing a little bit more to the replenishment of the inventory with our distributors that are too low veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag so to come back on that one what is in your  growth yearoveryear revenue in the distribution part what is your yearoveryear growth would you assume here in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv we prefer veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag i think you mentioned the  on first half but what would be for the entire year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think this is an area where of course we need to be careful to provide information because this is not only us but it is also the sales of our distribution our ambition is to keep growing with this level of growth across the board so thats one  what will be the growth at the year end last year was pretty positive it was certainly very solid doubledigits in  and we want to repeat the performance this year i think we do not have any sign of change and we want to keep going but i think it is – it will be not appropriate for us to give a pos forecast now a pointofsales forecast for our distributors veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay thank you thanks a lot gentlemen tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv okay based on time well take one more question please operator the last question is from lee simpson from stifel please go ahead lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in most of my questions have been asked but maybe if i could ask a couple of future questions just as it relates to the investments for the technology cycle so okay question one really around that wide bandgap semi space obviously coming into power quite notably via silicon carbide including opportunities with china but it looks to us that the sweet spot is emerging right across the voltage range for the need for higher efficiency transistors even in appliance charging so im just trying to understand how far do your ambitions go maybe in the next three to five years with wide bandgap semis would gallium nitride feature at some point and what sort of ip datasets would you be looking for second question – sorry quick one just on digital optics for the datacenters you mentioned some uptick there i think in design wins could you maybe just elaborate on that are we talking about new transceiver products for gpon that sort of thing or are we talking about perhaps pivoting to new materials like indium phosphide thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah well for the first one yes i think we have important ambition we are also working on gallium nitride we are not at the level in gallium nitride as we are in the silicon carbide but it is an important program in rd you are perfectly right we talk a lot about automotive but this is broad i think we see particularly with in the area of home appliances air conditioning systems a lot of opportunities for this kind of technology so really a lot of opportunities and we see opportunities of course also in the industry  the industrial internet so i think it is an important pillar of our strategy and we want to do much more there and for us where our igbt presence is more limited i think the silicon carbide and the innovation in the silicon carbide it is a great opportunity to make a step forward in this area to respond to the second part of the question no i think the bulk of this design win it is more on very advanced bicmos technologies that are used by our customers as we mentioned i think in my address before to build up subsystems including optical subsystems to be used for instance in datacenters but it is very advanced bicmos technologies and with this kind of technologies we can certainly contribute and this is mostly asics we can certainly contribute in the optical application as we said or lets say datacenters for instance but also in the new areas like the g we have a wave of asic products again on bicmos technologies pretty advanced bicmos technologies for g applications so just to respond to your question lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great thanks thats a very frank answer thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv

stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter and first half earnings conference call our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results by product group our outlook for the third quarter and our ambitions for the second half overall before beginning i want to welcome our deputy ceo jeanmarc chery to his new role which officially started on july nd i look forward to working even more closely with jeanmarc and with our strong executive team to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth lets start now with our financial review as you have seen we are putting together quarters of successive improvement in our financial results the second quarter delivered further improvement with strong sequential and yearoveryear revenue growth and with operating income and net income following the same trajectory revenues increased  sequentially a better than seasonal performance and  basis points above the midpoint of our guidance on a yearoveryear basis revenues increased  with growth coming from all product groups and sales channels in the internet of things and smartphones we continue to win business with our complete portfolio of microcontrollers sensors analog and power management connectivity and secure solutions and iot our distribution channel plays a key role with point of sales in the second quarter growing  yearoveryear distribution represented  of our revenues in q in smart driving we continue to capture opportunities both with products developed in our automotive and discrete group as well as with products such as sensors and general purpose analogs which are developed by other groups and fit the need of automotive customers with our present visibility we expect our overall automotive business to grow by about  in  for the first half of  sts quarterly revenues were  billion up  gross margin was  in the second quarter  basis points above the midpoint of our range on a sequential basis gross margin increased by  basis points positively impacted by favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by price erosion on a yearoveryear basis gross margin increased by  basis points reflecting manufacturing efficiencies improved fab loading and a favorable product mix partially offset by normal price pressure operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased to  million representing an operating margin of  thanks to our product and profit initiatives driving operating leverage better product mix and manufacturing efficiencies on a sequential and yearoveryear basis operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased by  million and  million respectively net income in the second quarter was up sharply to  million representing a sequential improvement of  million and on a yearoveryear basis a swing of  million first half  net income totaled  million free cash flow was  million in the second quarter and  million for the first half this means that we can support our higher level of capital investment in  from our improved cash flow from operations exiting the second quarter our net financial position was  million slightly up from the first quarter and higher by  million compared to one year ago after having distributed  million in dividends to strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility in july we raised  billion at an overall zero cost through a convertible bond offering additionally the combination of the net share settlement option and the ongoing repurchase of the underlining shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes including support for growth and the redemption of our  and  convertible bonds now lets move to a detailed review of our product groups beginning with automotive and discrete our adg adg revenues grew  sequentially performing better than the company average and grew  in comparison to the year ago quarter adgs operating income and operating margin improved sequentially driving adgs second quarter operating margin to  for the first half adg revenues increased  with its operating income up slightly and the operating margin substantially stable at  looking at our product portfolio for automotive we see the increasing silicon content of the latest generation of cars reflected in the number of st components present in new models for example in the new audi a we estimate that we will contribute up to  components coming from all areas of our broad portfolio in the automotive with our focus on technologies and solutions enabling greener driving we won important design wins related to car electrification these included wins for silicon carbide mosfets hightemperature silicon controlled rectifiers and ultrafast diodes from oems as well as from key automotive suppliers semiconductors content for hybrid and electric vehicles is growing fast and we see the potential for over  silicon carbide dice in todays typical electric car we also had a number of design wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience such as an important win for a new generation of airbag platform from a major carsafety technology leader we also won audioamplifier socket with a tier  and we were selected as a partner by a german company for the development of a nextgeneration rear led driver targeting major global carmakers moving to our power discrete business outside automotive here we had design wins for highvoltage super junction devices for battery chargers with leading smartphone makers wins with highvoltage igbts from many global leaders in home appliances and wins with the ultrafast series diodes at top airconditioning makers in our analog and mems groups amg we saw strong revenue growth both sequentially and yearoveryear on a sequential basis revenues increased  driven by both analog and mems products yearoveryear amg revenues were up  on sharply higher mems growth and also strong growth in analog similarly amgs second quarter operating margin saw strong sequential and yearoveryear improvement increasing to  from  and  in the prior and yearago quarters respectively for the firsthalf  amg revenues increased  its operating margin saw a significant turnaround reaching  up from breakeven in the yearago period moving to the amg products our mems sensors achieved a number of important design wins across a diverse range of applications these included motion sensors and magnetometers in pcs and tablet motion sensors for bike application in asia and a axis motion sensor for a top chinese smartphone manufacturer we also received first orders for waterproof pressure sensors for a smartwatch from a leading global brand and won socket for pressure sensors in multiple applications including drones and appliances in addition we enlarged our family of yearlongevity sensors with the introduction of a axis module targeting smart industry applications in sensors for our automotive telematics applications we grew more than  yearoveryear with customers across the globe in wireless connectivity we launched a new systemonchip bluetooth low energy certified and also won multiple designs for a subgigahertz and bluetooth low energy in a range of applications including wearable smart home and smart building automation the performance of our analog business was strong during the second quarter we achieved record quarterly sales in standard and high performance analog product families and we introduced new advanced operational amplifiers to reinforce our position both in industrial and in the automotive our stspin motorcontrol family won numerous sockets globally for a broad range of consumer and industrial motorcontrol applications including d printers textile machines for smart factories but also vacuum cleaners and fan controls wireless charging has been an area of recent investment and during the second quarter we landed a design win for fast wirelesscharging ics in smartphones as well as introducing new multistandard wireless charger ics now let me share some highlights on our microcontrollers and digital ics group mdg which has seen a strong overall improvement in operating result since the start of the year on a sequential basis mdgs revenues increased  and yearoveryear were up  on doubledigit growth of our general purpose microcontrollers offset in part by lower digital ic sales including products undergoing a phaseout mdgs operating margin was  in the second quarter showing sequential improvement and was up sharply compared to the year ago quarter on a yearoveryear basis this improvement reflects on the one hand our strong performance in microcontrollers and on the other our restructuring initiatives that have resulted in a substantial reduction of losses from digital ics first half mdg result further demonstrate the significant progress we have made with revenues increasing  operating income up  million and its operating margin reaching  from  in the first half of  on general purpose microcontrollers we have seen another record quarter in q to further strengthen the stm family product offer and ecosystem we introduced new parts for the stml and this family features advanced capabilities in terms of audio performance and also with this family we can provide the new iot discovery kit indeed to accelerate development of applications with direct connection to the cloud services we also increased our support for smart industry applications with a scalable industrial ethernet platform through a cooperative effort with a german automotive solution provider moving to security we started production of our latest highperformance near field communication controller targeting consumer and mobile security applications we launched a new stpay dualinterface banking solution and announced a solution for iot security based on stsafe trusted platform module in cooperation with security platform incorporation we gained wins for std dynamic rfid tags in washing machines and for str near field communication reader ics for pointofsales terminals from major oems while beginning production ramp of  kilobit eeprom at a top sportswear brand we also launched the stdv dynamic near field communicationrfid tag expansion board for the stm nucleo ecosystem in our custom silicon business we introduced the first european independent design platform dedicated to asics for space applications in lowpower cmos technology in cooperation with the european space agency and the french space agency cnes we also qualified a new fdsoi digital asic for a key networking oem and captured several design wins for optical ics at a key subsystem manufacturer for applications in data centers to complete the review of our products lets now discuss our imaging product division which we report in others as anticipated imaging revenues in the second quarter decreased slightly on a sequential basis to  million while we prepare for the ramp of new programs on a yearoveryear basis imaging revenues increased  in the second quarter and for the first half  rose  to  million driven by sts innovative timeofflight technologies in the second quarter we continue to gain design wins while delivering high volumes of our flightsense timeofflight proximity and ranging sensors to multiple smartphone oems we now have reached cumulative shipments of over  million timeofflight sensors and are in more than  smartphone models from  different oems moving now to our third quarter guidance we anticipate continued progress in revenue growth improvement in our operating performance and higher net income bookings are strong across all product groups and regions and we continue to see healthy inventory level and demand from our pointofsales data based on our current bookings activity and visibility we expect third quarter revenues to increase about  on a sequential basis this represents a yearoveryear growth of about  at the midpoint of our guidance we expect this growth to come from all our businesses regions and sales channels for our three product groups we anticipate revenue growth in the third quarter to reflect higher than normal seasonality in our imaging business we anticipate strong sequential growth as the key new program ramps in q followed by further revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter of this year looking at  overall and based on current visibility we expect our revenues to be at the highend of the range that we gave at the capital market day which was  yearoveryear revenue growth plus or minus  percentage points turning to gross margin we anticipate further expansion in the third quarter to about  at the midpoint leading to strong yearoveryear improvement in operating and net income with respect to our  free cash flow we continue to anticipate it well substantially – that will substantially match the level of our dividend additionally let me share some more specifics on our capital investment plans for  at our capital markets day in may we indicated we were reviewing our capital spending in  above our initial plans of up to  billion based upon a combination of new products and higher customer demand we now anticipate capital investment in  to be in the range of about  billion to  billion this investment will support both  revenues and our future growth programs to conclude at our capital markets day we shared with you our financial performance targets for the second half of  based upon our third quarter guidance and second half ambitions overall we believe st is very well positioned to reach these shortterm financial target my colleagues and i will now be happy to answer your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session the first question is from alex duval from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander duval  goldman sachs international yes good morning everyone many thanks for the question alex duval from goldman sachs just wanted to clarify exactly what automotive revenue you saw overall obviously that spread over several groups thats the first point and then the second one was just on some of the data points youve seen out of automotive semis globally particularly in the us weve seen some semi players and tier  suppliers have some weaker data points but you seem to be pointing to doubledigit growth in coming quarters so just wanted to understand your view on overall global auto end market and any specifics for st many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah with the visibility that we have today we will grow  in our automotive business and the backlog is very strong and its very strong across all technologies this is for our discrete sensors certainly for smart power products microcontrollers and all the complex digital asics for infotainment or the advanced safety and connectivity so its broad range and is strong and of course we understand that there are some fluctuations in the overall volumes but content is increasing and with the visibility that we have today and supported really unprecedentedly strong backlog in the automotive we plan to grow  yearoveryear alexander duval  goldman sachs international thats very clear and just to – i have one quick followup weve seen some data points around wafer pricing increasing yeartodate wondered if you could give a perspective on what that can mean for st to what extent we could see any impacts and how it controlled many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo the manager of procurement carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah good morning everyone indeed at the end of second half of  it will be a period with some upside on the overall price for silicon substrate this will affect us its well incorporated in our gross margin roadmap and the visibility that we are sharing with you with some of this supplier we have early contract so i believe that perhaps it is a little bit less effect than other semiconductor companies because of this reason and overall at the end there are ingredients in our technology manufacturing roadmap that are exposed but clearly the millimeter the millimeter bulk wafers while there are other ingredients like for instance the sisubstrate that became important in our volume as you may expect in the second half of this year that are less exposed to this price evolution alexander duval  goldman sachs international very clear many thanks tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you alex next question please operator the next question is from sandeep deshpande from jpmorgan please go ahead sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi i have two questions if i may thanks for letting me on my first question is regarding your asic business carlo bozotti i mean do you have – are you working with any major smartphone vendors at this point on major asics – in any major asics i mean since last year when you did the restructuring in the settop box business you did move some employees into a power management business and whether you are going to work in power management asics for instance in the smartphone market and my second question carlo ferro is on the other revenues that you report your other operating income losses increased in the second quarter im not entirely sure why that happened given that your gross margin improved annual revenue improved so how do we model that going forward into the latter half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep yes we have asic development of course we have broad range of technologies and we can cover both smart power asics but also digital asics and indeed we have important developments in this area sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc are you talking about the smartphone market carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv no no no yes im talking about the smartphone yes absolutely yes sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep to take your second question help me please is your question about the other revenues in the pl or the revenues for the other group sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc no other group which is where you report imaging and where you historically reported losses associated with under utilization et cetera where it has increased from negative  million in q to negative  million in q as such really carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay okay i see the question of course there are two important ingredients there one is already very evident in our results is the substantial loading of the fab so you make expect that the second quarter result have really a very very minor effect of unused capacity on this line then the result of the imaging division is very much associated with the evolution of the product programs and time to ramp the program i believe its not a surprise that no new program has ramped in the course of the second quarter and this is the reason why revenues in q were sequentially lower than prior quarter and overall the combination of the top line and the network  to support the new program ready to start is the reason driving the operating income for the division in the second quarter we are very confident for the second half of the year for this line sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc understood so this was because of costs which are not covered on new projects understood carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv exactly carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you sandeep thank you next question please operator the next question is from achal sultania from credit suisse please go ahead sir achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd hi good morning thanks for my questions so if i look at your q guidance it implies that revenues are going to grow sequentially about  million can you help us understand like how much of that is going to come from the others category like i know you cant give a precise number but like just give us some sense whether its like  of that incremental growth is driven by others or is it less than  more than  any color around that would be helpful then i have a followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no where you want to go i would be thank to answer that from a news capacity fab loading – our revenues generation but im sure that your question is different and clearly we cannot be as you may understand very very specific on individual line and individual program carlo has already indicated the trend for both the imaging division and the other and overall three product groups – on the other overall three product groups we see a sequential revenues increase higher than normal seasonality and the normal seasonality for us is between  and  so higher means that higher than that and for the imaging division we see a strong increase in the quarter and furthermore increase in acceleration in the fourth quarter upon the view of starting new program and the acceleration of the program more loaded in the fourth quarter than in the third achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thats helpful color thanks and maybe a followup on your sales guidance for the full year obviously youve increased – youre saying now youll probably reach the high end of the range just trying to understand what are the key drivers that is making actually you more confident about that is it mainly autos because i also see that youve raised autos guidance from  to  and probably there is some fx tailwind on the top line as well because of weak dollar are there any other puts and takes around that or carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv to be candid in the answer in respect to what we told you in may i believe the only difference today is about the timing and to gain visibility over timing again we were very confident on the status of the business in may given still seven months to end the year we tend to be a little bit more prudent now we have a visibility with a very reasonable set of expectations to give us comfort towards the high end of this range nothing in particular in respect to specific businesses our area of applications have changed as order  remains quite strong carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv right right and inventory at our distributors really low so it is across the board so it is a good momentum in the three areas that we have the iot the smartphone for us is one area automotive as we said at  and also lets say all of this new applications in the mass market so we have a stronger lets say visibility pretty much across the board from a business point of view but also from a regional point of view achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay great thanks a lot carlo and congratulations for strong results thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you achal next question please operator the next question is from david mulholland from ubs please go ahead david t mulholland  ubs ltd hi thanks for taking the question maybe similar to the vein of the last – first question but we had a fairly clear indication from another supplier into the product ramp in h that the phasing would be a bit more qweighted relative to q on when revenue benefit might be seen from the kind of d sensing in h i wonder if you can comment on whether you see similar trends kind of a bit more qbiased and then secondly on the analog and mems growth that youve seen – or if youd just comment you made a few comments on what have been the drivers behind this but could you help us understand distributionwise has this mostly been recovery in smartphones and the gains at a major asian smartphone oem or is it more diverse and broadbased than that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv again we already gave visibility on what we expect in q and we see then q moving into q now we said that in q our three groups are fast imaging  now they are growing more than seasonal and as we said our seasonality is  to  so this will be higher than that so there will be step of course important step a strong step in imaging and then see for this line an acceleration of the revenues in q now we cannot comment more than that if we go to – now to amg i think here we have a important traction in analog the traction is certain importance in distribution and i think it is either – it is both our general purpose analog on one side but also our more specific industrial and power conversion products including motion control products so this is pretty strong demand through the mass market and the distribution as far as mems is concern automotive is growing very rapidly as we said  but we are not yet at the level that we would like to be in this domain of the mems business i think it is important opportunity for us in the future to sell more of these products to automotive and industrial customers what we are doing on the other end on consumer is of course try to diversify our base clearly in terms of customers with more and more customers particularly in asia but also in terms of product and product categories so its – again its pretty broad i think for us in analog its important to keep going because its a great business both in general purpose highend analog the industrial and power conversion certain products also for computing – for computer peripherals so this for us is important and we have a pretty good visibility here and at mems as i said we want to do more in areas where margins are higher like industrial and automotive and remain well balanced in the smartphone in terms of customers and products david t mulholland  ubs ltd thats great thanks very much carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you david next question please operator the next question is from amit harchandani from citigroup please go ahead amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd good morning everyone amit harchandani from citi and thanks for taking my questions two if i may my first question is with respect to the demand in the quarter could you give us a sense – youve talked about inventories but could you give us a sense for lead times and how they have shaped up theyre stable getting stretched whether you have seen any component shortages and also potentially comment on the linearity of bookings during the quarter and then i have a second followup thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah but certainly lead time are stretchening i mean we have a strong demand the booktobill is very positive and we have seen an acceleration of the bookings in the month of june starting from a level that was already pretty high in april and in may and of course we also have the first three weeks of july i can say that the run rate is pretty good also in the first three weeks of july including last week so the booktobill is good lead time are stretchening and the inventory  distribution are low and the trend of bookings has increased in the month of june and in the month of july compared to the months of april and may amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you and as an unrelated followup could i maybe get some more insight into the design wins you have talked about on the silicon carbide side youve talked about diodes youve talked about mosfets we understand there is a strong win with an automotive customer could you give us a sense for whats driving this is it customers embracing it is it competitive positioning any sort of insight you could give with us which would help us better quantify the opportunity would be most welcome carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah no i think frankly that we are in a good leadership position with our silicon carbide i think we want to make silicon carbide an important industrial program for this year and i think in this respect my opinion of course is that we are leading the market and industrial is more spread and we certainly have opportunity in the industrial field both with diode and with power mos but the volumes and the volume potentials in the automotive are significantly higher so we have an aggressive plan to start i think in q sales contribution is limited however we have an aggressive plan and it is a very very important program for the company to move on from what we have now with inch  inch yields are improving we are moving up and there is a strong determination to make this a successful program during the second half of this year amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you amit next question please operator the next question is from janardan menon from liberum please go ahead janardan menon  liberum capital ltd hi good morning thanks for taking the question i had a question on gross margin for a very strong  quarteronquarter growth and carlo ferro you had previously indicated that you will get a significant benefit from the second half from the increased capacity of the millimeter fab where your cost of production goes down i was just wondering that the  seems a little bit on the low side when you put all that together are there any headwinds that you are facing right now on gross margin and how would you expect the gross margin progression to continue beyond q based on what you know at this point in time i have a followup carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay janardan thank you for the question since that help to highlight also two points around our  guidance on gross margin midpoint this point is again is if i do not mistake this is higher than consensus expectation for the second half and second is the opportunity of progression going forward at the end you have mentioned some of the driver weve discussed at capital markets day about our gross margin evolution through the year the wafer cost particularly millimeter is important as fab ramps there is always a continuing improvement on the learning curve and i believe the ability of taking a full advantage of the scale of the fab at around the  wafer per week will be more evident in the production in the course of the third quarter and as you know there is about a one quarter lag as operating cost manufacturing cost translates into margin out to the inventory cycle so at the end its early to anticipate a gross margin for the fourth quarter there are a number of ingredients and variable also depending clearly on product mix et cetera overall the visibilities that after the  in q the progression towards q will be on the positive direction janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood and just a brief followup on the timeofflight which is in your other division after a big jump in the second half of last year that revenue has sort of flattened out but you are continuously reporting higher number of models and oem on that particular product and now i understand that from the second half that revenue will increase sharply because of the d of the special program but just on the timeofflight itself can you give some reason why that revenue is not really rising as a number of model is that price pressure coming there or what are the dynamics which is happening there jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv hi its jeanmarc speaking thank you for the question we are simply executing timely and according to plan of record of the program and our assessment is consistent with that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i think on the timeofflight we have enormous number of customers in our end of course we are also working on new technologies for the timeofflight so there would be a new wave but we are pretty happy that the growth is impressive in imaging and we are investing a lot for the new initiative this is visible of course in terms of expenses in the pl but we have now sort  the  million business of timeofflight that we want to keep going and we have the opportunity i think its pretty good and its a pretty good business i would say its very good business but in parallel we are investing on new things and this will make – will allow us to make another important step janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you janardan next question please operator the next question is from adithya metuku from bank of america please go ahead adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch yes good morning guys thanks for taking my questions i have a couple of admin questions firstly could you remind us of the proportion of costs in your business that have been hedged over the next four quarters especially given the recent moves in the eurodollar rate and also if you could remind us with the latest impact on your costs from the eurodollar move given all the restructuring and the changes in the business over the last  months or so and then secondly just a quick followup on the recent convertible bond offering if you could give us some color on how we should think about the diluted share count and the impact on buybacks going forward that would be really helpful thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay so i guess both questions are for me carlo the one on the hedging has – overall cogs and operating expenses eurodenominated at the current stage are hedged for the third quarter in the range of the  so on the  effective rate underlying our guidance at the end the margin of volatility is quite limited that will be not about one figure assuming exchange rates that stays at a decent level of  and for the fourth quarter we have now had over  of the overall exposure and on this basis based on current exchange rate at  you may expect for the fourth quarter an effective exchange range of about € per dollar sic  per euro  the second part of the question is an appreciated question as clearly our balance sheet at the end of the months of june still is subject to some evolution on july  we have closed the issuance of the new convertible bond then we are in the process of repurchasing  million shares and we are in the process of redeeming the  convertible bond in respect to this initiative the current status is clearly the issuance of the convertible bond is complete and this also give us the opportunity for an additional  million of financing if we take out the amount we are using to repurchase the underlying shares to convert assuming net share settlement at the end is  billion net amount that came with a zero cost and with zero dilution certainly strengthening the balance sheet of the company and the overall financial flexibility for the company then we have the second ingredient which is the execution of the buyback on the share buyback execution we are at about  of completion so i would expect that when i will talk at the end of q but before in the next month so the program which has been totally completed and in respect to the redemption of the  bond the  million has been – the full amount has been already noticed for conversion we are in the so called observation period which is a day period so by the end of august the redemption of this  million of tax will be reflected to make sure to the story you see  billion of available liquidity  billion in the balance sheet at the end of june on a pro forma basis including the new convert the repurchase of the shares and the redemption of the  bond at this level of liquidity would be about  billion and finally i guess on your question perhaps there is a question about the underlying shares for the shares count and given the utilization of treasury shares to redeem the  bond on one side and the buyback on the other side what you may consider is that at the end of june  million shares were outstanding as treasury shares at the end of september after all this process of refinancing being completed we estimate about  million treasury shares so not bigger changes in the overall effect of treasury shares on the shares count adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch okay very clear thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you adi next question please operator the next question is from jérôme ramel from exane bnp please go ahead jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas yeah good morning a question on your manufacturing could you give us what the capacity utilization rate was also what is the current capacity in call it millimeter and have you already completed the program and the capex increase for this year where is it going exactly thank you jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv so thank you jérôme jeanmarc speaking so to be specific about call it millimeter i have to say that all the equipment  has been basically installed and consigned now and the team is running full speed to reach a capacity about  to  wafer per week in the course of this second half of this year and overall okay the manufacturing machine of  carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and the capex this phase is broad they increase – the increase that we have given or that it was preannounced in fact in the month of may and today there is some form of quantification it is also covering area like our bcd for instance the smart power technologies the silicon carbide typically proprietary technologies because we see important opportunities for the future of course we also said however that this extra capex in terms of cash flow we would – it would be fully compensated by increased ebitda so the cash flow lets say anticipation that we had given would not change no we would certainly cover the distribution of dividends despite the increase in capex jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you and maybe another followup if you are fully loaded today and we should still see revenue growth in q and maybe lets say you have some growth next year how are you going to deal with that do you have extra capacity coming in or are you stretched from a capacity standpoint carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well first of all we have some ambition for q and we are starting to describe the ambition but certainly with what we have in our end in terms of capacity and in terms of the backlog customer programs we have moved quickly from a  billion company to a  billion company this is happening this is happening for real and of course we have opportunity inside st to grow but we also have opportunity with our lets say silicon foundry partners we are working internally as we described today but we are also working externally with a number of technologies traditionally this was on logic the fdsoi as you know embedded flash is also from outside and more recently the perimeter has become wider we have the bcd also now so you see the contribution of important programs with our silicon foundry partners and this increase of capacity internally and our really priorities to make sure that we can make another important step next year in terms of revenues jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you just to make clear carlo with this current capacity you have and your partner fleet with your foundry do you think you can deal with potentially a  billion revenue is that what you said carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i didnt say exactly that i said that with the silicon foundry partners we can certainly exceed the  billion jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv if i can jérôme on a more i would say technical standpoint help on the subject i believe that we are not referring to any target of guidance for next year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sure carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv which is clearly too early however certainly the initial question about the limitation of our revenues growth in respect to the current utilization of capacity we tried to put in the right context because there are a number of ingredients that will support and could support together with the demand expanding revenues as carlo said the sourcing of silicon from a foundry the fact that full use of capacity in full steam it moves  then takes one quarter to translate into wafers out in our cycle the fact that we are accelerating capital expenditure when you compare the  billion  billion guidance for the year to the about  million spent in the first half youll see that there is a lot that we are receiving in these days which clearly will increase capacity and then obviously there is also on the inventory cycle so its not so mathematical it certainly is not flex  jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you jérôme next question operator the next question is from francois meunier from morgan stanley please go ahead francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc thanks for taking my questions yes just a bit more precisions around the silicon carbide mosfets socket wins in which region was that was that in germany and are you seeing the more traditional competitor there trying to come back on the silicon carbide thats the first question second question on the gross margin actually you know like that was a question you had earlier i think the guidance for q is pretty good it looks like its a  drop through on incremental revenues compared to  in q so thats pretty good so i think carlo you say that q would potentially be even better so is that basically because you expect the drop through to increase to  or above in q and just two other questions if i may any intent to use the  billion convert youve raised at a very very good price to increase you capabilities in vcsel and also – and im sorry thats the fourth question im really sorry have you heard of any double ordering taking place at the moment end of q beginning of q at any of your distributors or oems thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv okay so there are many question maybe carlo youll start carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv on the gross margin carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv so i think the one on the gross margin unfortunately francois with little ability of adding in respect to what we have already anticipated and saw the opportunity of a further progression in the fourth  quarter than to quantify it at this stage is a bit premature as you could expect it then the other of your questions was on utilization on the proceeds from the convertible bond for what was the question is francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc if you were willing to buy into vcsel capabilities for your d sensors jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv no no no no no we have always positioned ourselves very clear about vcsel you have many many vcsel type okay big one big  so its  like a strategic agreement with supplier and this is basically what we are doing and we have done to support our imaging growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv in general as you said francois thank you for saying that at the end we have raised money at very effective terms and this grant is the reason why we tapped the market and the philosophy that its better to go to take money from the market when its easily and the cheap as opposed of when you actually need so i would encourage not at all reading across the convert in to read the strategic or investment move in for the company really its been more opportunistic than strategically needed and of course financial flexibility in semiconductor is always a great asset to support the growth carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and then i think the last part is on sic right francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc yes from which region and if you saw your more traditional competitor on power semis for autos reacting to your progress in silicon carbide carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv of course i believe that we will see well see we will  its no doubt i think this is a great opportunity for st but it is a great opportunity for some of our competitors and we need to keep that going with innovation the industrialization et cetera so i expect that there will be a strong effort from our competitors to be successful in this very very important business frankly we are working on the three regions i think its something that i can mention because it is publicly known and is about china in china we have signed an agreement to contribute this is with a consortium and they are carmakers battery maker also research centers research institution in china this is for the management of the battery for electric vehicles i believe this is something that i can mention because it is publicly known i think its a good opportunity of course with our bcd technology but also for our silicon carbide but we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in germany and we are working also in united states francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you and any sign of hearing on any double ordering in microcontrollers or any standard parts carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think there is more than double ordering i think what we see is anticipation of orders particularly on microcontrollers to make sure that the backlog is wellcovered also for instance for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year we know of course very well that on certain family the booktobill ratio that we are experiencing is not sustainable but i think what we see is an effort to make sure that there is a good coverage in the backlog of our customers not just for q or as part of q but on a longer frame of time francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you francois next question please operator the next question is from andrew gardiner from barclays please go ahead andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning gentlemen thank you for taking the question i had another one on the capex side of things yeah i take your point that demand is strong and so it is – the rise in capex is covered by sort of broadbased demand but if i go back to some of the comments you made earlier this year so when we first saw the initial increase in capex there were portions of the  budgets that were quite clearly allocated to a specific project im just wondering whether now that were in the middle part of the year were going to see some of these ramp in the back half how is your visibility into  improving for these particular areas and i go back to some of the points you made carlo ferro about sort of ensuring that you are going to get sort of multiyear returns on the investment being made just sort of further visibility into  would be helpful and ive just got a quick modeling followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv absolutely carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah andrew at the end the capex level in  is clearly higher than what we have expected entering the year but also the revenues for the year are well higher than what we were expecting and we are really in a process of realigning capacity to demand and increasing sourcing from silicon foundry in parallel in order on one side to meet demand and on the other side to maintain or to increase flexibility for our manufacturing machine recognizing that clearly the semiconductor industry remains overall exposed to some level of silica  so this is i would say quite wise and wellbalanced move then as this evolution continues so far to be positive based on current visibility  could be another year important in term of overall capital expenditure however frankly its very very early at this stage to anticipate the way that capital sourcing is execute in this industry is always at the appropriate level of modularity in order to adjust up or down depending on the evolution of the demand depending on the design win clearly today also in carlos introduction you had a good picture of not only strong demand but the flow of design wins which is important in all and across the various technologies including in the area of analog and power technology and this is the reason for accelerating capital expenditure andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you and gentlemen just a quick followup in terms of opex modeling previously youd guided to the  million per quarter on average through the year can we assume that was the normal seasonality in opex sort of lower in q and then higher in q but does that average still hold for the year or is it moving a bit higher given the revenue growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv for the current quarter ill say no major surprise in respect to the gross operating expenses in sga and in rd clearly there is more activity the exchange rate is not as you noted in favor the seasonality plays in favor overall what you may expect is that this quarter is a level of operating income lower than what is the normal  million to  million we report each quarter carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not operating income carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no other income sorry of other income and expenses sorry thank you carlo of other income and expenses here on other income and expenses at the end you may expect a few million dollar of contribution so overall at the end the net operating expenses for q would be slightly north of the  million of our target range then moving forward in q you may expect some increase due to seasonality and exchange rate on the gross expenses the other income and expenses to go back to the usual  million to  million and as a result of that we may be a few tenths of million dollar maximum above the  million reference andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd thats very clear thank you carlo tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv next question please operator the next question is from robert sanders from deutsche bank please go ahead robert sanders  deutsche bank ag yeah hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question i just wanted to come back to a previous question about capacity so if you were given a new order for a special program for second half  lets say at the end of this year how would you serve that if it was lets say an fdsoi ramp are you saying that you would serve that via foundries or are you saying that you would migrate embedded flash out of crolles and into foundries to clear the decks for that and i guess i have the same question for silicon carbide in the sense that thats currently on a inch line at catania is there clean room space to ramp that up or would you need to do something with the inch capacity thats there as well thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well lets start from the silicon carbide no the silicon carbide will stay inside okay we do not have any plan to outsource the silicon carbide at all so as you know at the end of last year we moved from  to  inches and we run this in our inch module in catania and we intend to continue the growth of this line in catania on the other hand on the inch in catania the intention is to move more and more production as we already described to asia to singapore for us on the first part of the question while its a combination of the two of course we are building up flexibility lets put in this way i mean you mentioned two important areas of flexibility on flexibility you mentioned flexibility on embedded flash and you mentioned flexibility on fdsoi and of course this is part of the whole manufacturing strategy we must work from this and we must increase this level of flexibility and it is exactly the same for bcd we want to have more flexibility also on the bcd so as we said before it would be a combination of internal investment but also a more extensive use of outsource okay so flexibility in fdsoi flexibility in embedded flash on a number of generational technologies flexibility on bcd but certainly lets say on a technology pack fdsoi particularly in this space everything is and will remain inside but flexibility to reduce the inch in catania moving the traditional production to singapore and making more space for the fdsoi in case its needed robert sanders  deutsche bank ag got it and just following up on that so then no plans for a new clean room anytime soon in order to expand your capacity internally carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not for new buildings we have always opportunity to use our infrastructure better and our lets say ambition is of course to build up more when we need in terms of capacity using what we have that is i believe possible and of course to continue to drive down the wafer cost robert sanders  deutsche bank ag thanks a lot tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thanks rob next question please operator the next question is from mr veysel taze from oddo please go ahead veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah hi good morning veysel taze from oddo most of the questions have been addressed maybe one question regarding your auto business and the seasonality in the second half of the year i mean your silicon carbide design win is ramping up in q so do you expect in q further seasonality growth in your auto business and then on your silicon carbide business can you share with us your design win potential of what you have right now similar to the auto microcontroller and how that has changed throughout the first half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv so again on the silicon carbide the ramp is now the contribution to revenues in q is limited we expect to have an important step in q of this year and importantly we see lets say significant opportunities to grow next year i think more in general in the automotive as i was mentioning before we see also a good drive in the following areas number one on this smart power technologies okay number two our microcontrollers dedicated to automotive im talking about the microcontrollers that we have in adg and number three the complex digital asics that we now sell particularly for advanced safety applications so we see a good momentum on this three technology clients for automotive so we expect an acceleration of the performance of our specific automotive group that is part of adg – of course its apg the automotive product group now part of adg we see an acceleration of the growth in the second part of this year but across the board in terms of technology coverage this – i think it was probably is responding to all your questions veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah the thing is also – i guess in q there will be another sequential growth versus q then on the silicon carbide really like in your auto microcontroller you have this  billion design win potential you mentioned but – and just to get a color on the silicon carbide as theres a lot of moving parts there what would you see your current design win there just to quantify that if its possible for you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv but its not possible for me i mean i made the project and example from china because i can mention there was a press release i can – unfortunately we are working in the three regions so we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in europe and we are working in united states but i cannot give more color i mean i tried before to give more color to this initiative in china that is important initiatives there are six or seven  that are pooling on the electric cars initiative and really we have won them the battery management system and i believe we can contribute with our technologies including silicon carbide but i cannot say more on other customers because of course its confidential veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay and then just a quick followup on your distribution business i think in h it was  of revenues what is your growth expectations for the entire year in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well in q it was  in q its  so we said these two times  but in q it was  our distribution point pop the billing and our billing to distribution customers but more importantly of course is the evolution of pointofsales the pointofsale is sequentially moving from q to q improved by  percentage point and if i look yearoveryear q over q the pointofsales increased  well we want to keep going the inventory are low even too low so we want to keep going with the pointofsales i think we have two priorities in distribution one priority is to make sure that the stm is more and more sticky and we have more and more products around the stm and of course this is demand creation and cooperating with our distributors on the demand creation and the second priority is the expansion of the customer base to have more and more customers and of course we are consistent i believe we have a strategy in distribution that is very consistent and we want to keep going with this level of performance in the pos and hopefully contributing a little bit more to the replenishment of the inventory with our distributors that are too low veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag so to come back on that one what is in your  growth yearoveryear revenue in the distribution part what is your yearoveryear growth would you assume here in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv we prefer veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag i think you mentioned the  on first half but what would be for the entire year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think this is an area where of course we need to be careful to provide information because this is not only us but it is also the sales of our distribution our ambition is to keep growing with this level of growth across the board so thats one  what will be the growth at the year end last year was pretty positive it was certainly very solid doubledigits in  and we want to repeat the performance this year i think we do not have any sign of change and we want to keep going but i think it is – it will be not appropriate for us to give a pos forecast now a pointofsales forecast for our distributors veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay thank you thanks a lot gentlemen tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv okay based on time well take one more question please operator the last question is from lee simpson from stifel please go ahead lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in most of my questions have been asked but maybe if i could ask a couple of future questions just as it relates to the investments for the technology cycle so okay question one really around that wide bandgap semi space obviously coming into power quite notably via silicon carbide including opportunities with china but it looks to us that the sweet spot is emerging right across the voltage range for the need for higher efficiency transistors even in appliance charging so im just trying to understand how far do your ambitions go maybe in the next three to five years with wide bandgap semis would gallium nitride feature at some point and what sort of ip datasets would you be looking for second question – sorry quick one just on digital optics for the datacenters you mentioned some uptick there i think in design wins could you maybe just elaborate on that are we talking about new transceiver products for gpon that sort of thing or are we talking about perhaps pivoting to new materials like indium phosphide thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah well for the first one yes i think we have important ambition we are also working on gallium nitride we are not at the level in gallium nitride as we are in the silicon carbide but it is an important program in rd you are perfectly right we talk a lot about automotive but this is broad i think we see particularly with in the area of home appliances air conditioning systems a lot of opportunities for this kind of technology so really a lot of opportunities and we see opportunities of course also in the industry  the industrial internet so i think it is an important pillar of our strategy and we want to do much more there and for us where our igbt presence is more limited i think the silicon carbide and the innovation in the silicon carbide it is a great opportunity to make a step forward in this area to respond to the second part of the question no i think the bulk of this design win it is more on very advanced bicmos technologies that are used by our customers as we mentioned i think in my address before to build up subsystems including optical subsystems to be used for instance in datacenters but it is very advanced bicmos technologies and with this kind of technologies we can certainly contribute and this is mostly asics we can certainly contribute in the optical application as we said or lets say datacenters for instance but also in the new areas like the g we have a wave of asic products again on bicmos technologies pretty advanced bicmos technologies for g applications so just to respond to your question lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great thanks thats a very frank answer thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv
