fixed income securities our approach to fixed income investing balances the desire to generate a reliable stream of income for our clients and confidence that the principal amount invested will be repaid against the risks associated with committing capital for a fixed rate of return our view of the macroeconomic environment together with the potential interest rate risk and credit risk is critical to our strategic approach to fixed income investing alternative private investments certain clients have expressed their desire to allocate a portion of their capital into private alternative investments through our relationships from time to time we see interesting alternative investment opportunities such as real estate and private equity and we introduce such ideas to clients these

investment vehicles impact investing financial planning for individuals insights contact us client portal menu postgreen bonds impact investing with fixed income whats newfinancial planninginvesting and marketsnewsroomquarterly commentary by matthew blume cfa share   march   the financial services industry is constantly developing new products to serve the everchanging wants and needs of a diverse array of investors while wall street financial innovation often leads to problems eg the exotic mortgage debt instruments that helped fuel the  financial crisis investment banks occasionally launch new products worthy of investor’s attention we think green bonds are an interesting product that is worth considering green bonds like traditional bonds are fixed income instruments that are used by governments companies and ngos to raise capital through the debt markets their structure is not fundamentally different from the corporate bonds government bonds and municipal bonds with which many of us are familiar however green bonds differ from traditional bonds in that the issuers of green bonds publicly state that the capital raised through the issue will fund projects assets or business activities with an environmental benefit these activities might include renewable energy sustainable forestry or energyefficiency projects to name a few examples also capital might be used to fund projects with social or community benefits such as improving social services or increasing accessibility to healthcare in order to provide transparency to bondholders green bond issuers typically provide periodic reporting on the use of funds and project success though such reporting is not currently a requirement while green bonds are a relatively new phenomenon the first green bond was issued in  by the european investment bank the global green bond market has grown from  million in  to an estimated  billion at the end of  with new issuers and investors continuing to enter the market the total value of green bonds outstanding is expected to climb as high as  billion worldwide by the end of  while there is currently no standardized set of criteria for what qualifies a bond as “green” we expect this to change as the market develops several international organizations have developed guidelines that issuers are encouraged to follow in order to be able to label their bonds as “green” we expect that a single international green bond standard will emerge in the near future which should only add to the credibility and size of the green bond market for example apple inc recently entered the green bond market issuing  billion in bonds in february  with the proceeds used to finance renewable energy energy storage and energy efficiency projects green buildings and resource conservation efforts apple is undertaking these projects in order to reduce the company’s carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of its supply chain in issuing these bonds apple developed a green bond framework which was reviewed by a third party consultancy while ernst  young was hired to conduct an annual audit to determine how the bond proceeds were used at pekin singer strauss asset management we have been helping our clients align their investment portfolios with their personal values for many years and we continue to make this an integral part of our investment process we have deep experience in valuesbased and socially responsible investing that has given us unique insight into how environmental social and governance esg factors can be integrated into investment analysis for some clients this has meant avoiding certain companies or industries while for others it has meant investing in private impactfocused alternative investments green bonds provide yet another opportunity for our clients to direct their capital in ways that align with their values in order to help our clients capitalize on the opportunities that green bonds represent we have developed relationships with several bond vendors who maintain substantial inventories of green bonds that we can purchase for our clients who wish to be involved in this type of investment if you are
