use the seahorse products whenever we can learning and developing as we go our team is committed to delivering the ultimate beach kontiki fishing experience using equipment that is second to none call us to discuss your fishing requirements and we will be able to recommend the perfect solution for you history kontiki fishing is a traditional form of fishing from the pacific islands including new zealand the new zealanders have made it a enjoyable pastime which has been popular since the s and possibly earlier originally kontiki fishing used sail rafts or inflated tyres with sails to pull lines from the beach and these early lines had a hundred or more hooks on each set given the success we have now with only up to  hooks it makes you wonder what they did with all the fish the southwesterly winds that are common in the bay of plenty new zealand and with its long sandy beaches provided the perfect conditions for the development of the early sail kontikis and they proved this style of fishing could be very successful  these early kontiki units had interesting systems to improve their performance including using sugar sweets as timers and dropping sails to make the retrieval easier the sweets would slowly dissolve in the water and once dissolved the kontiki sail would drop sometimes releasing a weight to anchor the fishing line once the wind powered kontiki was well offshore however there was always the problem with the children eating the sweets on the way to the beach during the s and s kite fishing became a popular method of beach fishing and due to the improved performance it almost took over from the sail rafts method but kites still suffered the same problems of having to rely on offshore winds to operate and these generally only happened midweek when you were at work motorised kontikis have been around in numerous homemade forms since before the s all of which tried to overcome the problem of relying on the wind motorising the kontiki and winch created their own problems in general the machines were temperamental and required the knack of the builder to keep them running from the late s a number of these homebuilders started selling their units in small numbers but none of them provided the performance and reliability demanded by the fishing public this is where seahorse kontikis stepped in our story seahorse kontikis started developing and selling electric kontikis and winches in  with the desire to build and sell reliable electric kontikis calling on the best commercial fishing practices and using the best marine electronics available seahorse kontikis developed the first seahorse kontiki system with a lb thrust motor with waterproof components reliability and performance that outstripped anything else available the seahorse system became an instant best seller within six months seahorse had become the number one kontiki manufacturer in new zealand and the world in  seahorse introduced the plastic rotomoulded body made from polyethylene and a new improved control unit the control unit monitored the status of the batteries and had an electronic timer this was what the new zealand public was waiting for and these improvements resulted in seahorse kontikis being used everywhere in  the seahorse  kontiki was developed and released to the market replacing the existing kontiki with a more powerful motor it quickly became the kontiki of choice and excelled in big surf conditions allowing fishers to explore new fishing grounds the aluminium framed traceboard was also introduced enabling traces to be attached quickly and safely   the years rolled pass with continuous improvements being made to the seahorse products finally in  the gps seahorse  kontiki was released the the fishing public to much acclaim finally a kontiki unit that would steer itself where you wanted it to go it the gps seahorse  became an immediate best seller as it gave the fishers exactly what they wanted  saw the first gps seahorse kontiki sold to a customer in the usa which was quickly followed by more as the word spread about this new and successful form of fishing because of this increasing demand seahorse usa has been created to to provide these customers with the service and support they deserve  in  seahorse had sold kontikis into over  coutries around the world including france japan australia and our first sale to the usa this was the first of many and finally in  seahorse will have be based in georgia and we will be able to provide the same high standard of service to our customers in the usa plus it gives tracey and myself a great reason to spend time on some ofthe best beaches in the world  has seen a new model become avaliable the new seahorse s powered by a lithium

call and we will tell you what you do and dont need for the shorething fishing system you wont need clip on weights a hook section in your mainline a meter leader line or a trace rack and traces this could save you up to  from your kontiki package the shorething kontiki fishing system is a fully automatic longline setting device that is towed behind your existing kontiki and sets the hooks far away from the mainline when sharks bite through the hook section you only lose a few dollars worth of hooks instead of between  to  dollars worth of kontiki hook section and leader line the shorething is a dropper rig system that deploys a  hook baited longline offshore when a timer releases the weight on the end of the hook section the  ounces of weight anchors the kontiki much more securely than any other system the weights are dispersed along the hook section and this dramatically reduces any risk of tangles in the hook section video  setting up and baiting  uretiti beach catches video  reloading the hook reel uretiti beach catches video  hauling in good catches at glinks gully video  shorething expert denis bradley fishing at uretiti beach the shorething kontiki dropper rig has these advantages advantage  sharks biting through hook section if you have a shorething kontiki fishing system the chances of losing your kontiki as a result of sharks biting through your hook section is very very low because of the much greater distance between the hooked shark and the critical mainline if you dont have a shorething and a shark bites through your hook section then you cannot recover your kontiki from the beach with your mainline if you cant get someone with a boat to rescue it the kontiki is lost according to customer reports and our vast experience with kite longlines a very similar system to a conventional kontiki rig it appears that well over half of conventional kontikis lost are due to shark biteoffs advantage  snagged and broken hook section snagged hook sections are the second most common cause of kontiki loss if your kg to kg mainline is in good condition the snagged kg hook section of the shorething will either break through abrasion on the snag or the kg dropline will break you will still be able to recover the kontiki as usual as with any kontiki you still have to keep your mainline in tip top condition if you have a conventional kontiki and snag the hook section you are stuck until you break the mainline and lose the kontiki if you can get a boat to rescue it note a few other kontikis are cut off by boat propellers and vehicles driving through the mainlines on the beaches both of these are avoidable if you take care where and when you set and keep your gear near the waters edge and not with mainlines spanning the entire width of the beach as some do if just the mainline of a shorething or conventional kontiki rig goes under a ledge or submerged tree the chances of losing either is still the same so we do not recommend fishing the shorething in snaggy areas advantage  less drag the shorethingis easier to tow out than a conventional kontiki hook section and leader line despite the fact that it carries far more weight to better anchor the kontiki against the rip in our tow trials we used a boat with a gps to tow the gear and always towed the same stretch of water consecutively most lb thrust kontikis set between two and three knots the conventional hook section in the test was  meters of kg line  ounces of weight  x  oz and an  kg  hook prestoppered hook section baited with  average sized baits the shorething as tested had a  hook longline aboard baited with average sized baits  ounces of weight on the hook section and a  meter dropline the shorething had around half the drag of a conventional hook section at normal kontiki setting speeds of two to three knots many beaches have steep offshore banks that are quite shallow a conventional kontiki hook section can get bogged or really struggle to get the line over the bank as the mainline weights and following hook section bulldoze into the bank and bury deep into the sand the drag from this can be enough to spoil the set or run the batteries flat before the gear has reached the fishing area if the weights are left off to get over the bank then drift when set becomes an even greater problem with the conventional kontiki system the shorething floats everything well above the bank and the unweighted mainline free from heavy weights and bulky baited traces and clips slides easily up and over the offshore banks while carrying plenty of weight aboard to anchor everything at the preset fishing distance advantage  set further out the normal length of a leader line on a kontiki is  meters this means when set to  meters the furthermost hook out is  meters offshore on the same  meter set with a shorething the furthermost out hook is  meters offshore advantage  better anchoring the shorething usually carries  ounces of lead it can carry more as the weight is onboard the shorething it does not have to be dragged along the bottom on the way out when set the  ounces is distributed along the length of the hook section with heavier weights at each end this weighting pattern acts like a chain and is very efficient and tangle resistant a thin wire grapple or large breakout sinkers on a safety trace can also be added to the very end of the hook section if greater anchoring capability is required advantage  beat drifting weed some areas suffer drifting weed red weed sack weed sea lettuce which can form into clumps over the baited hooks when setting a conventional kontiki usually fish will seldom be caught when the weed is around the hooks or covering the bait this weed is often in a belt near the beach theshorething kontiki fishing system will always set the hooks clean of weed at the desired distance offshore and often beyond the affected area you will still catch weed on the way back in but it will be much less than the conventional system as you have only passed through the weed belt once on the way in best of all you have a much better chance of catching fish because your baited hooks were weed free while the gear was fishing advantage  better catch rates when using shorething kontiki fishing systemthe baits are not dragged over the seabed for one to two kilometres before fishing commences the baits are carried aboard the shorething and are set in tiptop condition right where you have decided to set the extra weight on the shorething hook section further enhances catch rates advantage  stress free fishing once the gear is out you can relax the gear is very well anchored and your kontiki is vastly safer than a conventional system even if sharks bite through your hook section or you snag the hook section however you will still need to keep the reel near the waters edge and avoid areas where there are snags boats are active or commercial fishers set nets lines and crab pots etc advantage  you dont need a trace rack or hook section in your mainline mainline maintenance is a breeze you just need bare line wound onto a winch or beach reel you dont need a trace rack or clip on traces either as everything to do with fishing is always stored on the shorething so if you are thinking of buying a kontiki rig give us a call and we will tell you what you do and dont need for the shorething fishing
