bertelsmann as one of the few nonjewish media companies shut down by the national socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the companys shutdown as a publisher of the resistance could not be proven historian

and s increasingly entered into the field of light fiction during the third reich the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable bertelsmann volksausgaben peoples editions in particular war adventure books such as werner von langsdorffs fliegerbuch on aviation were a commercial success heinrich mohn belonged to the patrons circle of the paramilitary schutzstaffel organization and sought to turn his company into a national socialist model enterprise during world war ii the c bertelsmann verlag became a leading supplier to the wehrmacht even surpassing the

reich the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable bertelsmann volksausgaben peoples editions in particular war adventure books such as werner von langsdorffs fliegerbuch on aviation were a commercial success heinrich mohn belonged to the patrons circle of the paramilitary schutzstaffel organization and sought to turn his company into a national socialist model enterprise during world war ii the c bertelsmann verlag became a leading supplier to the wehrmacht even surpassing the central publishing house of the nsdap franz eher especially in the years between  and  the

employees which led to a trial in   to edit after world war ii the company portrayed itself to the allied control authority as a christian publisher that was part of the resistance to nazism and allegedly persecuted ties to national socialist organizations were initially denied after it became known that erroneous or at least inadequate statements had been made heinrich mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house reinhard mohn one of his three sons took over the c bertelsmann verlag as hans heinrich mohn had been killed in the war and sigbert mohn was still a prisoner of war in

bertelsmann as one of the few nonjewish media companies shut down by the national socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the companys shutdown as a publisher of the resistance could not be proven historian volker ullrich proclaimed in the weekly die zeit that the notion of the companys being a resistance publisher was clearly baseless the files of the ihc have been publicly available in the company

corporation is the c bertelsmann verlag a publishing house established in  by carl bertelsmann in gütersloh carl bertelsmann was a representative of the mindenravensberger erweckungsbewegung a protestant revival movement whose writings he published the c bertelsmann verlag originally specialized in theological literature expanded its publications to include school and textbooks and in the s and s increasingly entered into the field of light fiction during the third reich the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable bertelsmann volksausgaben peoples editions in particular war adventure books such as werner von langsdorffs fliegerbuch on aviation were a commercial success heinrich mohn belonged to the patrons circle of the paramilitary schutzstaffel organization and sought to turn his company into a national socialist model enterprise during world war ii the c bertelsmann verlag became a leading supplier to the wehrmacht even surpassing the central publishing house of the nsdap franz eher especially in the years between  and  the revenues of the c bertelsmann verlag skyrocketed jewish slave laborers were not forced to work in gütersloh but in printing plants in lithuania with which the c bertelsmann verlag cooperated in  the reichsschrifttumskammer reich chamber of literature closed the publishing house to mobilize all powers for victory another essential reason for this was criminal paper racketeering by some publishers employees which led to a trial in   to edit after world war ii the company portrayed itself to the allied control authority as a christian publisher that was part of the resistance to nazism and allegedly persecuted ties to national socialist organizations were initially denied after it became known that erroneous or at least inadequate statements had been made heinrich mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house reinhard mohn one of his three sons took over the c bertelsmann verlag as hans heinrich mohn had been killed in the war and sigbert mohn was still a prisoner of war in  the allies finally granted the company a publishing license after the currency reform in  there was a market slump in the book trade that also led to the next existential crisis for the c bertelsmann verlag under these conditions in  bertelsmann launched the lesering book club to stimulate sales the customers ordered books via subscription and in return received discounted prices the business increasingly shifted from the publishing house to the sale of books which was decisive to further growth in  the c bertelsmann verlag was restructured from that point on theological literature was published in the gütersloher verlagshaus a new publishing house which was consolidated with the rufer verlag fiction poetry and art came under the roof of sigbert mohn verlag the c bertelsmann verlag focused on nonfiction books in particular dictionaries guidebooks reference books and journals the s and s bertelsmann expanded its activities into new business areas thus  the company entered the music market with the bertelsmann schallplattenring record club two years later ariola one of the most successful german record labels was launched and virtually at the same time the sonopress record pressing plant was established with the kommissionshaus buch  ton book and audio commissioning company from which the vereinigte verlagsauslieferung vva emerged bertelsmann laid the cornerstone for its service business in  bertelsmann purchases the already brokenup ufa from the deutsche bank and built on its presence in cinema and television in  bertelsmann acquired shares in the magazine publisher gruner  jahr a merger with axel springer also planned at the time for which a loan for millions had been taken out temporarily from westdeutsche landesbank failed in   to edit portrait of reinhard mohn  from  bertelsmann operated as a jointstock company aktiengesellschaft the increasingly diversifying book publishers were bundled in the verlagsgruppe bertelsmann publishing group at the end of the s in  this company moved from gütersloh to munich key divisions remained in gütersloh for which a new office building was built in  at the groups official location to this day it has remained the bertelsmann headquarters referred to as the bertelsmann corporate center the rapid growth of bertelsmann led to structural and financial problems in the s financing requirements reached their peak from  to  for example the return on sales fell below one percent bertelsmann also encountered new regulatory rules in its home market in particular through laws governing mergers larger acquisitions became practically impossible at the same time there was an increasing saturation of the german market for the bertelsmann lesering whereas the foreign book clubs earned the lions share of revenues in this corporate division the internationalization of bertelsmann initiated in the s was taken further among other things bertelsmann acquired shares in the publishing houses plaza  janés based in barcelona and bantam books from new york city in the united states a location was established for ariola and arista records was acquired in the period of the – recession there was discussion concerning the succession of reinhard mohn in  he finally moved over to the supervisory board manfred fischer who had previously headed up management of gruner  jahr became the new chairman and chief executive officer with this move bertelsmann for the first time was led by a manager who was not a member of the owner family mark wössner became fischers successor as chairman and chief executive officer of bertelsmann in  the affair concerning the forged hitler diaries occurred at the beginning of his tenure which damaged the reputation of gruner  jahr and bertelsmann as a whole  to edit mark wössner brought the subsidiaries closer to headquarters in gütersloh in particular this involved business development and controlling under the leadership of mark wössner bertelsmann also took a stake in rtl plus the first private tv broadcaster in germany in  bertelsmann acquired a majority in rca records and merged its activities in the music market with the new bertelsmann music group sonopress a company established in  to manufacture records was not part of the bertelsmann music group rather it was assigned to the print and industrial division with doubleday another wellknown publishing house was acquired as a result the group ascended to become a wellknown international company and bertelsmann was temporarily the worlds largest media group in the financial year of  bertelsmann had over  employees and reached sales of  billion deutsche mark annually  involved business outside of germany and the united states was the most important foreign market after the german reunification and the end of the cold war bertelsmann also expanded to east germany as well as into central and

published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the

originally specialized in theological literature expanded its publications to include school and textbooks and in the s and s increasingly entered into the field of light fiction during the third reich the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable bertelsmann volksausgaben peoples editions in particular war adventure books such as werner von langsdorffs fliegerbuch on aviation were a commercial success heinrich mohn belonged to the patrons circle of the paramilitary schutzstaffel organization and sought to turn his company into a national socialist model enterprise during world war ii the c bertelsmann verlag became a leading supplier to the wehrmacht even surpassing the central publishing house of the nsdap franz eher especially in the years between  and  the revenues of the c bertelsmann verlag skyrocketed jewish slave laborers were not forced to work in gütersloh but in printing plants in lithuania with which the c bertelsmann verlag cooperated in  the reichsschrifttumskammer reich chamber of literature closed the publishing house to mobilize all powers for victory another essential reason for this was criminal paper racketeering by some publishers employees which led to a trial in   to edit after world war ii the company portrayed itself to the allied control authority as a christian publisher that was part of the resistance to nazism and allegedly persecuted ties to national socialist organizations were initially denied after it became known that erroneous or at least inadequate statements had been made heinrich mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house reinhard mohn one of his three sons took over the c bertelsmann verlag as hans heinrich mohn had been killed in the war and sigbert mohn was still a prisoner of war in

verlag under these conditions in  bertelsmann launched the lesering book club to stimulate sales the customers ordered books via subscription and in return received discounted prices the business increasingly shifted from the publishing house to the sale of books which was decisive to further growth in  the c bertelsmann verlag was restructured from that point on theological literature was

bertelsmann as one of the few nonjewish media companies shut down by the national socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the companys shutdown as a publisher of the resistance could not be proven historian volker ullrich proclaimed in the weekly die zeit that the notion of the companys being a resistance publisher was clearly baseless the files of the ihc have been publicly available in the company

receiving the vernon a walters award  in new york city thomas middelhoff portrayed bertelsmann as one of the few nonjewish media companies shut down by the national socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the companys shutdown as a publisher of the resistance could not be proven historian volker ullrich proclaimed in the weekly die zeit that the notion of the companys being a resistance publisher was clearly baseless the files of the ihc have been publicly available in the company archives of bertelsmann in gütersloh since  notes and referencesedit  bertelsmann erinnert sich neue westfälische in

originally specialized in theological literature expanded its publications to include school and textbooks and in the s and s increasingly entered into the field of light fiction during the third reich the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable bertelsmann volksausgaben peoples editions in particular war adventure books such as werner von langsdorffs fliegerbuch on aviation were a commercial success heinrich mohn belonged to the patrons circle of the paramilitary schutzstaffel organization and sought to turn his company into a national socialist model enterprise during world war ii the c bertelsmann verlag became a leading supplier to the wehrmacht even surpassing the central publishing house of the nsdap franz eher especially in the years between  and  the revenues of the c bertelsmann verlag skyrocketed jewish slave laborers were not forced to work in gütersloh but in printing plants in lithuania with which the c bertelsmann verlag cooperated in  the reichsschrifttumskammer reich chamber of literature closed the publishing house to mobilize all powers for victory another essential reason for this was criminal paper racketeering by some publishers employees which led to a trial in   to edit after world war ii the company portrayed itself to the allied control authority as a christian publisher that was part of the resistance to nazism and allegedly persecuted ties to national socialist organizations were initially denied after it became known that erroneous or at least inadequate statements had been made heinrich mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house reinhard mohn one of his three sons took over the c bertelsmann verlag as hans heinrich mohn had been killed in the war and sigbert mohn was still a prisoner of war in  the allies finally granted the company a publishing license after the currency reform in  there was a market slump in the book trade that also led to the next existential crisis for the c bertelsmann verlag under these conditions in  bertelsmann launched the lesering book club to stimulate sales the customers ordered books via subscription and in return received discounted prices the business increasingly shifted from the publishing house to the sale of books which was decisive to further growth in  the c bertelsmann verlag was restructured from that point on theological literature was

the company to go public this move was not ultimately implemented however today bertelsmann is a company active in capital markets issuing bonds for example since  the company has prepared its financial statements according to international financial reporting standards the new legal entity does not change any of the ownership of bertelsmann as early as the s and s the mohn family built up the bertelsmann stiftung which has owned the majority of shares in bertelsmann since  in addition to social responsibility tax considerations played a role in this moreover this strategy was intended

precipitated by a speech given by the chairman and chief executive officer thomas middelhoff on the occasion of his receiving the vernon a walters award  in new york city thomas middelhoff portrayed bertelsmann as one of the few nonjewish media companies shut down by the national socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature this interpretation was severely criticized for example by publicist hersch fischler the speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in  to the establishment of an independent historical commission ihc by the group this was headed by saul friedländer and additional members were norbert frei trutz rendtorff and reinhard wittmann the ihc presented an interim report in the year  and issued a final report in  it stated for example that the suggestion that the c bertelsmann verlag mounted resistance against national socialism was clearly not accurate the companys shutdown as a publisher of the resistance could not be proven historian volker ullrich proclaimed in the weekly die zeit that the notion of the companys being a resistance publisher was clearly baseless the files of the ihc have been publicly available in the company
