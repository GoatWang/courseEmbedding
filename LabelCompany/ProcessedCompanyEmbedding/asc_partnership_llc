way may the ambulatory surgery center industry stands at a crossroads with most areas of the country saturated with ascs net growth has stalled for the first time in recent history the acrosstheboard elimination of outofnetwork reimbursements has reduced profit margins at most ascs putting some facilities in peril and forcing others to take a hard look at their business strategies at the same time asc reimbursements during the past decade have declined by more than  percent as a percentage of hospital outpatient department reimbursements and the average percase reimbursement for independent ascs is  percent lower than that of a hospitalaffiliated asc given this challenging environment it’s easy to understand why there’s been a nearly  percent decrease in the number of independent ascs since  in many markets it’s simply too hard to turn a profit as a standalone facility to meet this changing landscape ascs increasingly are partnering with hospitals to optimize profit and secure sustained growth in our may  session at the becker’s hospital review th annual meeting i walked through many aspects of regent’s innovative approach to structuring hospital and physician joint ventures including the evolution of asc partnerships while fewer ascs are being built today hospitals and asc companies are acquiring existing ascs to create successful threeway partnerships in the past hospitals have had reservations regarding physician partnerships hospital leaders not only wanted majority ownership but also control of operations — frequently a nonstarter for physicians financial realities are forcing many hospitals to reconsider this demand the latest ownership and governance models typically allow physicians to maintain operational control of an asc while providing them a healthy financial result both in the case of a sale and on future earnings shrinking reimbursements too are forcing physicians to reconsider an asc partnership with a hospital the reasons are numerous  hospitalaffiliated ascs reap significantly higher payments for cases than independent facilities  strategic alliances with hospitals are consistent with the aims of healthcare reform models  these deals provide a hedge against shrinking practice reimbursements for surgeons and  joint venture ascs hold a competitive advantage over ascs that do not partner with hospitals hospital contracting model the hospital contracting model is emerging as the leading approach for structuring joint venture partnerships between physicians and hospitals by allowing the hospital to form a strategic alliance with select surgeons it minimizes the provider’s financial investment and helps achieve physician alignment goals if structured correctly payments per case using the hospital contracting model are at least  percent higher than an independent asc’s reimbursements this model also provides competitive protections for doctors and allows them to maintain daily clinical and operations control over the facility the governance structure of the hospital contracting model maximizes physician financial upside while also promoting hospital earnings in this model hospitals hold two board seats physicians hold four seats and a management company maintains one seat physicians are class a shareholders while hospitals and the management company are class b shareholders hospitals control class b and the majority vote and physicians retain voting control over clinical issues while the management company controls key legal and financial issues this model also provides hospitals with decisionmaking authority over budgets strategic decisions and disposition of assets while physicians manage the selection of anesthesia providers clinically related operating policies and procedures and approval of equipment purchases the hospital contracting model however is not recommended in every situation typically the hospital contracting model is successful when the doctors trust the local hospital in an oversaturated competitive asc market in a community where payors squeeze the independent ascs on price and outofnetwork facilities have to change to a contracted model in a market where the hospital of choice is accustomed to joint ventures with doctors where hospitals are interested in partnering with doctors in a market where the hospital has a strong track record of negotiating favorable contract rates and also has contracting power in an existing asc when the asc has matured andor does not see a significant increase in profits in the future and if the local surgeons can utilize this model to form a strategic alliance with the local hospital of choice the hopd model in situations where hospital contracting model is a poor fit the hopd model provides an alternative solution that allows for a comanagement agreement between hospitals and physicians in this model hospitals own  percent of the asc thus enabling hopd rates furthermore surgeons and management companies are united to provide operational and clinical oversight the hopd model provides an excellent opportunity to create a partnership in situations when a joint venture is unrealistic as with the hospital contracting model hopds can help achieve physician alignment and patient volume goals and be a successful part of a hospital’s overall business strategy for more information about
