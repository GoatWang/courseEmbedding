improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g

had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered

head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office

as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos

in  by bain  company partners mitt romney t coleman andrews iii and eric kriss after bill bain had offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end

company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by

applying consulting expertise to the companies it invested in became widely copied within the private equity industry university of chicago booth school of business economist steven kaplan said in  that the firm came up with a model that was very successful and very innovative and that now everybody uses in his  book the buyout of america how private equity is destroying jobs and killing the american economy josh kosman described bain capital as notorious for its failure to plow profits back into its businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other distributions the revenue potential of this strategy which may starve a company of capital was increased by a s court ruling that allowed companies to consider the entire fairmarket value of the company instead of only their hard assets in determining how much money was available to pay dividends in at least some instances companies acquired by bain borrowed money in order to increase their dividend payments ultimately leading to the collapse of what had been financially stable businesses investments galleryedit selected bain capital investments

offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in net income  employees and  stores bain capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment and romney sat on the staples board of directors for over a decade another very successful investment occurred in  when  million was invested in medical equipment maker calumet coach which eventually returned  million a few years later bain capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the gartner group which ended up returning a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed  companies with combined revenues of  billion in july  bain acquired ampad originally american pad  paper from mead corporation which had acquired the company in  mead which had been experiencing difficulties integrating

offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the

bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed  companies with combined

businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other distributions the revenue potential of this strategy which may starve

consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn

company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by

partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket

capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
