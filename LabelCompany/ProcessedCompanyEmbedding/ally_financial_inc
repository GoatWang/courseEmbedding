our beginnings in auto finance to our expansion into online banking credit and lending and wealth management our commitment to customers has been our focus for nearly a century s – s starting our engines helping auto dealers be successful the invention of the assembly line changed the way the auto industry did business to keep factories running smoothly manufacturers needed auto dealers to buy vehicles in large quantities in  we opened our doors as gmac a division of gm to help dealers finance and maintain their inventory and keep up with consumer demand making auto financing more accessible in the early s people looking to buy a car or truck had to pay cash or secure their own financing from banks that didn’t typically issue loans for automobiles we made it convenient for customers to get financing right at the dealership during the great depression car manufactures began segmenting vehicles by cost from lowprice to luxury models we introduced this pricing concept to the public with our slogan a car for every purse and purpose  opened our doors in new york city and later that year added offices in detroit chicago san francisco and toronto  financed our  millionth

wanted and the financing they needed at the same place in  we introduced buying cars on time with our time payment plan and gave over  million customers more options to finance a vehicle with a payment plan that fit their budget  financed locomotives during wwii  financed household appliances through participating retailers  introduced the time payment plan honolulu clipper   s – s ensuring peace of mind protecting vehicles inside and out as car manufacturers pushed innovation and style auto prices rose and insurance became an increasingly important part of our products and services

generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have seen  annual returns on average according to
