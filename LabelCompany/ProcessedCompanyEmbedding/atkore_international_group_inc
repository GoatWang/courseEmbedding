accounting principles in the united states gaap because not all companies calculate nongaap financial information identically or at all the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies further these measures should not be considered substitutes for the performance measures derived in accordance with gaap see nongaap reconciliations below in this press release for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures adjusted net sales we present adjusted net sales to facilitate comparisons of reported net sales from period to period within our mps segment in august  we announced plans to exit the fence and sprinkler product lines in order to realign our longterm strategic focus these product lines were exited during the first quarter of fiscal  management uses adjusted net sales to evaluate our ongoing business operations which no longer include fence and sprinkler we define adjusted net sales as reported net sales excluding net sales directly attributable to fence and sprinkler adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in evaluating the performance of our business and use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin allow us to readily view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance we define adjusted ebitda as net income before depreciation and amortization loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense net income tax expense restructuring and impairments stockbased compensation legal settlements consulting fees transaction costs other items and the impact from our fence and sprinkler exit prior to fiscal  net income was also adjusted to exclude net periodic pension benefit costs and the impact from antimicrobial coated sprinkler pipe or abf product liability these costs are no longer an adjustment to ebitda beginning in fiscal  due to the relevant insignificance and nature of the amounts prior fiscal years have not been restated for this change we believe adjusted ebitda when presented in conjunction with comparable gaap measures is useful for investors because management uses adjusted ebitda in evaluating the performance of our business we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of adjusted net sales net income margin we define net income margin as net income as a percentage of net sales adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share we use adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the company’s results that when reconciled to the corresponding gaap measure provide an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and or noncash items we define adjusted net income as net income before consulting fees loss on extinguishment of debt stockbased
