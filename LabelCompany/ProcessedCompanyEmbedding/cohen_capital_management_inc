ventures international business ventures our main line of business is constructing portfolios for our clients that will generate above average returns for our clients over a five to ten year period we do not focus on the short term movement of equity and debt securities but rather their longterm intrinsic value and whether or not we can purchase them at a significant discount to their intrinsic value the firm focuses its attention on midcap and largecap corporations trading in both the united states and abroad all of the firms’ investments are in multibillion dollar market capitalization companies with millions of shares traded daily and are all level one assets if an equity security andor level two assets if a debt security we do not have any holdings that are not valued daily on a major exchange and that do not trade with a lot of liquidity which gives us the ability to sell any security we own quickly should our clients require their capital we own all of the same securities for all of our clients we normally own between  securities at any given time we have found that concentration focus discipline and inactivity with ones capital is the friend of the investor whereas wall street is constantly focused on generating commissions on trading and hyper activity we are focused on finding value and allowing the management teams that we entrust capital to to build wealth for us and compound capital at above average rates of return every portfolio is constructed with a five year time horizon which allows our investment thesis to play out should one have an immediate need for his or her capital in the next  months our firm is not the home for their capital the firm’s investment committee allocates its investment ideas amongst all of its clients accounts under our
