statednow i would like to turn the call over to mikemichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director thanks mark and good afternoon everyone we have had a very business start to the year driven by early stage setup and deployment activities with new customers additional wins in the us and internationally and the continued rampup of our innovative gen solutionsq was a solid quarter for deployments we delivered more than  endpoints bringing our cumulative delivered endpoints to more than  million and we generated positive operating cash flow ending the period with  million of net cashread morebefore going through some of our key customer wins i would like to address our billings and profitability in the quarter as we expected the start of a number of new customer projects partly offset the anticipated decline from our top customer of  which is in the later stages of its multiyear deployment while our billings were within the guided range the profitability was lower than anticipated this was caused by a higher mix of projects with lowermargin hardware content combined with a delay in several highmargin projects which pushed billings and profitability from the first quarter into future periodsfinally our operating expenses were impacted by some onetime items and we have not yet benefited from our announced restructuringlooking out at the year we have good visibility for ongoing projects major new customer starts and our managed services and saas business this is offset by  factors first one of our suppliers had a factory fire in late april which could impact some of our shipments later in the year and second we have a somewhat lower expectation around future book and bill business for the yearwith this in mind we are adjusting our outlook for the year we now expect our full year  billings to be in the range of flat to up approximately  versus last year in addition we are accelerating the restructuring efforts which we disclosed earlier this year to better align our cost structure with our anticipated business levelsour top priority is to execute on our key growth initiatives in our core smart grid smart city and industrial iot markets this means a swift ramp of gen at our major new customer deployments and a sharpened focus on international opportunities leveraging our new geographic organizational structure where we are locating employees in the regions closer to our customers around the world at a lower costwe are also focused on innovation to bring the batterypowered milli  and new applications to our core smart utility and smart city markets and new verticalsi will now move on to some recent highlights around the quarter more than  of billings in the quarter were from projects which we consider new or which contributed little to no billings in the yearago period the largest was con edison which became our top billings customer in q and is moving forward with its multiyear deployment of more than  million electric and gas connections across its new york service territories we also had meaningful billings from earlystage programs at aep ohio pacificorp entergy and cesc of indiaoverall i am pleased with the performance of our teams and their ability to ramp these and other new customers as we work to convert our billiondollarplus backlog entering the year into largescale deployments in billingsnow on to our customer announcements and other developments first we are thrilled to announce that florida power  light company is further extending its smart grid investment with additional endpoints and expanded distribution automation fpl is a great customer with more than  million homes and businesses connected they continue to leverage the silver spring multiapplication platform for additional solutions including da advanced security and streetlights today we are happy to report bookings for  additional endpoints to support anticipated growth in fpls connected homes and businesses and a da expansion to further support fpls reliability goalsnext we have been awarded additional deployments in mexico from cfe as a followon to our  device award for mexico citys central region today we announced an award to connect approximately  additional ami devices in mexico citys southern district similar to our earlier award our technology will be integrated into cabinet subsystems provided by tecnologías eos a local partner in the regionwe are also formally announcing an award for approximately  ami devices in southeast mexico which we had mentioned on our earnings call for the second quarter of  these projects are expected to help improve revenue protection reliability and energy managementwe are also proud to announce that we have been selected by the golden valley electric association a cooperative in alaska to connect approximately  homes and businesses in its service territory gvea plans to deploy silver springs multiapplication ipv platform to support its ami program to its member owners and communities beginning this summer the deployment is intended to help modernize its grid infrastructure improve reliability increase operational efficiencies and enable its members to better manage their energy usewe also have another positive development for our smart city and iot platform we are excited to report that the city of chicago has selected silver spring networks as a technology subcontractor for the citys smart lighting modernization project this project demonstrates good traction from our recently announced smart city and iot reseller agreement with ameresco which is serving as the prime contractor for this project the chicago city council approved the project scope and funding a few weeks ago and we expect to contract with ameresco later this year the year project is believed to be the largest cityled wireless smart street light program in the us with more than  connected lights as part of the citys upgrade to led lightschicago intends to use silver springs network and data platform to remotely monitor and control the lights the city of chicago will own and operate the network supported by silver springs managed services and saas environmenti now want to say a few words about a significant milestone for us the upcoming introduction of our expanded developer program which we plan to roll out at the iot world  conference in santa clara next week we have significantly enhanced the tools and support for the developer community which we hope will accelerate the adoption of our iot technology for additional use cases in our core smart grid and smart city markets as well as new industrial verticalssome of the key enhancements include a new developer portal for improved access to our support a hardware developer kit for arduino to simplify the integration of the milli  into new devices the iot edge router dev addition which enables connectivity for additional devices to our platform and starfish studio a software simulator to speed application development we have already seen interest from our utility customers many of which are actively investigating other potential applications to further leverage their multiapplication iot communications platformto close i remain confident in silver springs potential for growth in the smart grid smart city and broader industrial iot opportunity we have a significant backlog with some of the most respected companies in the world and we will continue to focus on the gen rollout supporting largescale customer deployments we are investing in the new products and applications to further leverage our footprint of more than  million homes and businesses and drive growth in our managed services and saas business we are winning additional business with new awards in the us and international markets through our geographic sales organization and we remain committed to our mission to

leadership positions at cognizant and hewlettpackard earlier in her career she gained experience on wall street as an equity analyst and as a management consultant at mckinseywe are thrilled to welcome catriona to the silver spring team and have already begun to benefit from her presencecatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo thank you mike and good afternoon everyone its great to be here i also want to thank ken gianella for his contributions to the team and im happy that he is remaining as my senior vp of financebefore i dig into our first quarter results and outlook id like to provide you with some of my observations from my first  days as cfo here at silver spring networksi joined the company because of the tremendous opportunity and silver springs vision of leveraging its strong market position with leading utilities into international markets and new industrial verticals ive spent the first month getting to know my team members within the organization familiarizing myself with our technology learning about the primary business drivers and digging into our financial model silver spring has a strong pipeline of potential opportunities ahead including major new customers new products growth geographies and iot innovationthese strategic investments however can take time to pay off my first priorities have been to assess our outlook for  establish a plan to better align our expense structure to deliver the profitability and cash flow expected for a company of our size and drive a disciplined investment approach to support my key growth initiatives while staying within our expense envelopenow lets begin with the high level comments on the quarter gaap revenue was  million and in line with our expectations billings were  million down slightly from last year with the decline from our largest customer in  somewhat offset by a ramp of several newer customers total cost of billings was  million or  of billingsprofitability of our billings was impacted by  main factors first the product mix was skewed towards lowermargin hardware content in the quarter including managed appliances and back office equipment for the installation of new managed services and saas environmentssecond and the reason this was somewhat a surprise to us was that we saw some late quarter pushouts of professional services billings essentially we incurred the cost for these services during the quarter but the billings are delayed pending milestone achievement which we expect in future periodsas we look out to the rest of  and beyond there are clearly opportunities to improve the cost of billings particularly in achieving the scale and cost efficiencies on our gen and also in improving the utilization and ability to bill inperiod for our professional servicesfrom an operating perspective nongaap operating expense was  million this was higher than we had planned partially due to onetime marketing and ga expenses clearly as a company we need to be more efficient the executive team and i have been spending a lot of time scrutinizing our operating expense structure and executing on the restructuring that we announced on march  given the timing however there were few savings in q we are committed to getting the expense structure back on track and establishing a sustainable level of profitability going forwardnow on to the details from our first quarter results product billings including hardware and software were  million in the quarter down approximately  yearoveryear due to fewer endpoint deliveries from q of last year we delivered approximately  network endpoints in the quarter for a total of  million cumulative electric network endpoints product cost of billings was  million or  of product billings profitability versus the yearago period was impacted by a lower mix of nics and a higher mix of hardware appliances professional services billings were  million down  yearoveryear professional services cost of billings was  million or managed services and saas billings were  million up approximately  yearoveryear due to growth in our installed base and contribution from newer customers managed services and saas cost of billings were  million or advanced meter infrastructure billings were  million down approximately  yearoveryear due to a lower endpoint shipments versus a year ago we are pleased to see new solutions billings up  yearoveryear to  million this was driven by new distribution automation projects smart city and operations optimizer demonstrating success in deploying additional applications into our customer footprintfrom a geographic perspective international billings were approximately  of the total for the quarter or  million when we look at the pipeline and the projects coming in through  and beyond we see good traction in our apac and emea regions and expect to have more wins there over timeand a few housekeeping items gaap tax expense was approximately  and other income was approximately  basic share count was approximately  million shares net cash was  million at the end of the period down approximately  million from last quarter due to the timing of payments cash flow from operations was approximately  million capital expenditures were approximately  million and depreciation was approximately  million we feel very good about the pipeline of deployments and new customers that we see ahead of us in  and our focus on execution of the historical deals that we booked in  and in previous yearsas we look to the full year of  i want to highlight the  million plus in bookings that we closed in  as well as a strong pipeline of opportunities for the year ahead that said we also want to provide some flexibility to the year around the timing of billings and take into consideration the potential supply chain shortage resulting from the late april factory fire at one of our suppliers that could impact supply of our gas productany resulting lumpiness in our billings can have an impact on the linearity of our profitability this makes management of our operating expenses all the more important and why you will continue to see us sharpen our pencils on efficiencies before increasing our investmentsfor our second quarter of  we expect gaap revenue of approximately  million to  million billings of approximately  million to  million cost of billings of approximately  to  of billings nongaap operating expense of approximately  million to  million reflecting early benefits from our restructuring gaap tax and other expense of approximately  million and a basic and fully diluted share count of approximately  million and  million shares respectivelyfor the full year  we expect gaap revenue of approximately  million to  million this updated outlook reflects more flexibility for the timing of customer acceptances and the associated drawdown of their deferred revenue balances for the remainder of the year i also want to note that any one specific customer may have a significant impact on our gaap revenue for a given periodas mike mentioned we expect full year billings to be approximately flat to up  for the year our revised outlook factors in our q performance and our expectation of continued solid execution of our new customer starts into the second half of the year with a somewhat lower expectation around future book and bill business and shipments of gas products potentially impacted by the factory fire at one of our supplierswe expect cost of billings to be in the high s as a percentage of billings we expect to manage our nongaap operating expense to approximately  million to  million with the restructuring benefits increasing as we go throughout the year we expect gaap tax and other expense of approximately  million basic and fully diluted share count of approximately  million and  million shares respectively and we expect net capital expenditures of approximately  million to  millionwere putting the pieces in place for sustainable and profitable growth that will require making the tradeoffs so that our investments are prefunded by efficiencies i will be keenly managing our operating expenses and squeezing out inefficiencies across the company this level of discipline will allow us to invest in innovation around both our core and our higher growth iot markets that we can continue to win and shape the market in iotthank you and i will now turn the call over to mark for questionsmark mckechnie silver spring networks inc  vp of ir thanks catriona operator well take our first questionquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question today is coming from noah kaye from oppenheimernoah duke kaye oppenheimer  co inc research division  executive director and senior analyst catriona welcome aboardcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo thank you great to be herenoah duke kaye oppenheimer  co inc research division  executive director and senior analyst so first can we start with understanding the moving parts of lowering the revenue guidance in a little bit more detail i guess its about  million to  million lower at the midpoint maybe i dont have that right maybe its  million lower at the midpoint but i figured it’d be helpful to understand how much of that is bookings shipped versus this impact from the fire and maybe if you could explain why instead the book and ship business is trending lowercatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes sure sure so thanks noah good to meet you i wanted to start off by saying as we look at the full year we wanted to take our q performance into consideration and were feeling good about our expectations for how the new customer programs are going to ramp up over the course of the year but also i want to take a prudent approach to how were looking at billings over the course of the year and certainly putting fresh eyes on it theres some impact from the factory fire and i think we are looking to remedy that we are certainly looking at other suppliers that we already work with and just to make sure that we can satisfy the demands that we have in the market but were taking those  things into consideration and in terms of visibility we certainly have high visibility for the year in terms of deployments that are coming from our backlog this is both the ongoing billings and customers that weve had from last year as well as the new starts and it also takes into consideration the largest customer that we had last year comed was  of our billings in q a year ago and that is scaling down over the course of the year its now still a  customer but it is scaling down and weve largely replaced that with a number of other significant customers that are starting to ramping up over the course of the year we also have good visibility in terms of the primarily recurring revenue which is the managed services and the saas business we still expect that to grow double digits this year but we are again taking a look at the book and bill and we have a very good detailed view and process on how were managing that business one other thing to think about though too is as we look at the course of the year we benefited in the past from some nice significant software deals that come in and given the unpredictability of the timing of that im taking a more prudent approach in terms of how we model that into the yearnoah duke kaye oppenheimer  co inc research division  executive director and senior analyst okay so then maybe just a followup specifically on the book and ship this is for the whole team i mean are you seeing any specific reason why book and ship is trending a bit lower is there anything in the environment any kind of delays on spending decisions that you might attribute this tocatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo no id say theres actually no  no real change in the view id say certainly given what we saw in the last week of the quarter really the last week of q was that some of the things that we were expecting to actually bill in q got pushed out and so i see that happening and i want to make sure that i take that impact into consideration and these werent deals that we lost or these werent customers that went away they were literally billings that got pushed to later periods and i just want to be prudent about that kind of impact and were really just giving ourselves a little bit more flexibility on the timing of the billings for the year but in terms of the pipeline theres no change to the pipeline theres still a lot of  some specifically some international business that is looking intriguing over the course of the year and yes doing goodoperator your next question is coming from pavel molchanov from raymond jamespavel s molchanov raymond james  associates inc research division  energy analyst welcome to the team so let me ask kind of a classic cfo question your nearterm growth obviously a little bit on the low side but you have over  million of cash on the balance sheet and youve been building cash essentially every quarter whats the kind of the outlook for ma adding some assets particularly on the software side to kind of bulk up the nearterm organic growth picturemichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director its mike ill take that one yes we  i like having that war chest we are always  we are very opportunistic about that we are always looking for tuckins like we did with detectent and slv i would  i personally particularly like software where we can get more recurring revenue as opposed to more hardware revenue i like stuff thats both  that either we could sell through our existing customers or something that could accelerate us more into iot verticals so ill kind of leave it there we are certainly open to finding ways to increase our reoccurring revenue quickly by finding something that really meshes with what were doingpavel s molchanov raymond james  associates inc research division  energy analyst okay and youve given some color on kind of the pace at which comed is becoming a smaller component of the revenue mix can you also do that for your con ed the new york city contract i dont know maybe how much of that is expected to come in the second half of catriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo so yes so ill jump in here and mike might have additional comments but  so con ed is one of our newer customers and we expect to continue to see this ramp it was a greater than  customer in the quarter and i expect it to continue to ramp up over the course of the yearoperator our next question is coming from carter driscoll from fbrcarter william driscoll fbr capital markets  co research division  analyst could you talk about i mean  you mentioned ameresco is your partner in chicago they talked about other potential large smart city deployments in continental us could you comment on some of the activity there and your expectation of either working with them and then some of the cities its more of a straight lighting swap out but if it has intelligence if you could kind of compare and contrast maybe some of the larger opportunities youve seen in the us maybe near term or over the medium termmichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director well i mean yes so we have ameresco is a great partner of ours we have definitely instituted a channel strategy in terms of lighting we think lighting is a gigantic opportunity weve partnered with some of the biggest names in that space ameresco in europe we have evesa in urban controls that have also gotten us some good wins we think theres a large opportunity in lighting the nice thing for us is when you go into an area with lighting with our technology you get this lighting canopy and people are thrilled that it works as well as it works and then they realize it can be used everything else like metering and other smart city activities and environmental monitoring so its sort of a trojan horse for us its a great business it works really well the customers happy and it then gives them an iot canopy that they can use for other things so were actually seeing this great benefit where were seeing original ami customers who want to branch out and do things like lighting and were seeing lighting customers who once they get the lighting canopy in are thinking about doing other things with that  their canopy so were seeing customers approaching the use cases kind of from both ends of the spectrumcarter william driscoll fbr capital markets  co research division  analyst okay and then just as a followup any nearterm opportunities outside chicago of a similar type of magnitude that are on the radar screenmichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director i mean not that we could talk about to be honest with youoperator our next question is coming from alex kurtz from pacific crest securitiesdavid alexander kurtz pacific crest securities inc research division  senior research analyst enterprise infrastructure just going back to your guidance for the year for billings and thinking about the sequential growth rates as that relates to the backlog visibility can you talk about the confidence in sort of that q to q move thats going to be required to sort of get to the midpoint of your guidance and then my second question is just looking at consensus estimates for next year thats implying obviously before this call growth is there anything changed from a visibility perspective catriona that would make you think that might be more on the aggressive side based on some of the changes and professional service delays that youve seen and maybe we should be rethinking  billingscatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes so thanks alex for the question ill take the first question first which is about the sequential growth into the back half of the year the first half of this year is really about getting the significant customers up and running and were also looking into what that means in terms of the mix of products that we are shipping and certainly what we saw in q was that it was more of the lowermargin hardware to begin with we expect more of the better margin mix to be deployed in the latter half of the year so i feel good about the ramp the ramp of the billings coming into the second half in terms of  im really focused on  right now i think we have a  we do have a very strong pipeline for bookings and so i feel really good about our opportunity there but right now im focused on making sure that we deliver in  that we execute on the billings that we have in the plan and that we get some costs out of the business to improve the profitabilitydavid alexander kurtz pacific crest securities inc research division  senior research analyst enterprise infrastructure okay just trying to understand if growth is still an opportunity for  or if its too soon to knowcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo so i mean im giving you  guidance to be honest and i think we can talk about the outlook for  a little bit closer to the end of the yearoperator our next question is coming from matt robison from wunderlich securitiesunidentified analyst this is peter on for matt just wondering with the cfe customer in mexico what does your guys  what kind of ramp do you guys see with them and whats the time frame for thatcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo mexicomichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director yes mexico yes so what is the time frame for that so this would be the second  as you know the second one we had in mexico we are working on the deployment schedule as we speak it is in line  its factored into our numbers that we had planned on its on track i couldnt give you the exact time frame off the top of my head to be completely honest but its part of our normal course of businessunidentified analyst okay and then one other quick question have you guys  you mentioned a few projects that slipped from this quarter have you guys seen anything that was pulled forward or expedited during the quartercatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes so theres always some puts and takes at the end of the quarter theres always some moving parts some things that we are able to bill and some things that push out to the next quarter i think it was nothing unlike previous quarters so yesoperator our next question is coming from cindy motz from williams capital groupcynthia michelle motz the williams capital group lp research division  analyst just wanted to ask a followup on that last question  or one of the questions before about revenues so in the latter part of the year then we should see  or even the next quarter a bump from revenues from the delays that we saw first quarter is that correct and then  go oncatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes so yes so what we saw in q was largely the professional services being pushed out to subsequent periods some of those billings however will be in milestones that well see in q not in q just based on some timings associated with thatcynthia michelle motz the williams capital group lp research division  analyst okay but you do feel like  so you are going to need to see  even to make like lets say flat like or and the  you do feel comfortable that third quarter fourth quarter can ramp like  that would be like that rangecatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes yescynthia michelle motz the williams capital group lp research division  analyst and what about gross marginscatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes i think you  yes absolutely so just in terms of the back half of the year and the visibility yes weve taken a more prudent approach in terms of our expectations around the bookings that we are able to bill in the year and thats given essentially the timing of milestones and the timing of shipments but we do have good visibility into the back half of the year again we need to execute so thats a big focus and then in terms of the margins so we are kind of adjusting the way we are speaking about gross margin and its high s basically in terms of the cost of billings and i think the way to think about that is there could be software deals that were able to bill for and in past weve had good benefit on the cost of billings side when we ship a lot of software so im not assuming a lot of that essentially im trying to set a level that we can meet on a consistent basis in terms of the cost of billings and again if theres upside its due to a nice mix of the product that were shipping in the past again weve benefited from both software high nic content high analytics content and if we see any of those things then wed have a nice benefitcynthia michelle motz the williams capital group lp research division  analyst okay but you think its going to run around maybe  at the midrange like throughout the rest of the year the cost of billings orcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo its in the highs yesoperator our next question today is coming from david katter from bairddavid francis katter robert w baird  co incorporated research division  junior analyst i was hoping you can provide a little more color on restructuring initiatives i think if i heard correctly you announced accelerated restructuring or you talked about that when can we start to see benefits from that and what are some of the initiatives youre consideringcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes so absolutely thanks david certainly one of my key priorities and something im taking action on immediately is getting the cost structure right for our current business levels and the company had announced a restructuring back on march  some of the things included in that are realignment of our resources of our headcount theres some facility efficiencies in there and in terms of when youll start to see that weve already taken some steps so you should see some benefit from that in q so outside of direct employee cost we also have a large amount of contractorbased cost and those are some of the things that you can move faster on so we are looking at reducing our contractor cost and then were also looking at things like te thats another expense that you can adjust in the near term so this was taken into consideration in our guidance expectations for q in terms of opex so youll see us get a couple of million dollars out of the run rate in q and then we expect to see continued benefit from the restructuring as we go throughout the yeardavid francis katter robert w baird  co incorporated research division  junior analyst and maybe one more if  and then ill hop in queue i was hoping to dig in a little more on the margins and i know that youre being conservative for  but as we look into out years do you see software contributing to lower cost of billings over time or should we think about this as the new normalcatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yes so we didnt really speak about  im getting the fact that a lot of people want to talk about  theres lots of opportunity in terms of different deployments and getting customers up and running and shipments of the highermargin products as well as software so what im seeing is a number of new customer starts this year and those should have nice deployments on some of the networking equipment in the out years again well talk more about the outlook for  as we get a little bit closer but im feeling good about what im seeing in the business todaymichael a bell silver spring networks inc  ceo president and director id also just add that weve been pretty successful at selling up customers once we get the customers up and running weve been pretty successful at selling up some advance security software features and our operations optimizer software so theres certainly opportunity there to i think as weve been  as customers get  ramp to scale and get everything up and running and we show them the value weve been pretty successful in doing incremental addonscatriona m fallon silver spring networks inc  cfo yesoperator weve reached the end of our questionandanswer session lets turn the floor back over to mark
