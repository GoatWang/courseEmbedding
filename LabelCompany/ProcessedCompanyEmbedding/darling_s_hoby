touch media skullcandy technology at ces  frank radice spoke to hoby darling president  ceo of skullcandy for red touch media‘s interview series the future of content during the interview they discussed skullcandy’s crusher headphones and the company’s audio innovation efforts are you a skullcandy owner what innovations in audio do you think we’ll see being hyped at ces next year let us know your thoughts in the comments below frank radice hi this is frank radice and i’m here with hoby darling the head of skullcandy we’re continuing the series on the future of content hoby tell me a bit about skullcandy what you guys are up to and some of your new products hoby darling absolutely good question so number one when we think about skullcandy it’s always how do we bring innovative audio that’s fun and young and irreverent to our  year old consumer and from an innovation perspective probably the biggest thing we have going on right now is around these headphones that i have right now which are our crusher platform headphones and really what we did is we went out and we said hey  year old what is it when you think about how you’ve ever experienced music when did you love it most and pretty much what we always hear as you can guess is man it was when i sat in that front row of that concert that first concert i remember it and so what we did with crusher is we went let’s go and figure out how do we recreate that so instead of just being a studio environment let’s make it feel like you’re in that front row of that concert it’s gritty it’s dirty you can feel the vibration of the speakers rattling so that’s what crusher is all about frank so in terms of the rnd tell me a little bit about how you determined whether or not you wanted to have a product that tended to be on the bass side or a product that tended to be on the treble side how did you figure out that sort of paradime of sound was hoby sure i think overall when we think about sound we have what we call supreme sound so we really want to have a very smooth sound you now supreme sound across bass mids and highs but for this product it was more how can we bring a full experience around what you’d feel at a concert and what you feel at a concert is those bass sound waves and so you know this one isn’t necessarily tuned more bass it the haptic technology in it that makes your heart just boom boom boom boom like you’re in that front row frank are these active or passive earphones is there also some noise suppression or cancellation activity going on with them or is there some kind of a mixture of ambient sounds hoby yeah i mean you’ll have passive on it because of the way we develop the ear cup on it so you know it’s a full immersion experience but really concentrating on that really sound bass feel that comes out of it that makes your teeth rattle frank so you know your products are literally everywhere i mean you can’t go into almost a drug store or a high end audio facility and as a matter of fact one of the people from red touch media who works with us in south africa said the product is everywhere it’s ubiquitous it’s also at a price point that anyone can afford how did you decide that that was the business model that you wanted to have and talk a little bit about your international success hoby yeah so international on that i mean we look at the business we go we want international to be  of our business and i think for us bringing that american heritage piece to it around action sports around music but doing it at a price point that’s accessible you know that’s a big piece internationally when you look at the south africa’s as you brought up or latin america’s greater china but for us i think something that is special and you do strive for is how can we create amazing experiences and innovations but get them out to people you know so many companies create these amazing experiences but they’re priced so high that people don’t get to have them and we want to be able to take that fun take that irreverence and take that out to a lot of people so they can enjoy it frank thank you very much that’s hoby darling he is the head of

david eccles school of business featuring a keynote address by skullcandy ceo hoby darling breakout sessions and networking opportunities with area professionals here’s her report from the scene  the david eccles school of business hosted a career conference saturday for students in all majors other than finance and accounting the morning was filled with breakout sessions linkedin photographs and networking while lunch preceded keynote speaker hoby darling ceo of skullcandy and final additional networking with potential employers i was able to attend darling’s presentation and came away feeling both inspired and excited what makes hoby darling so successful yet relatable i will tell you besides his relaxed disposition darling’s work experience allows people to relate to him and realize that anything is possible if you work hard enough darling came from a small town in washington where at age  he sold concessions at a tennis club the experience as an employee at such a young age taught him something he would carry on throughout his entire life–the importance of taking risks darling emphasized that you can come from anywhere you just have to be willing to take a risk darling then went to college graduating with a degree in history that led him to law school at northwestern where he graduated in the top  of his class after spending some of his career in law darling learned his next lesson–you have to be passionate about what you do “put yourself in a position where you’re surrounded by people who want you to succeed” he noted darling soon found out that he was less than passionate about pursuing a lifestyle as a lawyer after practicing for more than  years he knew it was time for a change and quickly was given a corporate position at volcom while at volcom darling learned that competitors get better every single day and the importance of keeping up with those competitors in order to keep up you have to continuously improve to improve himself he pursued an mba at calberkeley after some time at volcom darling’s career path propelled him to nike where he learned how to truly be consumerobsessed he talked about the importance of knowing exactly what excites a customer and knowing just who it is you’re talking to you have to get close to your consumer and know what they do drive wear etc while working his dream job at nike darling was presented with an offer to be the next ceo of skullcandy hesitant at first darling went into the job focused that the company would run his way meaning consumerobsession was key he had no desire to optimize the company but rather in putting the consumer first as a result skullcandy’s stock price has seen a  increase in the time since he initially stepped in as ceo darling closed his presentation with some key take away points for students to remember take a risk–be innovative and challenge yourself get gritty–hard work persistence and resilience will always pay off be passionate–make work a calling better today than yesterday–always improve your competition always will be people matter–work in teams build relationships and care consumer first–the consumer always decides your product at the conclusion of his talk i was able to talk to a few students about their favorite takeaways from the entire conference blinc member scott thatcher stated that the breakout sessions were his favorite part saying “the small crowds made the environment easy to learn in i was able to network and learn how to get a job” hilal mohamed had similar thoughts stating that the breakout sessions were also rewarding “take risks and ride the biggest wave look for those new and upcoming companies” was the biggest piece of advice he took away from the conference share this story back to newsroom one
