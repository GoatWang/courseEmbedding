qualcomm promoted the other copresident cristiano amon as its executive vp while making renduchintalas departure official for the first time according to qualcomm the move wasnt a sudden departure at all in a statement sent to business insider  it said renduchintala was given a few months to consider his next move heres what qualcomm said a few months ago we made the decision to move away from a copresident leadership structure for qct   cristiano amon was the clear choice as president of the chipset business we made the decision to enhance the operation of qct by having a single decision maker who has an exceptional track record of executing and has the confidence of the team and our customers  we are confident in cristianos leadership as we capitalize on the opportunities ahead

last  years hes considered to be one of the biggest names in the industry having led qualcomms cdma technologies unit but qualcomm didnt have any mention of his work in yesterdays press release only
