syndrome aids caused by hiv is the leading cause of death in africa and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide this ipcavd is developing hivaids vaccines that use dma for priming and mva for boosting dnamva vaccine as well as a simpler and ultimately easier to deploy form of these vaccines the use of mva for both priming and boosting mvamva vaccine both the dma and mva vaccines use single vectors to express virus like particles vlp this ipcavd seeks to build gmcsf an adjuvant into these products for expression in cis in preclinical studies coexpression of gmcsf has substantially enhanced protection a central hypothesis for the ipcavd is that gmcsf improves protection by enhancing the mucosal presence of elicited t cell and ab responses clade c hiv which is endemic in southern africa and parts of asia accounts for about one half of the infections worldwide and  of the cases in india a country with a rapidly spreading infection that has surpassed south africa in its total number of cases the vaccine development effort of this ipcavd is focused on developing a clade c vaccine for india this manufacturing project has five specific aims  vaccine vector development  assessment of vaccine vectors for suitability for manufacture  cgmp contract manufacture and toxicology testing of vaccine vectors  regulatory support for an hvtn phase  trial  development and conduct of release and stability assays the project will be led by dr mark keister and codirected by dr harriet robinson construction of the needed mva vector will be by dr bernard moss under an
