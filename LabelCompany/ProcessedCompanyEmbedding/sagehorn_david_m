executive vice president and chief financial officer please turn to slide  and ill turn it over to you wilson wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thank you pat good morning everyone the positive momentum we generated in the first quarter continued in our second quarter as we reported adjusted earnings per share equal to the prior year quarter and better than we expected in addition we exited the quarter with backlog up compared to the prior year quarter in all four segments overall were pleased with our second quarter results and have a positive outlook let me expand on my positive outlook comment we have favorable market dynamics in our defense and fire  emergency segments opportunities to drive additional shareholder value through continued execution of our successful move strategy and ageing customer fleets that will need to be replaced we believe the current low replacement driven demand in north america in our access equipment segment will eventually turn positive and become a driver of new machine sales were also currently dealing with what we believe are atypical market dynamics in the commercial segment that we believe will revert back to more normal patterns in the future as we celebrate our th anniversary our team members are engaged and energized about our future the macroeconomic environment especially in the us and the sentiment of our customers are generally positive the tone of customers at both the american rental association show and conexpo was better than previous shows these factors also support our positive outlook as a result of our solid performance during the first half of the year and positive outlook for the remainder of  we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share estimate range from  to  to  to  ill let dave walk you through the details of the increase while i discuss each of our segments please turn to slide  for a discussion of our results and an update on our business the access equipment segment delivered another quarter of solid results while the dynamic of lower replacement demand in north america and challenging pricing continued in the quarter there is reason to be optimistic about this market construction data in the us remains generally positive and we believe rental customer sentiment continues to improve this was evident at both the rental show and conexpo there were a lot of customer comments at the shows about strong utilization rates improved used equipment values and the expectation for stabilizing or improving rental pricing booth traffic was strong at both shows as we showcased a number of new products market conditions in the quarter in other regions remained similar to what we have been seeing europe remains solid while australia and to a greater extent south america remain weak the asiapacific region continued to show growth driven by increased product adoption in china we are pleased that both orders and backlog were up in the quarter and we now expect  sales in this segment to be at the high end of our previous range we also made progress during the quarter on the restructuring plans we announced during our first quarter earnings call executing these plans will take time but we are on track as we simplify our manufacturing and parts distribution in both the us and europe initial work has begun including the recent opening of our new west coast parts distribution center but we dont expect to realize cost savings until  with the full run rate achieved in  dave will discuss the restructuring related charges we recorded in the quarter and expected savings in a few minutes please turn to slide  for a discussion of the defense segment the defense team remains focused on executing existing programs and pursuing additional opportunities im pleased with the solid execution and strong results this team delivered this quarter the jltv program remains an important platform for our defense team as we have discussed before we are still early in the low rate initial production phase of this program focused on supporting government testing and evaluation this program is scheduled to ramp up over the next several years and we expect it to become a significant revenue generator in our defense segment for a number of years we shipped a little more than  of our anticipated fullyear  matv deliveries to the middle east during the quarter and remain on track to deliver the bulk of the current order in the second half of the year we continue to engage in ongoing discussions for additional orders for matvs and other oshkosh products while we didnt book any international orders in the quarter we made progress and expect that we will secure additional orders we also continued to market the jltv internationally and expect to be able to begin nonus government sales in  or  work also continued in the quarter for the may submission deadline for the fmtv recompete contract you may recall from our last earnings call that the government shifted the submission deadline by about four months from january to early may we expect that there will be multiple bidders and we intend to submit a strong proposal incorporating enhancements to the vehicles that our government customer is looking for finally our defense team continues to closely monitor defense budget activity in washington as many of you know the us government is currently operating under a continuing resolution of course this is not new happening on eight occasions over the past decade none of our major programs were considered new starts so the impact to us in  is negligible essentially all of our second half  expected vehicle sales are in backlog so we do not believe the timing of signing the  defense budget will impact our  results we are hopeful congress will complete the fiscal year  appropriations process in the next few days at this time we expect the fiscal year  budget details to be delivered to congress in midmay which should give us greater visibility into what our defense customers intend to spend on oshkosh defense programs lets turn to slide  to discuss the fire  emergency segment progress on fire  emergencys journey to double digit operating income margins continued again this quarter with the segment reporting strong operating income margin growth our fire  emergency team has implemented a combination of initiatives to drive the margin improvements over the past several years a focus on simplification continuous improvement in pricing discipline have been big factors the fire  emergency team will continue to utilize these tools to drive continued margin improvement as we said previously we expect the us fire apparatus market to grow modestly in  due to fleet replacement initiatives along with the impact of continued construction growth and related increased property tax receipts but we still expect end of market volumes to remain below historical levels we experienced very strong orders in our second quarter some of which were likely related to the timing of a price increase at pierce as a result we exited the quarter with a record backlog in this segment well have a good chance to gauge market sentiment over the next few days at the fire department instructors conference or fdic show in indianapolis this the largest trade show in the us for fire departments it also offers oems a chance to show off their new products pierce will be unveiling several new configurations of the extremely successful foot ascendant aerial apparatus and our airport products group is launching its all new striker x airport rescue firefighting vehicle the most capable arff unit in the companys history were looking forward to seeing attendees reactions to these new products please turn to slide  and well talk about our commercial segment last quarter we talked about an atypical slowing of orders leading to reduced production and under absorption of costs in the commercial segment we took actions to lower our cost in response to the slowdown but the impact of these actions was not enough to offset the under absorption that we experienced this quarter as we worked through that lower demand the under absorption lowerthanexpected sales volume and onetime costs related to the january accident at our manufacturing facility all contributed to the weakerthanexpected and weaker than prior year performance on a positive note the individuals injured in the accident have all been released from the hospital and are continuing their recovery we also saw orders rebound in the quarter for both concrete mixers and especially refuse collection vehicles this order pattern is leading to an expected steep production ramp in the second half of the year while we cant say with  certainty it does appear that the order slowdown we experienced late in calendar  may have been a temporary event i mentioned conexpo at the beginning of this call this show is important for our commercial segment just like it is for our access equipment segment we had good booth traffic at the show introduced a number of new products customer sentiment was positive but we expect concrete mixer customers to remain cautious overall were glad to see the rebound in orders in the second quarter but were not pleased with the financial performance of this segment while weve seen a more extreme first half to second half demand and production dynamic this year we need to overcome the impact of that volatility were focusing on addressing these issues so we can deliver a bounce back in earnings in  that wraps it up for our four business segments im going to turn it over to dave to discuss our financials and updated outlook for  in greater detail david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thanks wilson and good morning everyone please turn to slide  were pleased to report second quarter adjusted results that exceeded our expectations and matched the prior years earnings per share consolidated net sales for the quarter were  billion up  from the second quarter  a  increase in defense segment sales led by jltv and matv sales increases more than offset singledigit percentage sales declines in the access equipment and commercial segments fire  emergency sales were down  so essentially flat with the prior year access equipment segment sales were down  better than our expected full year percentage sales decline for this segment commercial segment sales were down  with rcv sales down  as a result of the order weakness experienced in the first quarter as wilson noted we did however see a rebound in commercial segment orders in the second quarter consolidated adjusted operating income for the second quarter was  million or  of sales compared to  million or also  of sales in the prioryear quarter higher defense and fire  emergency segment results along with lower corporate expenses offset lower adjusted access equipment and commercial segment operating income commercial segment results included  million of costs related to the january accident adjusted access equipment segment and consolidated operating income for the second quarter  excludes  million of restructuringrelated costs recorded as part of a previously announced restructuring plan as a reminder we expect access equipment restructuring actions announced in january to deliver annualized cost reductions of  million to  million with partial year savings of  million to  million expected in  implementation costs to achieve these savings are expected to be  million to  million with approximately  million to be incurred in this fiscal year there were a number of drivers to the yearoveryear change in segment adjusted operating income in addition to changes in sales rather than call them all out i will point you to the appendix to the slide presentation on our website for a list of the drivers for each segment better than expected results for the quarter were driven by the defense and access equipment segments defense results benefited from sales timing and strongerthanexpected program execution access equipment results benefited from a stronger mix and the timing of discretionary spend adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was  equal to the prior year quarter adjusted tax rate was  and included discrete tax benefits of  million the tax rate in the prior year quarter was  which included discrete tax benefits of  million please turn to slide  for a review of our updated expectations for  as wilson noted earlier we are increasing our adjusted full year eps estimate range from  to  to a range of  to  the increase reflects the solid performance in the first half of the year and positive outlook for the remainder of the year and while we are only partially through the seasonally important spring and early summer time period which typically drives our businesses with exposure to the construction season in the northern hemisphere well perform we are encouraged by the strong backlogs in all of the segments as we exited our second quarter our updated  adjusted outlook includes the following consolidated changes from our prior outlook in addition to the adjusted earnings per share range change full year sales are now expected to be  billion to  billion compared to our previous expectation of  billion to  billion and adjusted operating income is now expected to be  million to  million up from our prior expectation of  million to  million at the segment level we now expect access equipment segment sales to be approximately  billion the highend of the previous range this represents an estimated  decline from  sales levels we are also increasing our adjusted operating income margin range for this segment from  to  to a range of  to  reflecting both the higher sales estimate and an expected more favorable mix were also slightly increasing our defense segment operating income margin estimate from  to  reflecting stronger program execution we are reducing the commercial segment operating income margin expectation from  to a range of  to  reflecting higher than previously expected inefficiencies related to a more pronounced production ramp in the first half to the second half of the year a less favorable mix and a more challenging price cost dynamic and we are now estimating that our corporate expenses will be approximately  million compared to the previous expectation of a range of  million to  million all other full year expectations remain unchanged ill conclude my section with a brief comment on our third quarter outlook we expect higher sales and adjusted earnings compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher defense and to a lesser extent fire  emergency sales we expect the higher sales in these segments to offset the impact of continued lower access equipment segment sales compared to the prior year and lower expected commercial segment margin ill turn it back over to wilson now for some closing remarks wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks dave before we get started on the qa id like to make a few comments weve talked about oshkosh being a different integrated global industrial i think youre seeing that today we have a unique blend of businesses with exposure to attractive end markets and we operate them as a cohesive integrated enterprise that said we know we have opportunities to capture and more work to do at this time ill turn it back over to pat to get the qa started patrick n davidson  oshkosh corp okay thanks wilson id like to remind everybody please limit your questions to one plus a followup after the followup we ask that you get back in queue if youd like to ask additional questions operator please begin the questionandanswer period of this call questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question is from tim thein with citigroup please go ahead timothy w thein  citigroup investment research great thank you good morning the first question was just on access and specifically on product mix as you look into the back half of the year i know in the last quarter you were expecting the year to be a little bit more favorable and im just curious how the order slotted through and specifically just as i look in the quarter you had well looks like aerials continued to grow as a percentage you also have that towing piece the jordan  i know there is couple of other odds and ends in there but thats kind of an abnormally high percentage of q sales so just kind of wrapping that altogether how do you think about product mix as we move into the back half of the year within access david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp good morning tim its dave overall i think we still continue to believe it will be positive and thats one of the main drivers why we did increase the margin for the full year we did see specifically as it relates to telehandlers you talked about those being down a little bit we did see a nice rebound in orders in the quarter for telehandlers but i still think on a full year basis we are going to see a more favorable mix than we saw last year timothy w thein  citigroup investment research okay got it and just on sticking with access the pricing i know youve called that out again in terms of the continued pricing challenges i guess but i noticed that was omitted in the q q in terms of quantifying the pricing impact im just curious if you maybe update us on that i know the comps are getting easier so that helps but maybe just update us in terms of the expectations on the pricing side for access thank you david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp sure i think i have to dial back a little bit and refresh myself on the first quarter a bit we certainly have been talking about pricing for a while now and i think the dynamics that we saw in the quarter were largely a continuation of what we really have seen for the past probably a year plus in the market as you know the markets have been down especially north america its going on its third year market overall and historically or typically what we would see is pricing generally swing more towards the favor of the rental companies i think as we see the market recover as replacement demand does pick back up i think our expectation anyway would be that we will see some improvement for pricing but as we look at our outlook for fiscal  that does reflect a continued weaker price environment on a fullyear basis compared to fiscal  timothy w thein  citigroup investment research i appreciate the time thank you david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thank you operator thank you the next question is from jamie cook of credit suisse please go ahead jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc hi good morning i guess a couple of questions one the backlog in the quarter for access was pretty strong i guess my question is as we think to – or can you just talk broadly i guess across product line within access how were thinking about lead times whether or not they are getting extended and how youre thinking about production in  are there opportunities to take production up and then second just a followup on tims question can you just give more color on the improvement you talked about in used and then if used continues to improve at what point would you expect new pricing to improve thanks wilson r jones  oshkosh corp jamie good morning ill start and dave you can add some color as we go here from a backlog standpoint at access the product lead times were in good shape today our sales and inventory operations planning process is robust and we adjust those production rates as we go i think what were going to learn a lot in the next couple of months may june to really understand how robust the market is going to be and stay or be in place going forward so we do adjust production levels by models as again the orders move and jlg access segment they are very nimble at moving those production lines so today were pretty well within all lead times of our customers expectations jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc so just to be clear is it like  days a couple of months and then again what does your guidance imply for production in  wilson r jones  oshkosh corp yeah those lead times vary by product line jamie so the higher volume the foot the foot awps kind of the center of the fairway if you will of access those are anywhere from six to eight weeks jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc okay wilson r jones  oshkosh corp as you get into the ultra booms will be a little longer lead time than that and then telehandlers are pretty well in line with what you would see our work platforms in that six to eight week timeframe jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc and then production for this year the assumption david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp so if you recall last year jamie we did a pretty significant reduction in inventory throughout the course of our fiscal  so our production levels were low as we came into the year we did talk about an expectation that we would benefit from a little better absorption in fiscal  and thats still the thinking jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc okay but just to be clear i just want to make sure im understanding the takeaway here so lead times seem pretty good right now i guess but if the order strength continued into your third quarter there could be opportunities to take production probably a further in particular on the bigger booms and stuff like that wilson r jones  oshkosh corp the answer to that question jamie is yes like i said theyre very nimble and can adjust those production levels and i do that evaluation through their weekly sales and inventory operations planning process jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc okay sorry and then last just a followup on the used pricing and then at what point would you expect to see the refuse continue to improve and ill get back in queue after that david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah we have seen better used pricing in the market i think youve heard some of the publicly traded rental companies comment similarly on that overall that certainly is a good sign because i think thats one of the components that the rental companies look at as theyre looking at fleet replacement andor fleet expansion but i think its really going to depend upon the timing and the cadence of the orders and the market pickup from the rental companies because that again back to historically what you would see is as the market for new equipment picks up its generally when you see a more favorable pricing environment for the oems jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc okay great thank you i appreciate the time ill get back in queue wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thanks jamie operator thank you the next question is from charley brady of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks good morning guys wilson r jones  oshkosh corp hi charley david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp good morning charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc just on the pricing theme switching over to maybe on the fire business can you remind us when that price increase went into effect and kind of within the second quarter what you think that the impact of not having that price increase in place the impact of margins on that david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp charley the pricing increase went into effect february  and given the backlog that we have in that segment we wont see the impact of that until our fiscal  charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so that pricing for the rest of the second half then were still under a pricing pressure from the bookings already in backlog then david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp i wouldnt say pricing pressure charley theyve been very disciplined in their pricing in fire  emergency in the last year two years now this is the third year in a row of a price increase and basically holding that price so backlog that they have in place is in good shape this is about going forward and the normal increase as we go yearoveryear charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah i guess what im trying to get to is because the mix of the airport stuff was down and that generally carries better margins and the margins in the quarter despite airport being down were still pretty good but youre also talking about pricing pressure so i guess im just trying to really tease out the operational efficiency gains that you guys have had on a run rate basis and kind of what that means to margins even farther down the road david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp actually charley we were pointing to pricing as being a positive to the quarter not a pressure wilson r jones  oshkosh corp yeah charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay sorry my mistake read that wrong let me switch gears at fmtv just a quick one on that recompete product is that going to be the governments technical data package as it was last time around or has that changed on where youre putting your own package in there david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp well this historically was a government technical data package as part of the contract we need to keep it up for any changes that have been made over the course of our number of years with the program the government will have the – as part of the recompete the government is looking to do some different things with the trucks so there is going to be some wilson r jones  oshkosh corp enhancements david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp enhancements to those thanks wilson and the government similar to the jltv program will have the right to procure the interest in those if the oems are interested in offering that to the government wilson r jones  oshkosh corp but that process was in the jltv is in this fmtv recompete so it was a technical data package charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay got it thanks david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thank you operator thank you the next question is from mig dobre of robert w baird please go ahead mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc yes good morning thanks for taking my question i just want to go back to access equipment the orders here were frankly better than what i expected and now that im looking halfway through fiscal  your combined orders were up something like  your backlog is in the best shape its been in couple of years and i guess im wondering from your perspective in terms of orders and backlog how are you tracking versus your initial expectations for fiscal  and i get it that it might be still a little bit early as to comment as to what customers are going to do going forward but im trying to get a sense here if things are indeed getting better or if its just sentiment wilson r jones  oshkosh corp mig i think things have improved i think as weve said before positive sentiment – much more positive sentiment in the market we said we did a little bit better than we expected and access is part of that explanation i think as i mentioned to jamie on her question weve said this several times its may and june that really are the kind of the proving months for us those are the heavy times and were looking forward to getting into those two months and were certainly planning on being a big part of the market during those two months and participating i think can improve thats good were certainly cheering for that but were also trying to be realistic and as you know this market can change very fast and we gauge the same question you do is it sentiment or is it really real action and we have seen better action but were not ready to say its full action i guess is the way i would describe it mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc all right then i guess my followup switching to the defense segment at your analyst day you talked about targeting  billion to  billion of sales as we look into call it fiscal  and  there are some moving pieces here im not sure that weve gotten any more clarity on the additional matv orders but knowing what you know today is that range still appropriate as we look at  and  wilson r jones  oshkosh corp yes it is mig today if you look at our backlog plus the adding in the fhtv contract that was not in our march  backlog were looking at a little over  billion in defense for  thats in backlog so we still feel comfortable at that  billion number and again as i mentioned in my prepared remarks were having some really good discussions internationally we havent booked any of those orders yet but we like our position there david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp what i would just – mig just to clarify on that in terms of the outlook the  billion to  billion i guess i would say that that range is still applicable and what we also said at the analyst day was while weve got a meaningful quantity of matvs this year we probably dont need to rely as heavily on those in the next few years wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thats a good point and also we sometimes just have the perception that just matv is international were also offering our product lines from a defense standpoint the heavies there is opportunities for those in the international community too mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc mediums right david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah mediums as well mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc all right thank you wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks mig operator thank you the next question is from jerry revich of goldman sachs please go ahead jerry revich  goldman sachs  co hi good morning everyone wilson r jones  oshkosh corp hi jerry david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp hi jerry jerry revich  goldman sachs  co wilson can you about within the fire  emergency industry has the consolidation over the past couple of years helped at all with competitive disciplines over the years its been tough for anyone not named pierce to earn a reasonable margin in that business and im wondering post the consolidation do you think the margin structure for the industry could start to improve wilson r jones  oshkosh corp well first of all thanks jerry i think that was a compliment to our pierce team so thank you for that when you talk about consolidation it really is meaningful consolidation has just started youve seen a couple of companies that have added to the – two or three companies that now are making in a little more significant in size so i think time will tell were certainly glad to see more companies consolidating especially publicly traded companies we think that will help drive better discipline from a pricing standpoint in the market but i think it a little early at this point as the two that have started some consolidation really are barely into it so well learn more as we go here but thats certainly something we hope we see is a little more responsible pricing in the marketplace david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp and jerry regardless of that as wilson said weve been on a cadence where were very focused on pricing discipline in our fire  emergency segment jerry revich  goldman sachs  co and in terms of – i appreciate that its early are you starting to see some positive signs on the bid activity because presumably thats started to play out to some extent wilson r jones  oshkosh corp jerry id say its early were evaluating that but theres nothing that i could say is a really positive trend at this point and again i think its just because its early and there is still – you know this is speculation on my part but my guess is there is still a lot of integration activities going on in these companies and i think again in the next year to  months i believe well be able to see – be able to evaluate a lot better jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay and lastly  david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp jerry we got fdic today you can pop down there and see whats going on so im sure a lot of activity jerry revich  goldman sachs  co sounds good and then in access equipment can you just talk about what youre seeing in terms of demand trends in europe and utilization rates there how does the recent cadence of activity in europe compare to what weve all seen in the us wilson r jones  oshkosh corp i would say its similar jerry europe continues to be as we described fairly solid and its normal pockets that you would think of the utilization rates are doing well i think theres still some pricing concerns around europe again i think it says that market is coming back and companies are starting to fleet up a little bit more that the pricing is – get a little more competitive in the rental space jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay thank you wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks jerry david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thanks jerry operator thank you the next question is from ann duignan of jpmorgan please go ahead unknown speaker good morning this is tom simmonich  on behalf of ann just a couple of followups on the earlier questions on access mix and pricing sorry if i missed it but how does the breakdown of second quarter sales compare to your expectations telehandlers and aerials and similarly can you give more color on the pricing environment in telehandlers compared to awp in the second quarter wilson r jones  oshkosh corp from a product standpoint id say the quarter played out largely as we expected we did make comment about telehandlers being down and especially in europe when we made the announcement previously that were going to be streamlining the telehandler product lineup we did expect to see some lower sales there and that played through in terms of pricing from the various product lines its something that we typically dont comment on again i guess what i would say is we did see a continuation of a challenging pricing environment that weve seen over the past year to yearandahalf in that segment unknown speaker okay thank you ill pass it on operator thank you the next question is from nicole deblase of deutsche bank please go ahead nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks good morning guys wilson r jones  oshkosh corp hi nicole patrick n davidson  oshkosh corp good morning nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc so my question is just around jltv i know you guys said that you shipped a little bit less than  of the international matvs in the quarter but im curious to know what the shipments looks like for jltvs and how the ramp looks in the third quarter and the fourth quarter david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp okay nicole you hit on both jltvs and matvs there so just to clarify which one are you interested in nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc so i know you gave matv on the call how much shipped in the quarter im interested in what jltv looks like david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp we did see a jltv ramp in the quarter but if you look on a fullyear basis from a revenue standpoint and weve got under the jltv program we have both vehicles as well as nonvehicle contractual deliverables under that and about  to  of our jltv revenues will come in the second half of the year nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thats helpful and then switching gears to commercial i understand some of the margin issues that you guys have been facing in the first half but i guess what does the progression look like in the second half of the year and whats your level of confidence that you will be able to ramp margins back up in the segment david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp sure the second half of the year as wilson commented on we are seeing or expecting a steeper ramp than we have seen in the prior years and then in terms of our ability to deliver our expectations for the – ill start with the third quarter the backlog is up yearoveryear so that certainly is a good sign and what its going to come down to really is just that throughput through the factories absorption needs to be better and it will be as we ramp up production here in the second half of the year and then mix we talked about the second quarter and the first half really being a weaker mix on refuse collection vehicles as we look at the second half of the year we expect based on what were seeing in the backlog a stronger mix of rcv so those two combined should help deliver the stronger margins that were expecting to see in the second half of the year nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc okay whats actually driving that step up in refuse backlog david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp well its really the – it goes back to the – we call it the air pocket of orders in the first quarter we talked about it on the last call when we saw some weakness in refuse orders in that first quarter weve heard everything from people were kind of taking a pause around the election to just timing of budgets wilson r jones  oshkosh corp calendar yearend david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp calendar yearend but where we did see some positive this quarter was that pickup in the order pace yearoveryear it was quite a bit stronger for refuse collection vehicles especially yearoveryear in the second quarter so i think it appears that a fair amount of this could be timing obviously well need to see the next quarter or two play out but thats kind of our thinking right now nicole deblase  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks ill pass it on wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks nicole operator thank you the next question is from mike shlisky of seaport global please go ahead michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc hey good morning guys i wanted to first david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp hi mike michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc hey i wanted to first touch on the fhtv announcement you had in last couple of weeks the contract that was announced i guess i was curious just want to confirm first that almost all of that is fiscal  revenue and maybe a small amount in fiscal  but also more importantly i was kind of looking at what could be margins beyond this business i mean i think youre going to delivering what is essentially brand new equipment thats been refurbished but is it more parts and service was there a higher margin business for you than the second average or is it lower margin business for you for that particular contract thanks david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp like in terms of the sales cadence you are right its largely fiscal  maybe a little spilling into  but i think i would say its fiscal  and then in terms of the margins on the fhtv programs specifically as you know thats something we dont go into what i would say is that does support our outlook that we talked about at the analyst day for the segment overall of highsingle digit margins for the next few years michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc okay and just also on the broader defense outlook here as well great guidance in the quarter and i think your guidance kind of implies that youll stay at that  maybe a little higher than that for the back half of the year is the uptick youve put in your guidance here is that kind of a permanent change to your efficiencies and cost structure i mean is it kind of relevant for fiscal  and fiscal  to kind of bump up our overall margins a bit just on your efficiencies or is this due to what youve currently got in your mix and your execution on these exact programs happening this year only david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah i think it certainly is a reflection of what we have in the backlog for  if you look at the first half of the year we delivered about  of that segment sales we got  in the second half so its really going to come down to execution in terms of how the team performs there were confident in the defense segment we got a great group of team members there but there is a fairly significant ramp up in the second half of the year we are benefiting as you know from a sizable matv orders as we think about the coming years as i mentioned earlier were probably not going to need to be quite as reliant on matvs to fill in in the coming years so i guess ill point you back to that highsingledigit margin for the segment for the next few years michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc okay great thanks guys david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thank you wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks mike operator thank you the next question is from david raso of evercore please go ahead david raso  evercore isi group hi thank you ill try to be quick here the actual sales guidance increase in access maybe i missed in all the commentary on it what actually drove the increase in the sales guide be it geographic or whatever may be david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp what we did david is tightened the range really and just took it up to approximately the high end of the range and i think thats a function of what we did see in the first half of the year in terms of sales as well as orders and where we are probably seeing better results or expectations on sales than we may have previously thought is really north america so that has been a positive and if you are going to think about a region of the world to have a little more positive outlook thats a great region of the world to see that david raso  evercore isi group and within that a little more aerial maybe of size versus teles because you bumped up officially the numbers are you bumped up the revenue  million with  million higher ebit so its like a  incremental margin boost in the guide is it also a positive mix in north america david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yes wilson r jones  oshkosh corp yeah david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah a positive mix overall but certainly in north america as well david raso  evercore isi group and again maybe i missed this i apologize the savings on the restructuring in access can you lay out again the timing of those not the cost of savings david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp sure call it  million to  million in fiscal  and then we get to the full run rate in fiscal  david raso  evercore isi group okay great and second you made the comment less reliance on matvs going forward but as you know one of the anxieties around the stock is the dollar of this years earnings are the matv right so next year if no new orders come in you only have about a  left to ship next year so youre kind of from  to  lets call it on matv so to makeup that  and i appreciate you dont want to give the fhtv margins on the new contract but can you help us maybe allay some concerns about how do i make up for that matv yearoveryear decline of say call it  if i dont get any more matv orders david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah well were not going to go into a lot of detail at this time david ill keep going back to what we said at the analyst day and we still feel i think very comfortable with that that we believe this segment can deliver call it high singledigit operating income margins for the next few years the  through  time period that weve talked about at the analyst day theres a lot of moving pieces and its not all just matv david raso  evercore isi group and to that end is there an update on the matv negotiations or potential new orders that you can provide for us wilson r jones  oshkosh corp what we said david is we have not booked any new orders and its more than matvs in the international community theres other mediums and heavies that are in play here but we like our position weve had good discussions going forward and we believe were in good shape but just havent booked those orders yet david raso  evercore isi group okay i appreciate it thank you very much wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks david david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thanks operator thank you the next question is from steve barger of keybanc please go ahead ken h newman  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning guys ken newman on for steve david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp hi ken ken h newman  keybanc capital markets inc first question is on defense margins it does look like youre implying flat margins in the second half versus pretty strong margins in the second quarter but with matvs ramping shouldnt mix be getting better just curious if you can square that with your guidance wilson r jones  oshkosh corp sure as i said i think on one of the earlier questions we still have about  of the sales to secure or deliver in the second half of the year and its really going to come down to execution so we have brought on a fair number of new employees as weve gone through the first two quarters of the year here part of that is to help the ramp up of jltv part of that is to deliver the matv order so ill go back and say its not again all just matvs we are seeing a meaningful ramp in the jltv program as well and if you think about the second half of the year were probably going to have a little lower absorption than in the first half because we were quite busy in this first half building matvs to sell in the second half of the year but if the team executes there is an opportunity to do a little bit better than were probably guiding to for the year ken h newman  keybanc capital markets inc understood and then i wanted to go back to i think a previous question that was asked but ill ask it in a different way second half access sales are implied to be down call it  or  but backlog in the quarter was up  yearoveryear and youd mentioned that lead times seem pretty flexible so can you again just help me square the math there in terms of how we should be thinking about the guidance versus the strong backlog number this quarter wilson r jones  oshkosh corp well we have had a great backlog we said we performed a little bit better than we expected in the first half it goes back a little bit to what dave was talking on defense on execution weve said it many times may and june really determine where access will finish and if may and june are stronger then that should lead us to a better finish at access but we want to be patient we want to work through that the access team is on point and working the market very well and again were certainly cheering that they achieve that but today were going out with the guidance as we see it and we dont want to get ahead of ourselves ken h newman  keybanc capital markets inc all right and then i guess a followup to that i mean with awp decremental margins at  in the quarter can you just explain why you have the confidence that second half sees margin growth despite maybe some conservatism on the sales side wilson r jones  oshkosh corp i guess i would caution you a little bit from looking at just a quarter decrementals if you look at the first half as an example i think the first half decrementals are  so significantly better than what youre seeing in the second quarter couple of things driving the second quarter decrementals one is incentive compensation so taking up the outlook for the fiscal year in that segment we actually had a little bit of a catchup from the incentive compensation that we recorded in the first quarter and if you dial back to last year we were going the other way so that kind of magnifies the impact of the incentive compensation adjustment in addition with conexpo this year we did have some higher trade show costs the other item i would add is looking at the second half of the fiscal year volumes certainly do pickup just from a seasonality standpoint so well benefit there from an absorption standpoint as well so overall i would say we do feel good about the margin expectations for that segment ken h newman  keybanc capital markets inc perfect thanks wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thank you operator thank you the next question is from seth weber of rbc capital markets please go ahead seth weber  rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys wilson r jones  oshkosh corp hey seth seth weber  rbc capital markets llc i wanted to go back to charleys question on fire  emergency it looks like second half revenue should be up yearoveryear but pretty modest margin improvement for the segment on a yearoveryear basis something like a midteen incremental margin i mean is there some conservatism based in your  margin outlook for fire  emergency for this year given what youve been talking about with better pricing yearoveryear and what not david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp seth i guess a couple of things would come to mind one is we do have some international orders that probably had a little bit of a different margin dynamic than we typically would expect and well need to work through that here in the second half of the year thats probably the big one and then we were already making progress last year so i think just ill call it the comps maybe start to get a little tougher in terms of the leap and improvement that were making but i dont want to get the focus off of the improvement that the segment is making overall theyve had some very nice margin improvements in the last few years and were confident that they are on the path that they need to be to hit that doubledigit margin in the future seth weber  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks dave and then i guess just a bigger picture i know its early days on the jltv but conceptually can you help us maybe think about how much experience with the program do you need to at some point go back and revisit your margin targets your internal margin targets david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp sure seth weber  rbc capital markets llc i mean is that eight quarter event im just trying to handicap how much experience you really need on that david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp yeah i think as we sit here today we look at it every quarter were required to do that from a gaap standpoint but i dont think weve seen enough yet to make any moves and if i had to put a date on it i would say probably late in fiscal  we probably would be the time when we may have enough experience under our belt to have some confidence to make a move if we felt necessary seth weber  rbc capital markets llc perfect thats very helpful thanks guys wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thank you david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp thanks seth operator thank you the next question is from ross gilardi of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning guys thanks for fitting me in wilson r jones  oshkosh corp hey ross ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch i just want to ask just back on access in the competitive environment clearly there has been some other competitors really more active well one or the other in particular over the last year and clearly were getting a lot of questions on jcb and what theyre up to and the national rental companies and so forth but i just wanted to get your general view on your ability to sustain market share over the next several years in this market and perhaps a slightly more crowded space and we get that pickup in replacement demand in  and its more modest kind of maybe in the singledigit range how comfortable are you that you can still grow with that type of trajectory wilson r jones  oshkosh corp well ill talk about the competitive environment a little bit ross and then dave if you want to talk about the growth environment on the margin side we have seen more entrants come in ross that youre very familiar with i would say that we believe if we keep doing but what we do best at jlg and thats really the customer experience our online express with that electronic connection with our customers and then performing with quality products on time helping them to do the important things they need to do in their business we believe will keep us in a good position again its always about continuous improvement and executing to please those customers but theres going to be a lot of pressure on supporting products in the marketplace especially if it ticks up and some growth and replacement goes in we believe that helps to sustain the competitive advantages because of our service footprint our parts support and again those relationships that we built over many years at jlg david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp and ross in terms of an outlook i think you described it as a flattish market next year is that ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch slight growth dave just kind of like ish percentage just a hypothetical number but a ish percentage type growth here next year if you got a modest bump in replacement demand do you get your fair share how confident are you that you can kind of sustain market share with more competitors in the david m sagehorn  oshkosh corp i believe we do get our fair share the team at access there is a lot of pride there is a lot of competitiveness there and they are ready for the challenge i guess i would say and im sure they would say bring it on but were not going to get into specifics around  were going to have to see how things play out here but overall yes we do believe we would hold our fair share ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch okay just lastly steel is there anything you could say on that did you see more pressure come through in q do you feel any more kind of comfortable with the second half outlook relative to how you felt three months ago or any commentary would be helpful steven c mizell  oshkosh corp yeah we saw it continue to move up a little bit through the quarter i think you read various views on where its headed i think our expectation for now is that it may not increase a lot through the remainder of this fiscal year but its probably not going to come down a lot either and as we get another quarter down the road here well have an assessment of whether we think its going to start to drift back down in  i think there were some expectations that were going to start to see it drift back down in the summer maybe later summer but i think it seems like that maybe pushing out a little bit ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks very much steven c mizell  oshkosh corp thank you wilson r jones  oshkosh corp thanks ross operator thank you at this point id like to turn the conference back over to
