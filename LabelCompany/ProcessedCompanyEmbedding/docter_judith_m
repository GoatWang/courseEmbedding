diagnoses and prescribed me a medication that i later found out was completely inappropriate for my condition she is nice but that does not mean she is a good doctor do real research before choosing a doctor read the negative reviews  they often have a lot more to say than the positive ones was this rating useful  flag  submitted august   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei would only recommend dr kemps office to someone that i didnt like very much she makes off the cuff diagnosis that arent correct once the rather expensive bloodwork comes back from the lab and she has horrible followthrough there was a very costly billingcoding error on my bill that basically took an act of god and man to correct and several of my completely unnecessary blood tests werent covered due to the fact that they arent considered customary my two visits with her were basically just a huge waste of my time and money i will keep looking for a new gp and so should youwas this rating useful  flag  submitted august   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgeive had this doctor for almost two years now simply put shes amazing more than any other doctor ive had in the past she spends time to ensure that shes answered all of your questions she explains what medications do that she is recommending and she explains various options that can be pursued her practice is warm and inviting and doesnt have the usual cold utilitarian feel of a doctors office her staff is extremely helpful and they go out of their way to ensure that you as a patient stay well informed for example theyve actually called me in the past to tell me that they received a request from the pharmacy for a refill and that they responded authorizing the refill shes a great doctor and has a great practicewas this rating

months every month she fills my medication which ive been on for  years and need in order to function shes usually on time but in the past she has missed the date and left me without for a day or two this last time she left me without for  days the doctor she had on call refused to fill the prescription because he couldnt verify that dr kemp had prescribed it for me by the time she returned i had experienced the full set of withdrawals and had missed a good deal of work then i got a letter in the mail from dr kemp informing me that she was terminating me as a patient after several calls to inquire why she said i was rude to her staff disregarding the fact that i was in pain from the withdrawal she decided to drop me because i was not polite i have filed a complaint against dr judith
