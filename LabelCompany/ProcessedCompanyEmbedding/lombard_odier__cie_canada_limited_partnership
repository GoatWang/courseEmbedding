environment of improving growth and stable inflation  leads us to maintain our riskon investment stance now that political concerns have abated investor focus is shifting back to fundamentals the particularly improved picture in the eurozone warrants continued preference for european equities the corollary is that an inflexion point in ecb nonconventional monetary measures lies ahead quite probably the main game changer of coming quarters we have thus begun to position portfolios for euro appreciation the impact of a tighter ecb stance on european bond markets will need to be closely

the same cannot be said about brazilian politics quarterly investment strategy   japan  as good as it gets japan’s cyclical conditions remains solid with growing domestic consumption and investment – and even incipient signs of wage inflation in some segments of the labour market the monetary policy framework unfortunately ties the economic outlook largely to external factors such as crude oil

perspectives hide archive  how will brexit shape britain’s relationship with the continent does brexit really signal the end for globalisation by john arlidge wednesday  september  contact us the world changed forever on  june  when the british public voted to leave the european union eu after more than  years the immediate fallout was extreme global stock markets tumbled while the pound plummeted to a year low much of this initial reaction has since been reversed with european stock markets including the ftse  rebounding to prereferendum levels but with years of exit negotiations ahead the brexit effect is far from over following are just two views on what is an extraordinarily multifaceted subject the picture may still be developing but it’s already time to “rethink brexit” brexit globalisation the uk’s historic vote to leave the european union opened debate in all parts of the world on the cracks in the philosophy of a european community what impact does brexit still to have on our markets globalisation is good or rather it used to be britain’s “brexit” vote to leave the european union is making many rethink the liberal economic order many britons voted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc in protest at the free movement of people and money that they blame for impoverishing them and making it harder for them to find school places for their children and hospital appointments for their family their action has encouraged others most notably in europe and the us where antipathy towards globalisation crosses the political spectrum as isolationist sentiment grows its impact is beginning to be felt in the markets one of the reasons why sterling fell in value by around  after the brexit vote in june is that investors believe britain will be a less competitive economy outside the integrated eu economy and the eurozone beyond europe figures from the world trade organisation wto show that export growth among developing countries fell to a meagre  in   a precipitous decline from more than  in  in july  the imf slashed its forecast for global trade growth for the umpteenth time this year will be the sixth year in a row that world trade has been flat or falling as a share of the global economy  after decades when trade was rising faster than the world economy and the engine of prosperity for emerging market economies small wonder that many are now calling time on an economic order that has endured since the latter half of the last century martin wolf now questions whether capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible the good news for those who believe that free global trade is a longterm net win for trading partners and for global prosperity is that while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world others are forging ahead while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world others are forging ahead wto figures show that while overall export growth among developing countries may be slowing trade between developing nations is rising sharply some  of developing countries’ exports went to other emerging economies in  up from   years ago trade between china and india was bn in  by  it had reached bn india’s total trade with africa grew more than  in only four years to almost bn in  chinese companies invested bn around the world in   more than ten times the amount in  figures from the american enterprise institute show the total that indian companies have invested abroad  bn in   has risen  in the past five years what’s more there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade french  yes french  economy minister emmanuel macron has resigned from the government the yearold former investment banker is expected to run for the presidency under a prointegration pro open markets banner polls in france show also support for eu rising since brexit vote in the spanish general election that took place just after the brexit referendum support for the mainstream centre right rose while the radical fringe lost support there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade perhaps the shock of brexit has given the supporters of globalisation just the jolt they needed it is some  small  comfort for “bremain” supporters if their loss turns out to be globalisations gain  samy chaar on brexit by jessica bown wednesday  september  lombard odier’s chief economist samy chaar believes the shortterm impact of the brexit vote on global stock markets has already been erased but that the ongoing uncertainty is a serious risk what impact has the result of the european union eu referendum had on european stock markets what impact has the result of the european union eu referendum had on european stock markets global markets all went down on the morning after the vote however if you look at any european index now they are all trading back at above june levels in other words the effect has been completely erased what impact do you expect it to have longer term europe currently provides  of foreign investment into the uk so brexit could be a real game changer for the uk economy european markets may also be affected if other eu countries vote to leave the union but this seems unlikely at this stage does brexit threaten london’s status as a financial hub the short answer is yes of the  major banks in the city more than two thirds are foreign and a big chunk are there to operate in europe however cities such as paris and frankfurt are not ready to replace london as europe’s main financial hub so it is not the end of the city as we know it do you believe brexit will have political ramifications elsewhere in the world internationally antiestablishment sentiment is pushing people towards political extremes but while there is exasperation with the eu in other european countries these countries have stronger ties to the union not least because they have the euro even in italy there is little appetite to return to the lira what do you expect to happen to uk interest rates short term i do not expect uk interest rates to change however sterling has taken a hit and the uk has very little manufacturing the higher cost of imports will therefore drive inflation creating another problem for the bank of england what effect will brexit have on real estate in the uk lower interest rates are good news for property investors – and the depreciation of the pound acts as a cushion but the prime london property market is dependent on investment from europe russia and the middle east so there is vulnerability especially as these properties are so overvalued what are the biggest risks facing investors during the exit negotiations uncertainty is the undoubtedly the biggest issue for investors at this time it’s going to be a long process and for the uk a lot depends on the economic model put forward by theresa may we should have a better idea of what she is planning after the autumn statement on  november  what can investors do to protect themselves against the risks linked to brexit investors should think on a global scale and seek exposure to countries that will not be impacted by this issue emerging markets are one example of this they are volatile but could provide a  yield our view is to have a wellbalanced portfolio that preserves your capital and gives you a little something on top what investment opportunities may arise from brexit one possibility is that as the balance of power in europe shifts the eurozone – rather than the eu which is bigger and less flexible – will wield greater international power previous next read more on

is a new status quo in the world of power and ambition millennial entrepreneurs lead the charge in innovation and investment and there are more millionaires under the age of  than ever before but as bedrooms become boardrooms and university assignments become the next tech startups how will this new generation change the face of wealth the millennial generation the millennial generation is defined by entrepreneurship more than anything else and with more millionaires under the age of  than ever before they are changing the face of wealth and investing millennials are not only creating disruptive technologies they’re expecting the same thinking applied from the companies they do business with innovation seamless ease of use and transparency are now key components of the value chain that’s good news for the rest of us as it’s forcing traditional companies across multiple sectors to adapt or be surpassed technology and attitudes about wealth are just two of the things that separate today’s young entrepreneurs from other generations these freshfaced founders grew up customising their own nikes even xbox controllers were produced by their own design it’s no wonder tailored services are now expected rather than seen as an extra and when they see a gap in the market they set up their own companies to address those needs take year old londoner daniel attia he didn’t think estate agents were earning their  on average fees so he cofounded yopacouk an online home buying and selling service with a simple stratified fee structure the site launched last year and is creating a buzz in the uk’s billionpound property business attia and his business partners together have decades of experience in the property market they’ve seen how it works from the inside but are young and hungry enough to follow their instinct which is that there’s a better more democratic way to do business crucially they also know that if they don’t disrupt traditional heavily feebased industries someone else will “this is the last real archaic industry that we could see that really hasn’t been touched for so many years it was just waiting for someone to come and really change it and disrupt it” attia says clients choose from three different fee tiers with total transparency for entrepreneurs like attia that transparency and strong customer service are the cornerstones of any new business these days his office responds to calls and emails seven days a week “eventually we want a member of our team to be in the office  hours every day” the benefits of an increasing push from millennial entrepreneurs to deliver on service convenience and price is creating a positive impact across all sectors there’s a sense that the something tech founders know more about almost everything than any other generation but the irony about these young entrepreneurs making their first millions is that their attitudes towards wealth and investing are totally different from those of their parents and other generations adults born after  grew up in a recession which understandably helped shape a fairly conservative view towards investing in the stock market it also created a sensitivity to market volatility although millennials have less financial knowledge than their parents they have a faster route to wealth not just from their own successful startups but also through inheritance more millennial millionaires have inherited wealth than any other generation according to a study published earlier this year that found that  percent of millennials aged  had affluent parents compared with just  percent of genx millionaires and  percent of baby boomer millionaires the fiscal safety net has helped drive entrepreneurship among millennials but is also pushing changes in the way financial advisors interact with customers one california public relations director recently lamented about new client meetings with young tech founders typically an hour is scheduled yet young entrepreneurs are insisting on meetings of no more than  minutes millennials are changing the rules – replacing long fancy lunches for short meetings over coffee financial advisors are honing their threeminute elevator pitch rather than poring over pages of documents to prove the value of an investment young entrepreneurs are insisting on meetings of no more than  minutes by extension young entrepreneurs want to be talked to in clear straightforward terms not for them opaque fee structures wrapped up in complicated jargon because of startups like yopa and antlos which allows the nonelite to charter boats and yachts airbnbstyle with upfront pricing fees without the cloaked mystery are becoming the norm whether it’s renting a yacht or making an investment a report on millennial wealth management by deloitte suggests performancebased fees rather than flat fees this is a generation that has taken investment clubs to the next level entire online communities connect investors around the world to share ideas and strategies millennials are the generation that made cutthroat a bad word and collaboration paramount their willingness to embrace radical transparency and disclose their holdings to members of their community online or otherwise is no different entrepreneur jon medved not a millennial founded ourcrowd to democratise venture capital with a minimum net worth of usd m anyone can invest alongside billionaires and venture capital gurus the price of entry is just usd  and ourcrowd investors include andreessen horowitz sequoia ge and others millennials are the generation that made cutthroat a bad word and collaboration paramount the opportunity to get in on an uber or google before the share price skyrockets is one benefit of sites like ourcrowd facebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife who pledged  of their shares in the social media site with a value of usd b to charitable causes represent their generation other millennials may not have the resources to give away a billion dollars a year for the next three years the way zuckerberg can but the commitment to philanthropy and social causes is an important factor for these new millionaires when deciding where to put their money for this generation money is not the sole indicator of success nor do material goods provide the instant gratification they seek it’s quality of life that matters most seventy percent of america’s  university graduates are more concerned with office culture than compensation nearly all of them believe it’s important to work for a socially responsible company and value personal and professional growth over a higher income that could explain why in the city of chicago alone the number of mbas taking jobs at technology firms rather than finance has risen from  to more than  since  further proof resides in silicon valley stock options and more zeros on their annual salaries aren’t the things that tempt hotshot developers to switch companies it’s the flexible work hours a positive environment and convenient amenities that have the real value the ability to work remotely fulltime or even for a few months a year along with authenticity – a brand that’s true to its customer and its employees are like gold dust they apply the same expectations of an employer to the companies they work with or patronise which means that we’re only going to see more brand partnerships be it a social cause creative or tech there is a sense of obligation to create positive change in the world which makes alternative or impact investments attractive to  percent of millenials the desire to play an active role in the world isn’t limited to business it affects their decisions across all aspects of their lives how and where to travel and which experiences to seek there is a sense of obligation to create positive change in the world which makes alternative or impact investments attractive to  of millenials it’s never been more important for financial services and other companies to either adapt to suit these new customers or partner with businesses who can fill the gaps the emerging affluent are now those with investable assets of usd   and an annual income of  the face of wealth is changing and millionaire millennial entrepreneurs are here to stay after all young founders may start small but when they work out the secret to a successful

are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

varietals wineries wine growing regions across the wine world different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine the distinction between old world wine regions and new world wine regions is particularly important as a sweeping generalization old world regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven while new world regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity for example cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in france will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors while cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in california will likely produce wines that are more fruitforward but different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes for example within france bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc grapes while burgundy is associated with red wines made from the pinot noir
