autonomous by the divestiture of the semiconductor products sector of motorola in  in  a motorola transistor for car radios was the worlds first commercial highpower transistor it was also motorolas first massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first microprocessor mc bit was introduced in  and was used in automotive computing and video game applications motorolas next generation bit microprocessor the mc led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in  powering devices from companies such as apple commodore atari sega sun and hewlettpackard in the s motorolas technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for antilock brake systems one of the first microelectromechanical systems mems inertial sensor for automotive airbags and motorolas mpc microprocessor deployed telematic systems for general motors onstar systems since then freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer medical networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the worlds first tubingfree wireless

massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first

the divestiture of the semiconductor products sector of motorola in  in  a motorola transistor for car radios was the worlds first commercial highpower transistor it was also motorolas first massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first microprocessor mc bit was introduced in  and was used in automotive computing and video game applications motorolas next generation bit microprocessor the mc led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in  powering devices from companies such as apple commodore atari sega sun and hewlettpackard in the s motorolas technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for antilock brake systems one of the first microelectromechanical systems mems inertial sensor for automotive airbags and motorolas mpc microprocessor deployed telematic systems for general motors onstar systems since then freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer medical networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the worlds first tubingfree wireless

states district court wd texas austin division october   order andrew w austin magistrate judge before the court is plaintiff freescale semiconductor incs motion to compel discovery regarding the intentional destruction of evidence dkt no  defendant maxim integrated products incs response dkt no  and plaintiff freescale semiconductor incs reply dkt no  the district court referred the above motion to the undersigned magistrate judge for disposition pursuant to  usc § ba fed r civ p  and rule c of appendix c of the local rules of the united states district court for the western district of texas local rules for the assignment of duties to united states magistrate judges i general background this case arises out of a copyright infringement dispute involving the alleged improper use of copyrighted software by defendants maxim integrated products inc maxim and tanju yurtsever yurtsever plaintiff freescale semiconductor inc freescale alleges that maxim and yurtsever misappropriated freescales proprietary and confidential software and begain illegally copying andor creating derivative works of it to support maxims operations    dkt no  ¶  freescale further charges maxim and yurtsever with stealing freescales trade secrets reproducing system concepts processes strategies architecture and designs id prior to his employment at maxim yurtsever had spent eighteen years with freescale where he worked on enhancing and developing software for freescales manufacturing processes including custom dispatching software id ¶¶   in  several freescale employees including yurtsever terminated their employment with freescale to work at maxim id ¶  upon ending his employment at freescale yurtsever was reminded that he had been given access to freescales proprietary and confidential information and that the work he would be doing at maxim could very well result in the disclosure of freescales information id ¶  yurtsever was also directed to collect and return all freescale property including all freescales proprietary and confidential information that yurtsever possessed regardless of whether the information was stored at freescale or otherwise id ¶  despite these warnings freescale alleges that yurtsever failed to return all of freescales proprietary and confidential information instead freescale asserts that yurtsever knowingly took all of the freescale source code on which he had worked id this allegation stems from an anonymous tip freescale received in  which disclosed to freescale that its proprietary and confidential software were being used at maxim and displayed in presentations shown at maxim id ¶  freescale filed the instant suit on january   after this case was filed freescale learned that maxim had received an anonymous whistleblower submission in late  informing maxim that freescales proprietary and confidential software was being improperly used at maxim by its employees including yurtsever dkt no  at  according to freescale in or around april  yurtsever met with maxims legal department regarding the allegations that he was using freescales confidential software information id yurtsever then proceeded to delete information on several external hard drives and flash drives containing freescale software code and freescale documents id shortly thereafter yurtsever physically destroyed the external hard drives using a screwdriver and also broke the flash drives in half disposing of the remnants in the trash id yurtsever claims that he misunderstood the instructions provided to him by maxim regarding the preservation of evidence believing that he was only required to preserve evidence on maxim property id at  based on these findings freescale filed the instant motion on september   seeking discovery relating to a the anonymous whistleblower submission and b the communications between yurtsever and maxim which led to the intentional destruction of key evidence in this case id in particular freescale requests the court to compel discovery on the following topics  maxims correspondence with the anonymous whistleblower via ethicspoint  maxims correspondence with yurtsever in april  regarding evidence preservation collection or production and  depositions of any maxim employee who in april  discussed evidence preservation collection or production with yurtsever id the court conducted a hearing on october   ii analysis in its motion to compel discovery freescale argues that it is entitled to discovery involving maxims communications with the anonymous whistleblower including the initial submission as well as the followup messages because such communications are not protected by the attorneyclient privilege dkt no  at  freescale submits that the anonymous whistleblower submission and subsequent communications were not made by a client or for the purpose of seeking legal advice id at  freescale also contends that whether the information submitted by the anonymous whistleblower was reviewed by an attorney is irrelevant to the question of whether the information is protected by the attorneyclient privilege because the ethicspoint website does not inform the potential whistleblower that an attorney will review the submission and in any event maxims attorneys represent the interests of maxim not its employees individually id at  alternatively freescale argues that communications between the anonymous whistleblower and maxim are not protected by the work product privilege id at  maxim responds that there is overwhelming evidence that the whistleblower was a maxim employee dkt no  at  given the evidence that the whistleblower was a maxim employee and that any anonymous report would go to the maxim chief compliance officer who the maxim website identifies as the companys general counsel and relying on the supreme courts decision in upjohn co et al v united states et al  us   maxim argues that any communication between a maxim employee and the company conducted through the ethicspoint website is protected by the attorneyclient privilege dkt no  at  the parties main disagreement involves the scope of the attorneyclient privilege and the extent to which the supreme courts decision in upjohn applies to the circumstances of this case at the hearing freescale put forth two primary arguments supporting its contention that maxims communications with the anonymous whistleblower are not protected by the attorneyclient privilege namely that  there is no evidence in the record suggesting that a person making a submission through maxims ethicspoint portal would expect to receive legal advice or that the submission would be reviewed by an attorney and  there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the anonymous whistleblower was a maxim employee concerning the application of upjohn freescale contends that  the circumstances in this case do not arise in the same factual or procedural context as upjohn and  the anonymous whistleblower has not been conclusively shown to be a maxim employee on the other hand maxim submits that upjohn does not stand for the proposition that an employee who reports potential issues to a company needs to be seeking legal advice in order for the attorneyclient privilege to attach rather the communication need only be with an individual who has the ability to seek legal advice on behalf of the company additionally maxim points this court to the companys code of conduct arguing that the policy clarifies that any reports of potential issues would be reviewed by maxims chief compliance officer who is also maxims general counsel at the hearing at the courts request maxim submitted a copy of the disputed document as well as its first supplemental privilege log for the court to review in camera after considering the parties arguments as well as the document at issue the court will grant in part and deny in part freescales motion to compel discovery as it pertains to maxims communications with the anonymous whistleblower the attorneyclient privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law upjohn  us at  the purpose of the attorneyclient privilege is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice id a corporate client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and prevent its attorneys from disclosing confidential communications between its representatives and its attorneys when the communications were made to obtain legal services nguyen v excel corp  fd   th cir  the privilege applies not only to communications with outside counsel but also to communications between a client corporation and its inside counsel see ahf community development llc v city of dallas  f r d   nd tex  in upjohn the supreme court considered in part a dispute over whether written questionnaires completed by upjohns foreign affiliate managers were protected by the attorneyclient privilege  us at  in that case independent accountants had notified upjohns general counsel that at least one of its foreign subsidiaries had made improper payments to a foreign government in order to obtain government business id at  after consulting with outside counsel upjohns general counsel decided to initiate an internal investigation into these alleged payments id a questionnaire was then sent to all of upjohns foreign managers informing them that the companys general counsel had been tasked with conducting an investigation into the alleged payments to foreign governments and seeking detailed information about these payments id the managers were instructed that the investigation was highly confidential and to only speak with employees who might be able to assist in the investigation id in deciding how broadly the attorneyclient privilege applied in this context the supreme court ultimately rejected the control group test applied by the sixth circuit court of appeals finding the test to be too restrictive to achieve the purposes of the privilege and too difficult to apply in practice id at  in reaching its conclusion the supreme court explicitly recognized that the attorneyclient privilege does not only extend to senior management officers but also middle and lowerlevel employees who have information that could be used by the corporations lawyers to provide legal counsel to the corporation id at  middlelevel and indeed lowerlevelemployees can by actions within the scope of their employment embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties because the communications in the questionnaires concerned matters within the scope of the employees corporate duties and the employees themselves were sufficiently aware that they were being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal advice the supreme court determined that the completed questionnaires were protected by attorneyclient privilege and not subject to discovery id at  emphasis added here the anonymous whistleblower made three submissions via the ethicspoint portal used by maxim an initial submission was made on december   and two followup communications were submitted on december   and february   maxims chief compliance officer and general counsel ed medlin communicated with the anonymous whistleblower twice via ethicspoint—once on december   in response to the initial submission and again on february   in response to the whistleblowers submission on february   upon review of the documents containing these discussions the court determines that the initial submission made by the anonymous whistleblower on december   is not protected by the attorneyclient privilege and should be produced the initial submission is distinguishable from the questionnaires at issue in upjohn because it was made prior to the start of any investigation by maxim into the specific allegations that freescales software was being improperly used at maxim there is also insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the anonymous whistleblower was seeking legal advice or that this information was somehow solicited by maxim in order for maxims legal counsel to render legal advice to the company consequently the court concludes that the initial submission by the anonymous whistleblower is not protected by the attorneyclient privilege and must be produced however the subsequent communications between ed medlin and the anonymous whistleblower via ethicspoint are protected by the attorneyclient privilege this includes communications made via ethicspoint by the anonymous whistleblower to ed medlin on december   and february   as well as the communications made by ed medlin to the anonymous whistleblower on december   and february   in the initial communication the whistleblower identifies him or herself as a maxim employee the content of the subsequent communications show that more specific information was being solicited from the anonymous whistleblower—a maxim employee—in order for maxims general counsel ed medlin to investigate the allegations and render legal advice to maxim additionally the content of the followup communications also clarifies that the messages were exchanged after maxim had started its investigation into the anonymous whistleblowers claims these facts align the circumstances of the subsequent communications with the situation in upjohn where the supreme court determined that information given by upjohn employees in response to questionnaires that were meant to assist an internal investigation was protected by the attorneyclient privilege as such the court will deny freescales motion to compel with respect to the subsequent communications via ethicspoint between the anonymous whistleblower and ed medlin freescale points this court to a recent decision from the eastern district of tennessee leazure v apria healthcare inc no   wl  ed tenn aug   as support for its contention that the communications between the anonymous whistleblower and maxim are not privileged and should be produced see eg dkt no  at  however freescales reliance upon leazure is unconvincing for two reasons first as freescale acknowledged at the hearing the court in leazure primarily considered whether the documents in dispute were protected by tennessees attorneyclient privilege rather than federal law concerning the privilege see eg leazure  wl  at  secondly given that maxim has submitted the disputed document for the courts in camera review the court has been able to carefully evaluate the subsequent communications based on the specific content and information contained therein as such the court declines to adopt freescales reliance upon leazure finally because the court finds the subsequent communications between the anonymous whistleblower and ed medlin to be protected by the attorneyclient privilege the court need not reach the question of whether the communications from ed medlin to the anonymous whistleblower on december   and february   are further protected by the work product privilege iii conclusion in accordance with the foregoing discussion the court hereby grants in part and denies in part freescales motion to compel discovery regarding the intentional destruction of evidence dkt no  freescales motion is granted to the extent it seeks production of the initial submission by the anonymous whistleblower freescales motion is denied to the extent it seeks production of the subsequent communications between the anonymous whistleblower and maxims chief compliance officer and general counsel maxim shall produce the responsive document no later than november   furthermore the court hereby dismisses without prejudice the portion of freescales motion to compel discovery concerning whether it is entitled to discover communications between maxim and yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence footnotes  prior to the hearing on october   the parties represented to the court that they had reached an agreement concerning the issue of whether freescale is entitled to discover communications between maxim and yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence dkt no  pursuant to the parties resolution on that issue freescale agreed to withdraw that part of its motion to compel discovery without prejudice id as such the court will dismiss without prejudice the portion of freescales motion to compel discovery concerning whether it is entitled to discover communications between maxim and yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence  at the hearing and in the briefing a significant point of contention was whether the anonymous whistleblower was actually a maxim employee in the initial submission the anonymous whistleblower indicates that heshe is a maxim employee and that the allegations contained therein were based on personal observations based on the information provided the court concludes that maxim has sufficiently demonstrated that the anonymous whistleblower was a maxim employee at the time the submission

first commercial highpower transistor it was also motorolas first massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first microprocessor mc bit was introduced in  and was used in automotive computing and video game applications motorolas next generation bit microprocessor the mc led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in  powering devices from companies such as apple commodore atari sega sun and hewlettpackard in the s motorolas technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for antilock brake systems one of the first microelectromechanical systems mems inertial sensor for automotive airbags and

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
