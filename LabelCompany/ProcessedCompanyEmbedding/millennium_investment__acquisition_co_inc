expense   income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes current and deferred tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income oci in which case it is recognized in equity or in oci   the group calculates the period income tax expense using the tax rate that would be applicable to the expected total annual earnings the group consolidated effective tax rate for the six months ended september   is  and september   is    deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes   business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets   the group accounts for its “business combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business measured at their acquisition date fair values acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred   goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis based on a number of factors including operating results business plans and future cash flows   intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets or in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortization based on their estimated useful lives as follows   customerrelated intangible assets  years   intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized   at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its nonfinancial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated goodwill is tested annually for impairment   sharebased compensation   the grantdate fair value of equitysettled sharebased payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period of the awards the amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service conditions are expected to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service conditions at the vesting date   interests in equityaccounted investees   the group’s interests in equityaccounted investees comprise interest in a joint venture   a joint venture is an arrangement in which the group has joint control whereby the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated   interest in joint venture are accounted for using the equity method they are initially

could have been or could be converted into us dollars at such a rate or any other rate   d use of estimates and judgments   the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates   estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected     a information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are as follows   measurement of defined benefit obligation liability for longservice leave key actuarial assumptions   the projected benefit obligation and expense related to the group’s pension and nonpension postretirement benefit plans are determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts actuarial assumptions including discount rates compensation increases attrition rates and mortality rates are management’s best estimates and are reviewed annually with the group’s actuaries the group develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the group in conjunction with market related data and considers if the marketrelated data indicates there is any prolonged or significant impact on the assumptions the discount rate used to measure plan obligations is based on longterm high quality government bond yields the other assumptions are also longterm estimates all assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty differences between actual experiences and the assumptions as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations result in actuarial gains and losses which are recognized in other comprehensive income during the period and also impact expenses in future periods          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated   recognition of deferred tax assets availability of future taxable profit against which carryforward losses can be used   deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible the group considers the expected reversal of deferred tax assets and projected future taxable income in making this assessment the amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable however could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced   impairment of trade receivable and loan and advance to customers   the group estimates the uncollectability of trade receivables and loans and advances to customers by analyzing historical payment patterns customer concentrations customer creditworthiness and current economic trends if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates additional allowances may be required     b information about significant areas of judgment in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements are described as follows   principal and agent relationship   the group determines that when other parties are involved in providing goods or services to an group’s customer whether its performance obligation is to provide the goods or services itself ie the group is a principal or to arrange for another party to provide the good or service ie the group is an agent the group is a principal if it controls a promised good or service before it transfers the good or service to a customer however the group is not necessarily acting as a principal if it obtains legal title only momentarily before the good or service is transferred to a customer   the determination of whether the group is acting as a principal or an agent affects the amount of revenue the group recognizes   when the group is the principal in the arrangement revenue to be recognized is based on the gross amount to which the entity expects to be entitled   when the group is the agent the revenue to be recognized is the net amount to which the entity is entitled to retain in return for its services as the agent   the group acts in its principal capacity for trading activity undertaken on its own account whereas it is an agent for all trading positions taken by its clients    new standards and interpretation not yet

from the application of ifrs    ifrs  leases on january   the international accounting standards board issued the final version of ifrs  leases  ifrs  will replace the existing leases standard ias  leases  and related interpretations   the standard sets out the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract ie the lessee and the lessor ifrs  introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than  months unless the underlying asset is of low value currently operating lease expenses are charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income the standard also contains enhanced disclosure requirements for lessees the effective date for adoption of ifrs  is annual periods beginning on or after january   though early adoption is permitted for companies applying ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers  the group

loans to customers and         e meeting expenses incurred for operations   management of liquidity risk   working capital requirements fluctuate on a regular basis depending on the business requirements the group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible to have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due under both normal and stressed conditions without

facilities from banks and financial institutions against pledge of trading assets except derivative assets term deposits receivables from clients and inventories by maintaining sufficient liquid funds

information from business units regarding the liquidity profile of their financial assets and liabilities and projected cash flows central treasury maintains surplus funds in cash and cash equivalents including term deposits with banks and in investment securities for which there is an active and liquid market these assets can be readily sold to meet liquidity requirements hence the group believes

in equities fixed income securities commodities foreign currency and their derivatives mainly for availing arbitrage opportunities all financial assets and liabilities are accounted on fair value basis management actively monitors its market risk by reviewing the effectiveness of arbitrage and setting outstanding position limits the group manages market risk with central oversight analysis and formation of risk policy specific maximum risk levels to which the individual trader must adhere to and real time continuous monitoring by the senior management   in respect of the proprietary positions the group is exposed to volatility in the price of the underlying securities          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all

assets trading liabilities derivatives and inventories excluding debt securities   the group engages in proprietary transactions into equities commodities and derivatives equities commodities and currencies these transactions are primarily undertaken using various arbitrage models to capitalize pricing inefficiencies in the markets any change in the market prices of their underlying would result in changes in the fair value of these trading assets trading liabilities and inventory and also result in profitloss on futures positions an increase of underlying prices by  for the exposures at march   and september   with all other variables held constant would decreaseincrease the profit before tax by inr  and inr  for the year ended march   and six months ended september   respectively and similarly a decreaseincrease in underlying prices by  will increase profit before tax by inr  and inr  for the year ended march   and for the six months ended september   respectively in case of options the group uses black scholes pricing model to estimate the potential impact on profit or loss arising from movement in the prices of underlying   investment securities excluding debt securities   a change in the fair value of assets subject to price risk by  for the exposures at march   and september   with all other variables held constant will increase or decrease profit before

 and inr  for the year ended march   and six months ended september   respectively a decrease in interest rate by  for the exposures at march   and september   with all other variables held constant will increase profit before tax by inr  and inr  for the year ended march   and six months ended september   respectively          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated     b interest rate risk   interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have effects on the group’s net income or financial position changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expenses resulting from interestbearing assets and liabilities interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates   the group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the loans taken from banks investment in term deposits placed with banks investment in debt securities and investments of its excess funds in liquid instruments a majority of the financing of the group has come from overdraft facility with banks the business of the group is exposed to fluctuation in interest rate for the following activities     i term deposits placed with banks are generally for short term on fixed interest rates         ii facilities availed from banks and other financial institutions generally include short term working capital loans on floating interest rates         iii interest paid by group on clients’ funds earmarked as fixed margin are generally for short term on fixed interest rates         iv loans and advances on fixed rate basis expose the group to interest rate risk   management of interest rate risk   interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having preapproved limits for repricing bands however the group does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk   the group’s investments in majority of term deposits with banks are for both short and long duration and therefore do not expose the group to significant interest rate risk further significant portion of exposure on term deposits with banks is offset with clients’ funds earmarked as margins on fixed rate basis the interest rates on the overdraft facility availed are marginally higher than the interest rates on term deposits with the banks and generally linked to the term deposit rates with the bank accordingly there is limited interest rate risk exposure on the company   interest from the customers on loans given is fixed rate of interest in order to manage interest rate risk exposure our loan portfolio can be classified between on demand loans and term loans however the interest rate risk exposure on short term loans is insignificant we are exposed to fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate loans   the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the group’s shortterm and longterm debt obligations with floating  fixed interest rates which are included in loans and borrowings in the condensed consolidated financial statements the loans and borrowings as of march   and september   represent loans and borrowing taken both fixed and floating interest rate          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated   cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments   an increase in interest rate by  on outstanding balance as at march   and september  with all other variables held constant will decrease profit before tax by inr  and inr  for the year ended march   and six months ended september   respectively a decrease in interest rate by  on outstanding balance as at march   and september   will have an equal but opposite impact on profit before tax for the periods then ended this analysis assumes that all other variables such as foreign currency exchange rate regulatory requirements etc remain constant   fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments   based on the outstanding balances as at march   and september   an increase in annual interest rate by  with all other variables held constant would have decreased profit before tax by inr  and inr  for the year ended march   and six months ended september   respectively a decrease in interest rate by  outstanding balance as at march   and september   will have had an equal but opposite impact on profit before tax for the periods then ended this analysis assumes that all other variables such as foreign currency exchange rate regulatory requirements etc remain constant   a summary of the group’s interest rate gap position on nontrading portfolios is as follows   click to enlarge          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated     c currency risk   the group is not significantly exposed to currency risk as there is no mismatch between the currencies in which sales of services purchase of goodsservices and borrowings are dominated and the respective functional currencies of group companies further the functional currencies of the group companies are primarily the indian rupee and us dollars and do not expose the group to significant currency risk the group considers the valuation changes in foreign currency derivatives it trades in as part of investmentprice risk as those derivatives are exchange traded managed and monitored based on exchange price and are settled in near term in indian rupees          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated    fair values   a number of the group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities   the group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values the group chief financial officer has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements including level  fair values the audit committee regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments   the value of group assets and liabilities at carrying and fair value is given below   click to enlarge   for all other liabilities the book value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value   significant valuation issues if any are reported to the group’s audit committee   when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses market data as far as possible fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows     ● level  quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities this category includes active exchange traded equity securities debt securities derivatives and mutual funds         ● level  inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices this category includes debt securities and preference shares         ● level  inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs          smc global securities limited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  continued all amounts in indian rupees unless otherwise stated   if the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized in different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement   when applicable further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability

otherwise stated   level    this category comprises debts securities term deposits vehicle loans and advance margin received from clients in the form of fixed deposit classified under trade and other payable the valuation is based on similar contracts that are traded in an active market or the quotes obtained by the management for similar transactions   level    valuation technique and reconciliation of level  fair value   loans and advances to customers   for loans and advances to customers fair value is estimated using valuation models such as discounted cash flow techniques input into the valuation techniques includes expected lifetime credit losses interest rates prepayment rates and secondary market transactions   the fair value has been computed by discounted cash flow technique at incremental rate of borrowings of    investment securities   particulars   amount   balance as at april          balance as at september           balance as at april           purchase
