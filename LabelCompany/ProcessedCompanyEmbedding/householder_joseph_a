reviews recipes spotlight stories great blogs advertise dollys designs monday january   items won and joseph joseph product review i wanted to share these fabulous items with you that i was lucky enough to win from joseph joseph you may remember a post id done over at dolly is cooking three years ago about one of their chopping block sets that i purchased  i brought that review over to this website and you can read about it here  the set i won is the index steel set of  large colourcoded chopping boards with stainlesssteel storage case located at joseph joseph here my product review will give you some information about the product just in case youre interested in purchasing one look at this gorgeous one i won recently it is very similar to the one i own the tab coloring is one of the major differences my daughter catie recently got married so i gave the newest chopping block to her it fits nicely in their new kitchen because it is compact i asked her how she liked it and this is what she said i love that thing  i use it everyday  i do believe she likes it we use our joseph joseph chopping block almost daily around here as well we absolutely love the salad bowl hands on salad bowl this bowl is so very handy  it holds a lot of salad and when you are ready to toss and serve the hands are there for easy use  the fit onto the bowl and can be stored that way when washed and dried  i love the convenience hands on salad bowl not in stock now i dont know if they will restock it but if you find one i suggest you buy it love it turner tongs located at joseph joseph here these are different because they are as stated turner tongs  they make it easy to turn foods that otherwise might be a little tricky with regular tongs i havent used them extensively yet but can tell you i really like them they store easily in a drawer or utensil crock milly salt  pepper grinders  pictured in top photo i like the compact size milly salt  pepper grinders located at joseph joseph here i havent had the chance to use these at all but you can read all about the excellent reviews here catcher citrus reamer with pip catcher located at joseph joseph here this little reamer is quite handy i really like it i have a lot reamerjuicers but this one just may be my favorite flavouriser in tenderising and flavouring tool located at joseph joseph here in flavoring tool textured side for tenderizing flat side for flattening pestle top for grinding citrus reamer end for juicing how handy is that i can tell you very handy it is heavy weight but that is a plus i really like this item for sure  the weight makes for quick time in tenderizing flattening juicing grinding  it is an excellent kitchen tool ill let you in on a secret i also was using it to pop the head of my mixer back on tightly i still have the kitchenaid and it has had quite a busy life but chuck with carlys help found and bought a new kitchenaid mixer for my birthday i am having to get used to that powerful motor and the lift bowl but it also works quickly so this tool is retired from bopping the mixer head back on i have placed the old kitchenaid mixer in the kitchen appliance retirement home as for the  in  flavoring tool it is hard at work doing what it was meant to do and doing very well ive yet to find a joseph joseph product that i dont enjoy using and regularly too i recommend these highly disclosure  i won these products but was not asked to review  ive done the product review on my own because from time to time if i really like a product i do review the opinions are my own as usual

quackery health fraud and intelligent decisions send this page to a friend      dr joseph mercola ordered to stop illegal claims stephen barrett md joseph mercola do who practices in schaumburg illinois also operates one of the internets largest and most trafficked health information sites since  mercola has stated that his site has over  pages and is visited by millions of people each day and that his electronic newsletter has over one million subscribers  the site vigorously promotes and sells dietary supplements many of which bear his name for many years dr mercola and other staff members saw patients at his clinic which was called the optimal wellness center in  mercola announced that about one third of his new patients were autistic and that he had treated about  such children with secretin a hormone he said appeared to be a major breakthrough  it is now well settled that secretin is ineffective against autism  but mercolas web site still says it works if a child complies with his recommended diet strategies  in  medical economics reported that mercolas practice employed  people and that he employed  people to run his newsletter including three editors  much of his support has come from chiropractors who promote his newsletter from their web sites two of his books hit the  sales rank on amazon books shortly after his newsletter plugged them for the first time in  an article in business week concluded that he was one of a fastgrowing number of alternativehealth practitioners who seek to capitalize on concerns about the conventional health care system—in his case relying on slick promotion clever use of information and scare tactics the article described how his promotions included a promises of free to sell stuff a lots of bonuses c reports of real news that link to marginally related products and d exaggerated claims  in  an article in chicago magazine reported that mercola had stopped practicing medicine six years previously to focus on his web site  however his decision may have been influenced by a year battle with the illinois department of financial and professional regulation  i did not see any mention of this on his web site and the site invited patients to come to his clinic—which was renamed dr mercolas natural health center—for detoxification chiropractic dispensary emotional freedom technique eft functional medicine program homeopathy neurostructural integration technique nst nutritional consultation nutritional typing test thermography total body modification tbm and active isolated stretching in september  mercola announced that he had closed the clinic in order to devote his full time and attention to research education and increasing public awareness  many of mercolas articles make unsubstantiated claims and clash with those of leading medical and public health organizations for example he opposes immunization  fluoridation  mammography  and the routine administration of vitamin k shots to the newborn  claims that amalgam fillings are toxic  and makes many unsubstantiated recommendations for dietary supplements mercolas reach has been greatly boosted by repeated promotion on the dr oz show mercolas profits mercola is very critical of drug company profits and proudly states mercolacom does not accept any thirdparty advertising or sponsorship and i am in no way tied into any pharmaceutical company or any other corporate interest whatsoever so you get the real inside scoop on health issues with practical advice that matters to you untainted by outside influence  he also states mercolacom is not    a tool to get me a bigger house and car or to run for senate i fund this site and therefore am not handcuffed to any advertisers silent partners or corporate parents    profit generated from the sale of the products i recommend goes right back into maintaining and building a better site a site that startling as it may be with all the greedmotivated hype out there in health care land is truly for you  i dont doubt mercolas sincerity—and i know nothing about how he allocates his income but the blockshopper chicago web site states that in  he purchased a house in south barrington illinois for  million and that it now has  square feet the bing maps aerial view indicates that the property is quite luxurious   in  mercola announced the formation of health liberty a nonprofit coalition whose goals include promoting organic foods and targeting fluoridation vaccination genetically modified foods and the use of amalgam fillings  in a video accompanying the announcement mercola stated that he planned to donate  million to catalyze the project in addition to mercolacom the coalition members are national vaccine information center nvic which understates the benefits and exaggerates the risks of vaccination fluoride action network fan the leading promoter of misinformation about fluoridation its donations are funneled through the nonprofit american environmental health studies project institute for responsible technology which understates the benefits and exaggerates the risks of genetically modification of foods consumers for dental choice which vigorously attacks amalgam use with misinformation propaganda lobbying and lawsuits organic consumers association which irresponsibly promotes unpasteurized milk and spreads false alarms about food irradiation agricultural biotechnology and vaccines the money for the donations was funneled from mercolacom health resources llc through mercolas nonprofit natural health resources foundation which showed the following grants on its tax returns       total consumers for dental choice      national vaccine information center      organic consumers association      american environmental health studies project      the health freedom argument involves deception by misdirection it focuses on individual freedom but does not consider how people who fail to protect their health put the rest of society at physical andor financial risk failing to vaccinate for example decreases herd immunity so that contagious diseases spread more widely in  mercola began calling his newsletter health liberty newsletter in  williamette week reported that mercola had donated a total of  in cash and inkind contributions that included polling and a youtube video to support the efforts of the antifluoridation group that is opposing a fluoridation referendum in portland oregon the report also stated that mercola has questioned whether hiv causes aids suggests that many cancers can be cured by baking soda and warns parents not to vaccinate their children he also says that animals are psychic  better business bureau reports mercola markets his supplements through mercola health resources llc in  after a customer complained that she thought a product she purchased was overpriced i began checking whether the better business bureau had received any complaints i found that the company was rated c on a scale of a through f on february   the bbb reported that during the previous  months there were  complaints—which is not an unusually high number for a highvolume business—but the report contained the following comments a recent review of consumer complaints filed with the bbb of chicago  northern illinois against your mercola health resources llc delineates a pattern of consumer allegations consumers are alleging that mercola health resources does not honor the  moneyback guarantee listed on your website customers have reported that refunds have not been provided for returns that were specifically covered under this guarantee consumers have also reported that they have experienced delivery issues while wwwmercolacom states that orders ship within  business days consumers say they have waited much longer for their products customers allege that the companys service staff has been unable to provide explanations regarding this delay some consumers have also reported that mercola provided them with shipment tracking numbers that were not valid with their respective carriers  on november   i checked again and found that during the previous  months there had been  complaints but mercola health resources was rated a in september  i checked and found that there had been  complaints but the rating remained a in january  i checked again and found there had been  complaints and the rating was a fda warnings in  the fda ordered mercola and his optimal wellness center to stop making illegal claims for products sold through his web site  the claims to which the fda objected involved three products living fuel rx claimed to offer an exceptional countermeasure against cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes autoimmune diseases etc tropical traditions virgin coconut oil claimed to reduce the risk of heart disease and has beneficial effects against crohns disease irritable bowel syndrome and many infectious agents chlorella claimed to fight cancer and normalize blood pressure in  the fda sent mercola and his center a second warning that was based on product labels collected during an inspection at his facility and on claims made on the optimum wellness center web site  this time the claims to which the fda objected involve four products vibrant health research chlorella xp claimed to help to virtually eliminate your risk of developing cancer in the future fresh shores extra virgin coconut oil claimed to reduce the risk of heart disease cancer and degenerative diseases momentum health products vitamin k possibly useful in treating certain kinds of cancer and alzheimers disease momentum health products cardio essentials nattokinase nsksd claimed to be a much safer and effective option than aspirin and other pharmaceutical agents to treating heart disease the warning letters explained that the use of such claims in the marketing of these products violates the federal food drug and cosmetic act which bans unapproved claims for products that are intended for curing mitigating treating or preventing of diseases intended use can be established through product labels catalogs brochures tapes web sites or other circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product in  the fda ordered mercola to stop making claims for thermography that go beyond what the equipment he uses medtherm infrared camera was cleared for the warning letter said that statements on mercolas site improperly imply that the meditherm camera can be used alone to diagnose or screen for various diseases or conditions associated with the breast they also represent that the sensitivity of the meditherm med telethermographic camera is greater than that of machines used in mammography the statements to which the fda objected included revolutionary and safe diagnostic tool detects hidden inflammation thermography the newest safe cancer screening tool because measuring inflammation through thermal imaging is a proactive preventative method you can use for detecting disease which significantly improves your chances for longevity and good health additionally thermograms provide reliable and accurate information for diagnosis treatment and prognosis   yes its true thermograms provide you with early diagnosis and treatment assistance in such problems as cancer inflammatory processes neurological and vascular dysfunction and musculoskeletal injury thermography can benefit patients by detecting conditions including arthritis differentiate between osteoarthritis and more severe forms like rheumatoid immune dysfunction fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue digestive disorders irritable bowel syndrome diverticulitis and crohns disease    and other conditions including bursitis herniated discs ligament or muscle tear lupus nerve problems whiplash stroke screening cancer and many many others  in  the chicago tribune reported that mercola had not complied with the fdas order and intended to fight the fda    if they decide to take it further  however in  the illinois department of financial and professional regulation asked mercola to attend an informal conference to discuss a complaint that he was making deceptive claims promoting thermography as a standalone diagnostic tool for detecting cancer and other diseases and is attacking the use of mammograms mercolas web site still promotes thermography and trashes mammography but the site stopped offering thermography appointments later that year—and mercolas special report the safe breast cancer screening test your doctor isnt telling you about is no longer apparent ftc action in  mercola mercolacom llc and mercolacom health resources settled a federal trade commission complaint by agreeing to stop selling tanning beds and to pay to  to cover the cost of refunds and administration of the refund program the defendants were charged with falsely claiming that their indoor tanning devices would enable consumers to slash their risk of cancer and improve
