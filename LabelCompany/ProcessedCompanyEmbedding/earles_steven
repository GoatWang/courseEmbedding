both round and octagonal barrels unless otherwise specified  hole spacing is  front and  rear unless noted prices are for individual blocks except for springfield blocks which are priced as a set shipping is  for the first set  more for each additional set     online ordering of scope blocks may be problematic due to the vast range available  consequently i am going to stay with email or phone ordering   please note that this product line is all directed towards the ° dovetail externaladjustment type of scopes i do not currently carry any products for the modern weaver or picatinny sort of mounts additional scope block informationi certainly do not claim to know everything in this field but with experience many trends have become visible  with that said the following information is provided but is open for correction or rebuttal traditional scope blocks often seem to be described as either  inch wide or  inch wide  in fact they are neither although  is close  original unertl dovetails the rings not the blocks generally measure 9 to a theoretical sharp corner  this matches the older winchester a scope mount dimensions  mva has told me that they cut their mounts to  to a sharp corner which is slightly smaller  its a theoretical number because due to the wear of the cutter or even the wire edm radius a perfectly sharp inside corner on the mount is almost never achieved  this is why if the block has a perfectly sharp corner it is not a good situation  it would hang up on that small nonsharp inside corner of the mount  additionally because these corners may not actually exist measuring an existing scope block or a mount by going across the corners may not give a truly useful dimension the solution for these issues is two things  first the scope block width must be slightly narrower than the mount that its intended to fit  and second the sharp corner of the block should be knocked off  the standard blocks i make are targeted to  across the sharp corner  but the actual top width will be  which gives an intentional small flat allowing for nonsharpcornered mounts or even dirt in the corners  it also makes the edge must less susceptible to damage hole spacings for scope blocks are mostly standardized although slightly odd dimensions  since about 9 or so they seem to have been set at  front and  rear with holes tapped   sometimes the  is   i have old charts which show both  realistically that  difference is not significant  there are numerous exceptions to these rules however  older original stevens rifles premodel  rifles were often drilled at  front and  rear with  holes  i have encountered a handful of rifles where the rear holes are spaced   rather than   in fact a tapemeasure examination of spaced holes will frequently lead to the conclusion that they are spaced at  which is only rarely true  sometimes rifles have been drilled for weavertype mounts and then the holes may be spaced either  or   remington x and series rifles have a spacing on the rear ring of   and a recentlydiscovered remington t oddity is that the factory holes are not  they are s  kimber g has a front sight at the muzzle hole spacing of  note regarding custom blocks or sight mounts  as of june   continuing the need to suspend making odd blocks as oneofakind items  i hope to continue to provide blackfinished standard height and length blocks with odd hole spacings thanks for reading   standard mounts vs posa mounts  how to tell the difference the mount and blocks on the left of the picture are standard unertl mounts        the mount is not split  its solid all the way around      the clamping thumbnut has a cupshaped end and is of one diameter      the clamping nut pushes against one side of the block      the block has a shallow crescent cut also called a thumbnail or smiley cut       the parts to the right are the unertl posa style        the mount is split or sawcut through and squeezes onto the block      the thumbnut is squareended and has two different diameters      the nut pulls the mount together and does not bottom out in the locking cut      the block has a much deeper squarebottomed cut   redfield  scopes can use a standard block for the rimfire mount but require a posatype block for the bigbore mount  the only difference is the clamp screw itself     standard   standard blocks are available in heights of         and   the base has a slight concavity which allows them to mount on either a round or an octagonal barrel  heights are measured from a flat surface  they will sit  to  lower on a round barrel  they have the lymanunertl crescent on one side and the winchester dimple on the other   price  each  and taller  each flatbottom   flatbottom blocks are specifically for mounting on an octagonal barrel  they may rock on old drawfiled barrels in that case use the standard blocks above  heights available are    and     price  each posa   posa blocks are for use with unertl posamount

  price  each black  each colorcased  and  high are  each  black only   colorcased   colorcased blocks are available in several configurations including standard posalyman and flatbottom  heights

blocks  heights available are   and     price  each  9 springfield   these blocks duplicate the blocks provided on 9 springfield rifles  also available in posa configuration  either colorcased or black finish    new for   heights that are  or  taller than the standard  this allows for lowheight scopes such as the lyman to clear the bolt handle   note  a lot of questions have arisen about using springfield blocks or unertl o  e blocks  functionally they are identical  my understanding and i am not an  expert is that the springfield blocks are the style that would have been provided by the armory and that the o  e unertlmade is what unertl would have provided with their scopes if intended for an  rifle  i have seen o  e marked blocks both squareended or somewhat rounded like the springfield ones  adding to the confusion the opinions about colorcased or black finish and for exactly what era seem to be all over the map   price  per set stevens   these blocks are specifically for stevens scopes  they have the originalstyle vshaped locking groove and are available with either stevens holes for  screws  and  spacing or with standard holes   they are also available
