headquarters in bridgeport connecticut  the illustration below was taken from the  hurd atlas and shows the company’s office and manufacturing facilities the holmes  edwards silver co illustration from  hurd atlas but the roots of holmes  edwards goes back to the rogers  brittin silver co which was established in january of   edwin brittin one of the founders of rogers  brittin died suddenly early in   c e l holmes and george edwards acquired rogers  brittin in  and the holmes  edwards silver company was established in bridgeport  to read more about edwin brittin who also founded the

directory fairfield county in the  jewelers circular article below the “variety of wares” manufactured by the holmes  edwards silver co is discussed  among those discussed are “sterling silver inlaid” spoons and forks as well as “gold aluminum” ware   to read more about the “gold aluminum” ware manufactured by holmes  edwards please click here httpsqueenofsiennawordpresscomtablewares jewelers circular article january   vol  noel turner in his book “american silver flatware” discusses how holmes  edwards acquired the william a warner patent for a process which became to be known as “sterling silver inlaid”  in part it reads “…george edwards the president of the holmes  edwards silver company in bridgeport connecticut was reading an article in the scientific american about a patent that had been granted to the warner brothers of syracuse new york  the august   issue carried a smalltype item reading ‘the invention herewith illustrated provides a method of manufacturing plated ware in which parts most exposed to wear are filled with precious metal or alloy as for instance the bottom of the bowl of a spoon or the back of the handle of a fork these being the usual points of rest from which the plating on such articles generally wears off the quickest  in such goods and all plated flatware of a similar kind a recess is made at the points of rest or places of greatest wear and this recess in filled in the process of manufacture with fine or coin silver or other metal used in plating so that after the whole is plated abrasions of these parts will not as in the ordinary plated ware expose the base metal or alloy of which the article is mainly composed  the illustration shows the method of inserting this silver filling in a standard type of silverplated tea spoon’ “the following morning mr edwards dispatched a trusted employee to syracuse and after receiving a favorable report on the operation in the small warner shop arranged for the purchase of the patents rights securing at the same time the services of the inventor william warner  there were many technical difficulties to be overcome before the process was completely feasible for the commercial production but by the time of the columbian exposition in chicago in  the company was awarded a gold medal for the greatest improvement in plated flatware in  years and the holmes  edwards sterling inlay trademark had won new acclaim in the silver trade” the william a warner patents follow w a warner patent no  december   patent  specifications and this later one w a warner patent no  dated march   patent  specifications you will note that the following  ad makes no mention of “sterling inlaid”  the advertisement was for “durham silver metal” a silver colored alloy which holmes  edwards manufactured advertisement from  iron age magazine vol  in  advertising began for the “sterling silver inlaid” line ad from  scribners magazine vol  and this  ad is for holmes  edwards “extra sectional xiv plate” which is what they were offering prior to acquiring the warner patents  as mentioned in the noel turner book there were “many technical difficulties” in the sterling silver inlaid process and while they were working on ironing out those difficulties holmes  edwards still actively advertised their other offerings  iron age volume  issue  by  the kinks had been worked out and serious advertising commenced on the “sterling silver inlaid” line  this orange spoon ad was one of the first  february ladies home journal ad to read more on orange spoons please click on the following httpsqueenofsiennawordpresscomtheeatingoftheorange an october  holmes  edwards ad october  ladies home journal ad note that in the following  ad although “sterling silver inlaid” is prominantly featured the other lines are also mentoned “no  mexican silver no  durham silver silver metal no  nickel silver h and e and no  german silver forks spoons etc”  pen  sunlight sketches of st louis “sterling silver inlaid” advertising really took off in   notice that the following ad mentions that they are guaranteed for  years  holmes  edwards ad an example of  advertising  good housekeeping volume  and the following ad states that “the holmes  edwards silver co are the largest manufacturers of silver table flatware in the country”  it also states that two new steamships “st louis” and “st paul” are to be furnished with “inlaid quality” january  the jewelers circular  horological review in  there was considerable advertising of “sterling silver inlaid” even in cookbooks  king’s highway cookbook an example of a holmes  edwards  christmas ad  the review of reviews vol  an example of  advertising february  new outlook vol  this june  ad mentions “sterling silver inlaid” but it also mentions “xiv” or “extra sectional” quality plate june  new outlook vol  what is interesting about this  holmes  edwards ad is that it doesn’t mention “sterling silver inlaid” or any other of its lines  it doesn’t even mention patterns although the pattern shown is “rialto”  it features a bouillon spoon and offers a booklet about spoons and forks  mcclure’s in  the holmes  edwards

about it thank you reply queenofsienna says may   at  pm you are very welcome…thank you reply priscilla gimple says august   at  pm when did the is appear on homes  edwards silverware patterns am trying to identify and date my set reply queenofsienna says august   at  pm holmes  edwards was one of the original companies that joined together in  to form international silver so the is mark appeared no earlier than  if your pattern predates  see sterlingflatwarefashionscom for a good pattern search that is mark could still appear so it is difficult to date when a particular piece was made reply john valadez says september   at  pm hi is it possible to date a piece or pattern from a picture reply queenofsienna says september   at  pm all i can do is try…my email address is queenofsiennagmailcom reply louise avellino says january   at  pm i have the holmes and edwards flatware purchased  in the romance pattern wondering its worth thank you reply queenofsienna says january   at  pm hi louise i would suggest you click on this link to replacements ltd they have a good inventory of the romance pattern and you can see how they price it httpwwwreplacementscomwebquoteinsromhtm hope this helps susan reply susan says june   at  am thank you for this wonderful article and all the oldtimey ads i wonder how you found them i’m researching a set of silverware i purchased recently—the youth pattern i renamed it for myself “in my youth” because i have always wanted a set of real silverware—even if it is silver plate ever since i was young and purchased a set on sale at macy’s that was over  years ago and my husband immediately made me take it back so i finally got my silverware that i have wanted ever since i was in my youth when i bought it on ebay i had no idea of the pattern name and it took awhile to figure that out now i’m all enamored with this company and the sterling silver inlay reply queenofsienna says june   at  am i am delighted you finally got your silverware thank you for your comments reply katherine hayward says september   at  pm susan… i recently acquired a waiter’s coffeetea set in the youth pattern that i will be putting up for sale would you be interested in it reply queenofsienna says september   at  pm thank you for asking but i’m trying to downsize and am not in the market to buy best wishes sharon

do and – my grandmother was so poor during the depression in chicago i cannot figure out how she got a set of these – maybe a gift any idea how much this was in the ’’s thank you reply queenofsienna says july   at  pm sharon in davis  deibel’s book “silver plated flatware patterns they show a november  ad from the woman’s home companion magazine and lovely lady is one of the featured patterns they offer a  piece service for eight at  in the ad i hope you can find a good home for your set…i’m sure there is someone who will treasure it and use it reply traci williams says october   at  am how do you find how much it is worth reply queenofsienna says october   at  am you could look at the completed items of your pattern on ebay which would tell you how much of your pattern is out there how much interest is in it and what the going price is you could also look at replacementscom holmes  edwards patterns would be found under international silver reply bobbie jo debellefeuille says march   at  pm hello ma’am i have several holmes  edwards’ spoons and am trying to identify a certain one with a shape i have not seen even in their old catalogs i did find out its a napoleon however they do not have a  or any other such marking stating that they are silver and in my research before  that wasn’t really unusual but my question is what was this spoon used for a sugar spoon or a berry spoon or maybe a dessert spoon it has a long slender handle that is ″ long the bottom of the handle has an arrow design on it that is facing the topmouth of the spoon the mouth of the spoon is not round or oval i can only describe it as square with round corners any info you may have may be helpful thanks for your time my email is bobbiejoandjerrygmailcom reply queenofsienna says march   at  pm hi i just sent you an email with an attachment reply mildred brady venitucci says march   at  pm bobbie jo you may have a “citrus spoon” or “grapefruit spoon” — i am wondering if the outside lower edges roll up to almost a point i have a set of these and treasure them i may be wrong but i think holmes  edwards made only silverplate they also bought the patent i am thinking off the top of my year old head here from the first man to develop the process during the great depression when i was raised women would get silverplate and other goodies in boxes of soap that is also when depression glass came into vogue speaking of that i have a set of  place settings of holmes  edwards “century” silverplate with the viande or grill forks most of what i know about this company i found right here on this wonderful woman’s site reply garrett d anderson says march   at  pm i have the last spoon from my family’s silverware set with the english letter “a” for anderson probably bought in the early ’s to early ″s reply sandra winters says march   at  am i have a set of lovely lady  that was my mothers it is in a wooden box marked  on the bottom the inside of the box is lined with blue feltfabric there is a sticker on the inside of the box bottom that says ‘tarnish resistant” do you know when this might have been manufactured was lovely lady manufactured for several years or just in  reply queenofsienna says march   at  am hello i believe lovely lady was manufactured from  to  at which time it was discontinued the box most likely was made during this same period of time reply pam says may   at  pm i just purchase a set of holmes  edwards super plate – inlaid utensils at a fundraiser household sale the pattern appears to be the century pattern and a number of the large spoons have a c on the handle the first thing i did when i got home was to throw them in the dishwasher i’ve been told that i shouldn’t do this as they would become badly pitted if they are silver any idea if these are in fact silver and should i look to only hand wash these reply queenofsienna says may   at  am your century pattern utensils are silver plated it is recommended by professionals that sterling and silverplate items be hand washed as the dishwasher could damage and leave spotting and discoloration on silverplate reply nita leosh says june   at  pm so happy i found this site i have a lovely souvenir spoon marked holmes  edwards xiv in a frame and another small frame containing what could be an is on the resting point of the bowl of the spoon is an embossed flower and leaves the spoon is made on a de sancyroseland pattern in the bowl of the spoon are the words st thomas as in the virgin island can you help me with more information i have searched for another souvenir spoon like it and can find nothing reply queenofsienna says june   at  pm hello i cannot find another one like it either the pattern de sandy roseland was designed by thomas b lashar and patented in  the “is” stands for international silver but that is all i can tell you retailers sometimes engraved spoons with the location to turn them into souvenir spoons and most likely this explains your spoon reply nita leosh says july   at  am thank you so much for taking the time to respond and provide the information that you did i know more than i did before and that is very good chris andrews says july   at  pm what is super plate reply queenofsienna says july   at  pm from a s holmes  edwards ad for super plate “the wear points are protected by an extra heavy deposit of pure silver” reply leave a reply
