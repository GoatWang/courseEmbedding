abu marawat may have the potential to host additional vms deposits like other vms camps in the arabian nubian shield further atons geologists have recognized potential vms style mineralization in the

crocs nose zone south of the main zone the high grade intersection from hole had extends the mineralization previously intersected in surface trench hat and holes aha and aha to the east the mineralization at the crocs nose zone has only had limited testing to date and is interpreted as being a faulted offset of the main zone mineralization which strikes under the nubian sandstone

company said we are very pleased with the support given to us by emra and the ministry of petroleum the extensions to the exploration terms are an important part in providing the company due time to advance both the development of our flagship hamama project at abu marawat and the exploration of our exciting fatiri concession we believe that this decision demonstrates the ministry of petroleums and emras commitment to the development of egypts mineral resource sector emra has been a very helpful and supportive partner and we are very pleased to be working closely with them campbell further commented the positive drilling results at the hamama on the abu marawat concession and the potential bonanza gold grades at rouh al hadid on the fatiri concession confirm the potential for significant deposits within our two concession areas further showing the potential that aton has at two of the most exciting areas anywhere in the world today the award of the term extension to the licenses was a result of emra and the ministry of petroleums recognition of the challenges the company weathered and the delays associated with the political transition in egypt operating environment
