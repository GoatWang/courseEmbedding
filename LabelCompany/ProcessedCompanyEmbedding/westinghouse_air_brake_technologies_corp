earnings release conference call all participants will be in listenonly mode please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to tim wesley please go ahead timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you kate good morning everybody and welcome to our  first quarter earnings call let me introduce the others who are here with me in the room al neupaver executive chairman ray betler our president and ceo pat dugan our cfo and john mastalerz our corporate controller well be happy to take your questions after we make our prepared remarks and of course during the call we will make some forwardlooking statements so we ask that you review todays press release for the appropriate disclaimers al do you want to get started albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah thanks a lot tim good morning everyone our first quarter adjusted earnings were in line with expectations with growth in our transit business offsetting lower revenues in our freight business we expect our sales and earnings to improve each quarter this year and today we affirm the guidance we issued in february ray and pat will discuss our results and operations in detail shortly but before i turn it over to ray id like to comment about the progress weve been making on the integration of our acquisition of faiveley transport an acquisition we completed only a few months ago after completing the purchase of the family stake in december we began a tender offer for the remaining public shares by late march we had acquired more than  ownership which enabled us to move forward with a squeezeout process to complete the transaction in late march as we said before this acquisition represents the most strategic acquisition weve made today and were very excited about the growth opportunities in the synergies we now have a strong position in the global transit market that provides increased diversity of our revenue base across markets across products and across geographies to offset the cyclicality of the us freight market we also have a strong established platform of products and service capabilities in europe and in asia pacific the two largest transit markets in the world with a full range of technologies to serve these as well as other global markets let me give you a little update on the synergy activities we estimate synergies to be about  million to  million in  and we expect the longterm annual synergies of at least  million to be achieved by year three through revenue growth through supply chain efficiencies operational excellence and cost savings and by leveraging our engineering and administrative capabilities in total were tracking more than a  synergy projects we have active projects in every operational and functional area were generating early successes in sourcing new product development optimization tax planning and in reduced redundant activities and resources work on longerterm synergies is also proceeding with a focus on facility consolidation global and market expansion and new product development so once again just a few weeks into the integration process were pleased with the progress of – and excited with the longterm opportunities and benefits we expect to achieve ill turn it over to ray now raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks al financially our performance in the first quarter met earnings expectations with an adjusted eps of  al will cover the adjustments later in his remarks during the quarter our backlog increased  compared to the fourth quarter backlog and our booktobill was  which is a positive indicator were still facing challenging conditions in some of our freight markets and we continue to reduce cost as necessary although we saw freight aftermarket revenues increased for the second quarter in a row which is another positive during the quarter we purchased the remaining shares of faiveley and made good progress on the integration we acquired aero transportation products atp a manufacturer of hatch covers and outlet gates for freight cars with annual sales of about  million we announced the signing of a  million contract to provide signaling and communication services to tex rail and then earlier this month we acquired thermal transfer a manufacturer of heat exchangers in industrial markets with annual sales of about  million and we acquired semvac a europeanbased manufacturer of sanitation systems for transit vehicles with annual sales of about  million so weve been busy running the company daytoday and making strategic investments for the future based on our first quarter performance today we affirmed our  guidance for the year we expect revenues to be about  billion with earnings per diluted share between  and  excluding restructuring and transaction charges and noncontrolling interest related to the faiveley acquisition the midpoint of the eps range represents growth of about   compared to the  adjusted results due to the rampup of projects already in the backlog and the timing of synergies from the faiveley acquisition we expect our revenues and adjusted eps to improve sequentially during the year with more acceleration in the second half accretion from faiveley will increase during the year as projects and synergies kick in other assumptions include the following revenue growth for the year will come from our transit group with the freight group expected to be slightly down faiveley will be accretive but its financial impact will be reduced by expenses for additional interest and a higher share count along with purchase price accounting charges were assuming foreign exchange headwinds of about  million at current rates and our tax rate is now expected to be about  for the year were now assuming diluted shares outstanding of about  million for eps calculation purposes thats a bit higher than the  million we were previously assuming our goals in  remain the same as we discussed earlier in the year those goals are to meet our financial plan to rightsize our business and remain disciplined when it comes to controlling cost to generate cash to invest in growth opportunities while strengthening our balance sheet and to ensure smooth and effective integration process with faiveley and to capture the synergies and growth we expect as always we will strive to control what we can and manage our business effectively our transit markets remained stable both in the us and abroad with new projects expected to ramp up this year and good bidding activity to continue overall reflecting this activity our transit backlog remains at a record high during the quarter we won orders for air conditioning equipment in sweden brakes and couplers in italy brake systems in dubai and in particular our orders for aftermarket services were strong which certainly helps our margin outlook over the next several years the strongest market growth is expected to be in western europe germany france and the uk as well as asia pacific india and australia while talk of infrastructurefocused spending in the us could also provide additional opportunities were bidding on several significant future projects in the us france and australia and expect to announce some of these project wins as we go forward through this year in addition to sales growth we are focused on improving margins in transit many of the synergy projects that al mentioned involve plans that we believe will drive significant margin improvement over time and were committed to delivering on those plans lets turn to the freight markets in nafta freight rail traffic is rebounding after being down for two consecutive years through midapril total traffic was up about  as a result we are seeing a slight pickup in our aftermarket business and we should see more benefits as we go through the year if the rail traffic continues to improve we see no change to our  freight assumptions railroad capex which declined about  in  is expected to be down again in  locomotives down about  worldwide including down about  in nafta freight cars down about  worldwide including about  in nafta combined that represents a headwind of about  million in revenue we have opportunities still to offset most of these headwinds because of our growth strategies and diversified business model aftermarket in the us and elsewhere international projects in places like india acquisitions weve completed in  which will add incremental revenues of about  million through grahamwhite unitrac pride bodies workhorse are all positives to offset the headwinds we continue to focus on growth our priorities for allocating free cash have not changed although we also expect to reduce debt during the year so our use of free cash will be to fund internal growth programs including product development and capex to pursue acquisitions which are strategic and have ample opportunities to deploy capital in this area and thirdly to return money to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock buybacks our current share repurchase authorization program which still exists so we remain focused on increasing free cash flow by managing cost and driving down working capital controlling capital expenditures our corporate strategic growth initiatives continue to be the same were focused on new products and technologies were focused on global expansion were focused on aftermarket expansion and on strategic acquisitions so lets talk about each of these in the area of new products we have always viewed our mission is helping customers to increase their safety productivity and efficiency so our future product roadmap is focused on just that whether its data analytics through electronics and sensors or train control automation using onboard computers we have an extensive pipeline of innovation in both freight and transit around the world were also working on a number of green initiatives which are environmentallyfriendly product developments such as charging systems for electric buses and ferries lowenergy consumption hvac systems and a compact lower weight door mechanism on the global and market expansion front for the quarter sales outside of the us were  million or  of our total revenues examples of recent orders include ecp brake systems and other freight components in australia sensors in wayside monitoring equipment in india and pantographs in south africa in the area of aftermarket expansion sales for the quarter were  million or  of our total as i mentioned we have started to see some slight pickup in our freight aftermarket business due to increased rail traffic in the us if freight traffic continues we expect to see more benefits lets talk about train control and signaling train control and signaling remains an important part of our longterm growth opportunities although its part of the reason why our freight revenues were down in first quarter in first quarter revenues from train control and signaling were about  million for the year we expect them to be flat to slightly up we have been selected for several ptc projects in transit and hope to announce details of those soon some of which are expected to begin later this year longterm we expect ptc in signaling will be a growth business for wabtec based on the following opportunities multiyear maintenance and service agreements which include software and product enhancements international projects and continued growth in signaling through organic investment and acquisitions were beginning to see some evidence that our longterm strategy is working we signed a  million contract to provide signaling and communication services to tex rail for a new commuter rail line in the fort worth texas area we signed several maintenance and service agreements related to train control but once again our new product roadmap includes considerable activity in this particular product area on the acquisition front our pipeline continues to be active and were pleased with the opportunities were reviewing this year so far weve acquired aero transportation products a manufacturer of hatch covers and outlet gates for freight cars with annual sales of about  million which increases our market share thermal transfer a manufacturer of heat exchangers for industrial markets with annual sales of  million which provide synergies with our existing heat exchanger businesses and we acquired semvac a europeanbased manufacturer of sanitation equipment and systems for the transit market with annual sales of about  million which fits with our existing microphor business here in the us so each company meets our strategic criteria either with new products more geographical coverage or strong aftermarket opportunities so with that id like to ask pat to talk about some of the financial details patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay thanks ray so sales for the first quarter were  million and when you look at the breakdown between the segments transit segment sales increased  mostly driven by the faiveley acquisition acquisitions contributed about  million of additional sales fx was a drag actually reducing our transit segment sales by about  million and the rest was flat organic sales for the quarter looking at the freight segment those sales decreased about  we had lower organic sales mainly from ptc from freight oe and aftermarket businesses that was down about  million and it had a small fx impact of about  million and that was offset by some acquisitions of about  million positive in a positive sign freight sales were higher than the prior quarter for the first time in nearly two years and if rail traffic continues to increase we would expect that trend to continue our operating income for the quarter was  million this included transaction expenses of about  million related to the faiveley acquisition of this  million was a onetime purchase price accounting adjustment and included in cost of sales and the rest is reflected in the sga line if you exclude these expenses operating income was  million and about  of sales going forward we expect sga to be about  million per quarter engineering expense and the amortization were up mainly due to the faiveley acquisition and we expect similar run rates for the rest of the year interest and other expense which is a net number was about  million for the first quarter the higher interest expense was due to the borrowings for the acquisition and going forward we expect a similar run rate for interest and other expense although we are focused on generating cash and reducing our debt and the related interest expense throughout the year income tax expense our effective tax rate for the quarter was  and this included an expense of about  million for an adjustment related to the opening balance sheet for the faiveley acquisition going forward we expect our annual effective tax rate to be about  and i always remind you that thats an annual forecast and our quarters may vary due to timing of any discrete items just to help a little bit on the earnings per share and help you reconcile just some more information here our gaap earnings per diluted share for the first quarter about  the effect of the restructuring and transaction expenses the tax adjustment and our noncontrolling interest related to the faiveley acquisition reduced eps by about  so adding that back our adjusted earnings per share was  just to put some numbers and some to this net income per diluted share  in accordance with gaap you add back our onetime ppa in the cost of sale line that was about  you add back the restructuring and transaction expenses in sga about  you add back our tax expense item i referred to thats about  and then a deduction because the noncontrolling interest was actually a positive income item was  that reconciles to  on an adjusted basis so moving to our balance sheet our balance sheet remains strong it provides the financial capacity and flexibility to invest in our growth opportunities as ray outlined them and just i always remind you that we have an investment grade credit rating our goal is to maintain that rating working capital at march  we had receivables about  million inventories were about  million and accounts payable were  million cash on hand at the end of the quarter  million mostly held outside of the us and our debt at the end of quarter  billion and it consisted of  million of year senior notes due in   million of bonds due in  a  million term loan thats a year expiration and then a – i am sorry thats a year expiration and then a revolver for  million thats a year expiration looking at the balance sheet you can see that our net debttoebitda is about  million just a couple of miscellaneous items for the questions we always get our depreciation for the quarter about  million compared to  million in last years quarter for the full year we expect depreciation to be about  million our amortization for the quarter  million compared to  million in last years quarter and for the full year we expect it to be about  million and our capex for the quarter  million compared to an  million for the year were budgeting about  million we tend to lag our budget a little bit every year our backlog at the end of the quarter we have a multiyear backlog it was a record  billion including  billion from faiveley and our booktobill was about  the transit backlog was  billion and freight  million our rolling month backlog which is a subset of the multiyear backlog was  billion transit was  billion and freight about  million so with those comments ill turn it back to ray raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks pat so to summarize our first quarter earnings were in line with expectations and we affirmed our guidance for the year even though we continue to face some challenging conditions in the freight market we continue to stay focused on controlling what we can and on investing in growth opportunities were pleased with the progress were making on integrating faiveley and on our synergy planning were confident that our diversified business model and our balanced growth strategies will enable us to respond to both longterm opportunities as well as shortterm challenges and with that well be happy to answer your questions questionandanswer session operator the first question is from allison poliniak of wells fargo please go ahead allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning allison albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc when we look at the revenue assumption for  of  billion i think last we spoke you talked about potentially a low singledigit organic growth assumption embedded in that based on sort of where we started in q are you still comfortable with that low singledigit or sort of the components of that  billion assumption change raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah were still comfortable with that allison were not surprised by the slow start for the year weve just put it that coming into  our expectations are the freight traffic is going to continue to grow and that were going to pick up in the aftermarket area later in the latter part of the year second half was where our expectations were focused albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp most of the drag in revenue will still come from the transit area keep in mind that our transit projects as we tried to explain on the last call a lot of these projects are queued up and well see revenue recognition getting greater in the second quarter and then with more acceleration in the third and fourth quarter raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah so thats a good point what al explained that also means projects are three year to five year in length so you literally have those programs into revenue plan and with the great backlog that we have and continue to build that revenue stream will systematically build as a result allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc great thanks and then on the ptc and signaling you still talked about flat but you also noted a number of new contracts so we assume there is a time early probably for  and beyond i mean how should we think of the ramp of this and i guess are you hearing any delays push up still in the nearterm raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp well actually the phenomenon in the ptc and signaling area on the signaling side its similar to what al just described for transit projects as you put those big projects there three four five years in length to execute the first part of the project normally is relatively low revenue recognition because its associated with the engineering so you dont start to get equipment revenues and delivery revenues until second and third year so yes those will start to influence us in terms of added revenue more in two to three year time period as far as ptc goes the hardware actually buy  was up in q i think that was fundamentally a pickup or a catchup associated with the shortfall that existed in  we expect most that the hardware for ptc to be bought out this year there may be slight amounts left for  the commissioning will – and integration will probably take place over this year and next year so ptc as youve known it over the last four five years is going to change from hardware to maintenance and service contracts and enhancements and then were going to get more and more of these – hopefully get more and more of these train control and signaling projects which we continue to with allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc perfect thanks so much guys raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator the next question is from jason rodgers of great lakes please go ahead jason a rodgers  great lakes review yes just a followup on that last question on ptc given the shift in mix from hardware to maintenance and service for  would you expect the overall revenues to be higher in  versus  raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no ptc so lets take each component ptc hardware will not be higher in  and  on signaling projects then they will continue to generate revenue were saying for this year we expect the revenue to be about flat obviously next years revenue are going to be influenced by how many new projects we can win we have several new projects that were bidding on and were relatively confident that were going to win so that will influence the revenue stream for next year in the msa revenue weve booked entered into contracts with the majority of the class is theres still a couple left that were negotiating with and that revenue stream well build over time in the first year it will taper up it will grow and then it will reach annual flat revenue base which weve given numbers of about  to  compared to the installed base that we have on ptc hardware albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i think its awful early its early for us to really comment specifically on  but i think its important to note that this is really the focus not only for us but its really the focus of the freight and transit railroads around the world and thats to improve the safety efficiency and productivity and thats exactly what ray talked about when he was talking about his roadmap and that is that we see a lot of opportunities in the signaling area in the onboard train control area in the enhancements and ways of trying to take our installed base of the onboard computer and add features to that that will help in the efficiency and the productivity for the railroads so longterm this is definitely a growth area for us its a segment that were really excited about and one of the areas that we will see growth as far as specifically looking at  well know more as the year goes on but were pretty sure right now based on the backlog and what projects were aware of that our sales should be flat from  to  and possibly even slightly up we could win some more projects and we could get them going jason a rodgers  great lakes review all right thats helpful and then looking at your forecast for your freight business for  are you assuming that freight traffic continues to grow at around that  level or what are the expectations there thanks raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah thats our assumption we dont have any information to assume anything else it seems to be fairly consistent it goes up and down week by week but it seems to be fairly consistent since beginning of the year albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah and it depends a lot on the comparison i mean that number really is a comparison number so what we are planning is that the volumes in the carloadings will improve as the year goes on whether that percentage does or not depends on the comparisons whether they are tough or easier jason a rodgers  great lakes review and then finally it sounds like youve got some positive early signs with the faiveley acquisition i was just wondering if youve seen any material employee turnover increased competition or any other shortterm disruptions from the acquisition raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no we have not the integration has gone very well we havent seen any unexpected losses of key personnel or anything like that i think people are pretty excited in all areas of our corporation about the future jason a rodgers  great lakes review sounds great thanks a lot raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator the next question is from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott h group  wolfe research llc hey thanks good morning guys raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning scott h group  wolfe research llc can we start just on faiveley is there any way where you can give us a number for and how much revenue in the quarter was from faiveley and maybe how much operating income or pretax income was from faiveley and then of the about  million to  million of synergies how much youve realized so far albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp if you looked at the numbers that pat gave most of the increased revenues that we have in the transit area is coming from that acquisition so that comes out about  million or so other than that the internal growth rate is we had a flat business other than that and there was another small acquisition thats added to that number as far as commenting on the margins we typically do not provide that and were going to stay key  to that you have to realize right now there is a lot of different things happening were integrating businesses so its a complex analysis we are in the startup phase as far as getting and realizing synergies you take advantage of some sourcing as i said where were trying to take a look at tax planning were getting synergies here were getting synergies as far as duplication of engineering projects weve got some duplication of actual head count and were tracking all those we had about a  as i said a  different synergy projects that were tracking almost on a twoweek to threeweek basis and weve got the whole team involved on it those synergies the realization of them it will take time and it will grow as the year goes on and into  keeping in mind that we still think that after a run rate in the third year we should be at a  million synergy addition to our current business plan so were pleased where its at weve got a lot of work to do and were really pretty focused on a lot of different areas scott h group  wolfe research llc yeah just so im clear on the way you guys are talking about synergies is the  million to  million a fullyear  number or a run rate synergies by the end of the year albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp full year scott h group  wolfe research llc okay okay so albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp  scott h group  wolfe research llc okay from a full year guidance standpoint i know you talk about a sequential ramp in earnings and if you look at first quarter as a percent of a typical year it implies something a good amount below your guidance so maybe itd be helpful at least would be helpful for me like can you help us think about the sequential progression that youre thinking in terms of second quarter and then third and fourth quarter and what kind of sequential earnings increases youre thinking about just because the model is a little tough right now albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp weve never given quarterly guidance and we really dont want to do it i think that the statements that we made is that we will sequentially get better with more acceleration in the second half there is the business model has changed quite a bit i think traditionally weve only had if you go back to history the first quarter has always been a pretty good quarter the second quarter was – very usually had seasonalization in the third quarter because of the european impact and the fourth quarter was going bank busters and we still expect to see a fall back in that third quarter because of the european effect from a general business level but i dont think youll see much different and the fact that now we are a projectbased business with large transit projects that we know are in our backlog and well kickin as the year goes on and thats the big change because as the models change we were  freight business and the  transit business and its flipflopped scott h group  wolfe research llc okay okay and then just last question just going back to ptc i sometimes go just confused with the numbers in terms of ptc versus total signaling can you give us the breakdown of like the  million of sales last year how much of that was ptc hardware how much was signaling and then maybe what youre thinking for this years ptc versus signaling if thats the right way to break it down timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hey scott this is tim so last year we did about  million in train control and signaling that was about  million in train control and a little under  million in signaling and what we will see then – and thats the extent of the breakdown were not going to get into the details of all the other different line items within those and then this year what weve said is we expect that about  million for train control and signaling to be flat to slightly up we could see the train control piece down a little bit and the signaling up a little bit scott h group  wolfe research llc okay and then the first quarter number that you gave of  million i think was  million what was that was that a total signaling or just ptc timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp it was  million and thats both so thats train control and signaling so thats consistent with the – about  million of those two that we did last year total of last year scott h group  wolfe research llc okay thanks a lot for the time guys appreciate it albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks operator the next question is from justin long of stephens please go ahead justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi justin justin long  stephens inc hi just wanted to ask first about transit revenue it seem like it was a little bit light in the quarter relative to street expectations and i just wanted to clarify was there anything that surprised you in the transit business yeartodate or as you talked about before is this just a timing issue due to the projects that ramp more significantly over the next several quarters raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp there is definitely nothing thats surprised us justin again we have these projects programmed in there its hardcore revenue the only thing that would impact our forecast over the year would be if a project would get cancelled which is extremely unusual in the transit market andor delayed which is not unusual in the transit market but once the project startup normally the projects are not delayed in process so the delays normally come at the front end of the project so you might delay revenue for transit projects casebycase so once those projects start to ramp up and generate revenue its pretty much continuous flow and the project execution again really if you get into the details of when these transit projects are very very predictable so all i can tell you is that we have to your point to scotts point we have a very a detailed forecast and a revenue plan and it supports our expectations for the year justin long  stephens inc okay great and maybe on those transit projects that are ramping could you give some more color on whether those are oe related or aftermarket related or maybe a combination of both just trying to figure out how that ramp in the topline will kind of flow through to margins raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so the majority are oes related and its projects like german highspeed trains where we have brake stores air conditioning we have double deck trains in france where we have brake stores air conditioning auxiliary power supplies pantographs in france we have brake stores electronics in the us we have r we have ptc projects in the transit area which youre aware of so there is a lot of oe but we continue to build our aftermarket the beautiful thing about transit market as weve talked before is that once you have that installed base and were expanding geographically were about to book some very significant orders in the markets i talked about and once you have that installed base youre there for   years and that aftermarket business is good margin business its equal to the aftermarket margins in the freight side so what youre seeing on a topline basis is dominated by only business but we are building our aftermarket justin long  stephens inc thats helpful and maybe one last question longerterm i just wanted to get your view on the outlook for locomotive and the locomotive and railcar cycles in north america and if you think were in a situation where we remain below replacement levels for multiple years are there more aggressive restructuring or cost cutting efforts that you could start to deploy raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah so to be honest justin we havent stopped the cost cutting and restructuring efforts so you know that the freight car build is down as well as the locomotive build is down this year and down significantly if you look at locomotives i just had a meeting with the ge folks last weekend we want you to forecast on a worldwide basis were talking about a significant drop i mentioned  in my comments in this country the build maybe only around  and worldwide maybe  so and car builds down to  where its headed the ge folks i can tell you are focused on international were focused on international thats a benefit of us expand in our geographical footprint over the years now we can localize and support projects there so as far as the trend goes on the freight car side for this year we still are looking at about  i think the build was  or something like that in q and next year the backlog there has been deteriorated next year it could drop again weve said that before it could drop to  could drop to  right now we dont have enough visibility to predict that but were not anticipating freight car builds going up next year and were not anticipating locomotive builds going up so were managing based on the facts we have in front of us which means weve got to cut costs and we got to continue to restructure our business and thats what were doing justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful ill leave it at that i appreciate the time raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator the next question is from saree boroditsky of deutsche bank please go ahead saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc good morning i just had a followup on the questions regarding guidance so you maintain the guidance of around  billion despite the bolton acquisitions and then lower fx headwind so i just want to see if theres anything else that changed in your outlook that offset those raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no the bolton acquisitions theyre relatively small annual revenue but theyre nice strategy acquisitions faiveley was – we closed last year so it was in our plan already so no its again we have a very detailed forecast that supports our revenue guidance saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then i guess theres still a fairly wide range in your eps forecast so i was just wondering if you could just help us understand what needs to happen to reach the higher end of that versus the lower end raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay i felt badly for pat so im going to let him answer the question patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i think the guidance the range on the eps guidance really comes down to some of the seasonality and some of the revenue volumes when they hit and lastly just being cautious on the recovery in the aftermarket business for north america freight so i think weve got a lot of moving – as the questions sort of have focused on correctly a lot of moving parts a lot of changes are occurring with the business were assuming some recovery in north america aftermarket business and also some restructuring in synergies that are coming with the acquisition so a lot of things moving and so were putting a range out there to be careful saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for answering my questions ill get back in queue operator and the next question is from mike baudendistel please go ahead michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you just wanted to see can you provide any comments at all on the potential for siemens rail and bombardier merging i mean what impact would that have on you can you give us a sense for how big a customer is bombardier or how big of a direct competitors is siemens rail and any types of those comments would be great raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah theyre both big customers of ours and theyre one of the big four big three being european at crc and the industry one of the big four worldwide we have no insight into what is going on michael one  between siemens and bombardier other than what we read in the paper rather theres been a lot of consolidation in the industry over four decades ive been in the industry and i suspect its going to continue so what those two decide to do in the end well adjust accordingly bombardier as you know has been rumored to be combined with several other companies in the past so this could just be rumors or superficial discussions who knows but we certainly have no influence or insights michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it thanks for those comments just also wanted to ask you – just on the income statement you talked about interest expense and other income you netted those amount but if you look at them separately and it looked like the other income was a  million favorable impact that you really havent had the last few quarters and i was just wondering is that something thats sustainable or any specific reason for that patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah when we do our guidance we really are anticipating that thats a relatively flat number those are variety of things including gains from fx translation gains and losses on foreign exchange and so we have on occasion had losses – had income there and so just with the change i mean in some of the base currencies for us that we have a slight gain this quarter so going forward were expecting it to be neutral and interest expense to improve as we bring cash and repay debt michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it thanks very much thats all i had raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator and the next question is from sam eisner of goldman sachs please go ahead samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co yeah good morning everyone raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi sam patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co so maybe just to start off with can you talk a little bit about the business through the first  days of the quarter here just q trends across however you guys want to slice it across the segments across the components of the segment just curious how the second quarter is looking for you patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah i think its in line with what our guidance has been and i dont think theres been any big surprises but clearly at  days we continue to focus on all the same things we have talked about which is integrating the businesses and making sure were hitting all our targets and so on that i dont think theres lot more we could talk about raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp the only thing wed say – we just have an awful lot of pending closure on orders right now thats probably a positive and were not seeing any drastically difference between the first and the second quarter just little pickup that were seeing in freight carloadings that continues but theres nothing else thats drastically changing other than the amount of i think large projects that were trying to finalize it samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co thats helpful and maybe continuing on that line can you talk about you mentioned obviously aftermarket is starting to accelerate is there a way to talk about within the first quarter what the growth was within the aftermarket portion of freight timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp sam this is tim if you look at fourth quarter versus first quarter we saw about  million of aftermarket revenue growth in freight from the fourth to the first probably about half of that was acquisitions and then the rest was organic so we have started to see some slight pickup there like we talked about samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co but still down yearonyear timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yes yes still down yearonyear samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co okay timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp comparing the first quarter of this year to first quarter last year yes still down samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co okay and maybe a few other housekeeping items i think you went through a little bit before of the cash flow items i dont know if you commented about what total cash from operations was in the quarter patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp well cash from operations was actually a negative it was about  million negative but thats so that youve got to adjust that number because an awful lot of our deal cost which were accrued for in the fourth quarter were paid okay so when you back out the onetime items its about  million worth of deal costs that were paid in the first quarter that were accrued for at the end of  now then when you look at the normalized performance in terms of cash flow we usually have first quarter is a challenge for us on top of that we have the normal things that get paid in the first quarter some benefits and incentiverelated accruals tax interest a number of items and so we typically have our weakest performance in the first quarter and then it improves throughout the year so nothing that i dont think is normal and we remain on our budget and plan for the full year once you take into account the items that we paid for related to the acquisition samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co thats super helpful and maybe just two other quick questions here just on your nonrail business i think theres been a few pieces of ma within the historical nonrail portion of your freight segment how was that performing throughout the course of the quarter how is that performing versus the fourth quarter certainly theres a lot of positive data points on general industrial market so just curious what youre seeing on that nonrail business raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i think in the industrial business nonrail business is improving were seeing some improvements in the elastomer and rubber business were seeing some improvements in the heat exchanger business so i think in generally its trending along with the economy so its not dramatic improvement but we are seeing some slight improvement in those areas samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co and if i can sneak one more in here im sorry just on the  versus  for ptc you commented that maintenance revenue is going to be growing really – for the software revenue is going to be growing im curious as a percentage of that  million what was it in  and what are you anticipating for  thank you raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so the revenue in  was – did we give a number its a relatively small number for  sam because we were literally just booking those contracts so the contracts will rampup over a year period and then will reach a steadystate so overall – weve given that number timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay overall this year –  you guys dont want me to be disclosing the details of the service agreements but what will happen is we have two three months service agreements to book were in the process of negotiating those so throughout the course of this year well reach a steady state on the service agreement so service agreements are fixed – basically fixed fees agreements with opportunities then for enhancement revenue which will be incremental so the fixed fee opportunity is  to  of our installed base that we talked about before and then what were trying to concentrate on now is were going to generate enhancement opportunities so theres upgrades and other things but data analytics and software enhancements productivity improvements or were speaking with the class is and then longer term comes the the focus on our product roadmap that i talked about and that focus really if you look at its out   years you know our focus is on fully automated railroads patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp it could be just a relative number we expect that particular line item of all the – if we add them all up to be theres – almost three four times what we were – three or four times than we accomplished in  so its significant yeah samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co got it thats super helpful guys ill hop back in queue thanks raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator there are no additional questions at this time this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to tim wesley for closing remarks timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay thanks kate thanks everybody for being on the call and we will talk to you in

listenonly mode please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to tim wesley vice president of investor relations please go ahead timothy r wesley  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you nicole good morning everybody welcome to our  fourth quarter earnings call let me introduce the other wabtec team members who are here with me al neupaver our executive chairman our president and ceo ray betler pat dugan our cfo and our corporate controller john mastalerz well have our prepared remarks and then of course be happy to take your questions certainly during the call we will make some forwardlooking statements and we just ask that you review todays press release for the appropriate disclaimers al go ahead albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you tim good morning everyone as you know  was a very challenging year for wabtec due to the recession in the freight rail market and sluggish conditions in many other industrial markets in this environment we are focused on controlling what we can and on investing in growth opportunities with that in mind  was also a year of tremendous accomplishments for wabtec i think well look back on it as the year that we took steps to position our company for a new era of growth and performance so lets talk about those accomplishments financially although we did not meet all of our  targets we did compile some of the best results in our history and generated significantly more cash from operations than net income operationally we reacted aggressively to our challenges by cutting cost strategically we acquired majority ownership of faiveley transport which has strengthened our diversified business model expanded our global footprint and added new products and technologies to our portfolio before i turn it over to ray id like to say a few words about the integration of faiveley and what it means to our company as most of you know we have been interested in acquiring faiveley for many years and we were finally able to come to an agreement in mid throughout  we spent countless hours dealing with regulators in the us and europe and we received the necessarily approvals to move forward in the fourth quarter on december  just  weeks ago we announced the purchase of faiveleys family stake and in late december we began a tender offer for the remaining public shares that process is ongoing and we hope to achieve our goal of at least  ownership in the first quarter of this year there is no doubt that faiveley represents the most strategic acquisition weve made to date and were very excited about the growth opportunities we can pursue together faiveleys strong position in the global transit market provides increased diversity of our revenue base across markets across product lines across geographies to offset the cyclicality of the us and global freight markets the company has a particularly strong platform of product and service capabilities in europe and asiapacific both of which are much larger markets than the us thanks in part to its geographic diversity faiveley generated organic sales growth of about  in  faiveley strengthens our innovation and technology initiatives and brings products that wabtec has not been able to offer such as highspeed brake for door and door systems and hvac equipment the company also brings a strong and experienced management team to complement our existing organization over half of faiveleys revenues are projectbased and backlogdriven which provides longterm stability and visibility and finally we believe the combination of wabtec and faiveley will result in significant synergies to drive our growth synergies and cost improvements we estimate synergies of about  million to  million in  and we expect longterm annual synergies of at least  million to be achieved by year three through revenue growth supply chain efficiencies operational excellence and cost savings and by leveraging our engineering and administrative capabilities here are just a few examples of synergies were working on sourcing combined we have spend of more than  billion annually which gives us leverage with suppliers by optimizing our product portfolio and new product development where we offer similar products we will select the best that each company has to offer in each geographic market and well eliminate redundant product development costs from an internal supply standpoint wabtec currently manufactures some products such as rubber and castings that faiveley purchased from outside suppliers now they will be buying from wabtec facility consolidations there are numerous opportunities for manufacturing and office consolidations for example faiveleys existing indian plant will be used to meet localization requirements for contracts that wabtec has won which means we do not have to invest in a new plant there a savings of more than  million in capital in all were tracking more than  synergy projects and seeing positive interaction and cultural integration among the teams so once again just  weeks into the integration process were pleased with the progress so far and excited with the longterm opportunities and benefits we expect to achieve id like to now turn over the presentation to ray raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks al id like to mention one more reason for our excitement two weeks ago we held our first annual leadership conference for the new wabtec we brought together the top business leaders in our company about half the participants this year were from faiveley it was very gratifying to see the two executive teams come together and focus on our conference theme stronger as one i think were off to a really good start our business leaders shared ideas for new products they shared best practices and disciplines such as quality and lean we discussed new acquisition targets and we explored cultural differences and ways to overcome them we have no illusions this integration will be complex but were committed to exceeding our synergy targets and to making wabtec a stronger company for all of our shareholders with that lets talk about the current state of our business in our markets so first well focus on fourth quarter  during the fourth quarter we not only purchased the majority ownership of faiveley but we started the tender offer process and began the integration of two other recent acquisitions workhorse rail and the gerken group we completed also a  million senior notes offering and we continued to manage through a challenging downturn in the freight market overall our financial performance in q did not live up to our expectations with sales of  million and adjusted eps of  there were several factors that affected our performance sales were about  million lower than we expected and product mix was unfavorable for example revenues from train control and signaling did not meet our sales targets we added sales of about  million from faiveley which were dilutive to operating margins integration costs and activities related to faiveley were significant and they did create distractions throughout our organization as usual we also booked some yearend adjustments none of which were significant individually on the positive side we did generate strong cash from operations of  million and our backlog increased  compared to the third quarter even excluding the faiveley backlog of  billion throughout  our management team responded to difficult market conditions with aggressive actions to reduce our costs these actions enabled us to maintain good adjusted margin performance for the year within  basis points of  despite an  drop in sales we reduced total plant employment by more than  during the year and we continue to adjust that as necessary going forward we made further cuts in discretionary spending at corporate and across all business units when we stepped up our efforts associated with the wabtec excellence program which includes lean supply chain initiatives and quality initiatives lets move to  guidance today we issued our guidance for the first time for the year we expect revenues to be about  billion with earnings per diluted share between  and  excluding restructuring and transaction charges and noncontrolling interest related to the faiveley acquisition the midpoint of the eps range represents growth of about  to  compared to  adjusted results due to the ramp up of projects already in the backlog and the timing of synergies from the faiveley acquisition we expect our adjusted eps in the first quarter of  to be similar to the adjusted eps in the fourth quarter of  and we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half accretion from faiveley will increase during the year as projects and synergies kick in other assumptions include the following revenue growth for the year will come from our transit group with the freight group expected to be down slightly faiveley will be accretive but its financial impact will be reduced by expenses for additional interest and a higher share count along with purchase price accounting charges were assuming foreign exchange headwinds of about  million at current rates our tax rate is expected to be about  for the year were assuming diluted shares outstanding of about  million for eps calculation purposes but our goals for  are straightforward to meet our financial plan to rightsize our business and remain disciplined when it comes to controlling cost to generate cash to invest in growth opportunities while strengthening our balance sheet and to ensure a smooth and effective integration process with faiveley to capture the synergies and the growth that we expect as in the past we strive to control what we can so lets talk about the freight rail market in nafta freight rail traffic was down about  in  in the first few weeks of this year the numbers are slightly better with traffic up about  on average were are not seeing yet any benefits from this as customer inventories of aftermarket parts remained lower than normal levels and equipment storage rates remain high if rail traffic continues to improve we do expect to see benefits in our aftermarket business later in this cycle perhaps in the second quarter or third quarter our  freight assumptions include the following railroad capex which declined about  in  is expected to be about the same in  locomotives will be down about  worldwide and about  in nafta freight car builds will be down about  worldwide and about  in nafta combined that represents a headwind of about  million in revenues we have opportunities to offset these headwinds because our growth strategies and diversified business model allow us to focus on the aftermarket in the us on international projects in places such as india on acquisitions that weve completed in  which will add incremental revenue of about  million those acquisitions include grahamwhite unitrac pride bodies and workhorse we also remain focused on increasing our global footprint and our product offering beyond our traditional nafta aftermarket because about  of our installed base for locomotives and freight cars are outside of the us our transit markets remain stable both in the us and abroad with good bidding activity overall reflecting this activity our transit backlog is at a record high for legacy wabtec business and faiveleys backlog is near record high over the next several years the strongest growth is expected to be in western europe germany france uk and asiapacific specifically india and australia while talk of infrastructurefocused spending in the us would also provide additional opportunities current projects include brake stores and hvac equipment for highspeed trains in germany brakes auxiliary power supply hvac couplers pantographs for regional and commuter trains in belgium brake stores electronics for the regional network trains in france and were bidding on significant future projects such as subsystem and component business maintenance for commuter trains in sydney australia as well as subsystems in commuter component projects for the new york city acquisition which is forthcoming in addition to sales growth we are focused on improving our margins in transit both in the legacy wabtec business and the faiveley business many of the synergy projects that al mentioned involve plans that we believe will drive significant margin improvements and were committed to delivering on those plans we continue to focus on growth and cash generation in  we generated  million of cash from operations which gives us ample capacity for investment our priorities for allocating free cash have not changed while we continue to strengthen our balance sheet first we would fund internal growth programs including product development and capex second we would focus on acquisitions where we have ample opportunity to deploy capital and third we would return money to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock buybacks in may we announced a dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for about  million or about  per share we have about  million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization we remain focused on increasing free cash flow by managing our costs by driving working capital down and by controlling capital expenditures our growth strategies remain the same they are global and international market expansion aftermarket expansion new product development and technologies and acquisitions so lets talk about each of these strategies on the global expansion side for the quarter sales outside the us were  million or  of our total were particularly excited about growth opportunities in india where we have orders for brake systems and event recorders for locomotives and faiveley has several orders for doors brakes and air conditioning equipment for various transit projects and bidding activity there continues to be strong in france after years of flat or declining volume the bidding activity is very strong including the largest commuter project ever in europe for rer regional fleet which includes  high capacity trains aftermarket expansion sales there for the quarter were  million or  of our total gerken one of the  acquisition companies recently won two multiyear contracts to supply its aftermarket carbon products in china and in germany and then on the new product side we introduced several new products last year we built a new plant in china to build intercoolers for the power generation market we introduced the new generation of sintered brake pads for highspeed rail we developed bogiemounted brakes specifically for the south african market and faiveley has a new neoflexx brake disc which theyve introduced to the market moving to train control and signaling control and signaling remains an important part of our longterm growth opportunities although its part of the reason why our freight revenues were down in  as you know our customers were working hard to implement ptc but decreases in freight rail traffic caused the railroads to reduce their capex budgets for both infrastructure and rolling stock in addition the deadline extension to at least  resulted in changes in their spending plans the result of all that are the revenues from train control and signaling decreased  in  to about  million we expect that to be flat to slightly up in  long term we expect ptc and signaling will be a growth business for wabtec based on the following opportunities multiyear of maintenance and service agreements which includes software and product enhancements international project opportunities and continued growth in signaling through organic investment and acquisitions in  we acquired a small but very strategic signaling company in the uk to allow us to focus on growth in that market were beginning to see evidence that our long term strategy is working weve signed several maintenance and service agreements related to train control including the year contract in brazil to provide a variety of train control and signaling services on the acquisition side our pipeline continues to be active and were pleased with the opportunities were reviewing in addition of faiveley during the fourth quarter we acquired workhorse rail which is a supplier of engineered freight components mainly for the aftermarket the company has annual sales of about  million workhorse supplies freight car couplers knuckles and related parts for a variety of class i railroad and freight car options workhorse offers a variety of product designs and sells primarily in the north american market that brings an excellent reputation and strong engineering capabilities in new products to our portfolio in addition we believe wabtecs geographical presence in aftermarket footprint will provide new opportunities to expand workhorse rails customer base in north america and around the world so with that id like to ask pat to talk a bit about some of the financial details patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay thank you ray so everybody im going to go through our normal review but also spend a little bit of time on the adjustments just to help everybody with their math and their models and understanding what actually was recorded in the fourth quarter and for the full year so sales for the fourth quarter were  million and when you compare this to a year ago quarter that includes a negative effect of about  million from changes in foreign exchange rates if you exclude that fx impact sales would have been about  lower than the last years quarter and this decrease can be attributed to the difficult market conditions in our freight segment our consolidated sales figure included about  million from revenue with a dilutive impact on eps including lower margins and higher interest costs when you look at our segments from a year ago the freight sales decreased about  thats mostly due to lower organic sales mainly from ptc from freight oe and aftermarket about a  million impact negative fx which is about  million which in those two items more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions which would have added about  million of revenue our transit segment sales increased  the acquisition of faiveley and others contributed about  million of revenue to the segment that more than offset lower organic sales of about  million and negative fx of about  million operating income for the quarter was  million and this included the following transaction expenses of about  million related to the faiveley acquisition some adjustments for contracts and restructuring expenses of about  million and if you exclude these expenses our operating income would have been about  million or about  of sales most of these expenses were included in sga in the quarter so thats the main reason why its so much higher than the yearago quarter going forward our run rate for sga is expected to be about  million our engineering expense was down slightly and our amortization was up mainly due to the faiveley acquisition so id like to repeat what ray said earlier that our adjusted operating margin for the year was  and thats less than  basis points lower than  despite the drop in sales thats a good performance in a difficult market looking at interest and other interest and other expense was  million in the fourth quarter and this included  million of debt refinancing expenses and additional interest costs incurred from the delay in closing the faiveley acquisition going forward we expect quarterly interest expense to be about  million but be assured we are focused on generating cash to reduce that number going forward interest sic income tax expense was actually a tax benefit in the quarter due to two items related to the faiveley acquisition first was an expense of about  million as certain transaction costs become nondeductible and we have to make an adjustment in our tax provision but then we also had income of  million reducing a deferred tax liability we had discussed the expense the  million expense with you in december the income from the reduction of the deferred tax liability occurred late in the fourth quarter after we had already completed the purchase of faiveley we were required to reduce the amount of the deferred tax liability that we had set up on the opening balance sheet because of changes in the statutory tax rate in france we expect the  annual effective rate to be about  and i always want to remind everybody thats an annual forecast the quarters will vary due to timing of any discrete items so focusing on the fourth quarter eps earnings per diluted share were  the effect of all the items that i had discussed and the  million noncontrolling interest expense related to the faiveley acquisition reduced eps by  so our adjusted eps is  so just to bridge you from the  to  we start at  of earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles you add back about  of transaction expense that would show mostly in our sga line about  million contract adjustments and restructuring expenses mostly recorded in the cost of sales line about  you add back additional interest and other expenses of about  and then we deduct the net tax benefit of the two adjustments that i referred to earlier thats about  and the minority interest about  and that gets you from  to  so going through same exercise for the full year our earnings per diluted share were  and the effect of all the items i discussed and the  million of noncontrolling interest related to the acquisition reduced eps by about  so our adjusted eps was  so again ill just bridge you from  to   is our generally accepted accounting principles number transaction expense and sga about  contract adjustments and restructuring costs  mostly in cost of sales additional interest and other expense about  the benefit of the net tax adjustments about  and the minority interest of about  that gets you to  okay to talk about our balance sheet it remains strong and it provides financial capacity and flexibility to invest in the growth opportunities we discussed earlier we have an investmentgrade rating for our credit rating and our goal is to maintain it our working capital at the end of the year included trade and unbilled receivables about  million inventories were  million and payables were about  million at the end of the year we had almost  million in cash mostly held outside the united states our debt balances at the end of the year our debt balance was about  billion and that consists of the following a  million bond offering that we had entered into in  due in   million of bonds that are due in  a bank term loan of  million and about  million outstanding on our revolver when you look at the balance sheet if you just do a simple calculation from our balance sheet at the year end our netdebttoebitda is about  times –  times im sorry but if you do a kind of a full pro forma its lower its below  times and then when you look at what we expect to do in  with our cash generation that we expect to be below  times so lots of strength on our balance sheet lots of capacity and helps reassure everybody that were going to maintain that investment grade rating cash from operations we generated about  million for the quarter and that brings to about  million for the year that exceeds our net income of  million so a strong performance and in line with our goals so just a couple of miscellaneous items we always review our depreciation was up  million compared to  million in last years quarter and for the full year we expect it to be about  million amortization expense was  million compared to  million in last years quarter and we expect it to be about  million for the year our capex for the quarter  million compared to  million a year ago and for the year about  million compared to  million in  in our budget and we always budget and tend to spend a little bit less than this but were budgeting right now for the combined organizations to be about  million for  looking at our backlog at december  our multiyear backlog was a record  billion including  billion from faiveley even if you exclude faiveley our backlog was up about  in the fourth quarter transit was  billion freight was  million changes in fx rates reduced the backlog by about  million compared to the end of  our rolling month backlog which is a subset of the multiyear backlog was about  billion transit was  billion and freight about  million the total backlog figures dont include about  million of pending orders and contract options we dont count them in the backlog until the customer exercises them so with that ill turn it back over to ray raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks pat so to summarize as al said at the beginning of our call we had to deal with some very difficult and challenging conditions in our freight and industrial markets in  but we stayed focused on controlling what we can while investing in growth opportunities we still face some of these challenges in  and well continue to attack our costs aggressively while driving our growth opportunities we expect to get back on track as a growth company here this year in  based on current market conditions and our existing strong backlog of projects were pleased with the faiveley acquisition and the progress were making on integration and synergy planning were confident that our diversified business model and balanced growth strategies will enable us to respond to both long term opportunities as well as short term challenges and with that well be happy to answer any of your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from justin long of stephens please go ahead justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi justin justin long  stephens inc so hi how are you so looking back on  obviously results missed expectations and i totally understand its been a tough demand environment to battle but especially with the month of december being so far below expectations could you just comment on your visibility and confidence in the outlook for  and as you do that im also curious if youve changed your methodology in terms of forecasting the business based on what we saw last year raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp the methodology has not changed we have a very detailed bottomsup methodology that we use for forecasting and were basically analyzing that on a weekbyweek basis to make sure that we have as a good visibility as possible justin i think the q results were disappointing we had issues that that we had to address some on our contracts we had a few contracts where we had to take contract adjustments and the freight business did not recover the electronics business did not recover we didnt expect it to but we were trying to negotiate some msas that we were hopeful would develop revenue opportunities sooner than they did so it was a host of issues that resulted in the shortfall i think on lot of those issues were one onetime unique issues that we addressed and we think that the forecast for  and the guidance is solid justin long  stephens inc okay great and maybe to build on that a little bit looking at the  guidance could you talk about what youre assuming for organic growth in the freight segment and also whats you are assuming for organic growth in the transit segment raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp and so were expecting overall as i said about  –  freight we expect to be basically flat to slightly down we will monitor very very closely obviously the aftermarket opportunity our opportunity in freight to a large extent its going to be dictated by how fast we start to derive benefits from traffic if traffic continues to pick up then again q – q we should start to see some of the benefits from that we know that on the oem side that car builds are going to be down we do anticipate some growth opportunities on the international side but overall we expect traffic to be down transit organic growth about  over the year is what we anticipate and if you analyze the backlog in transit both on wabtec and the legacy faiveley side its again basically a record high and we continue to pick up new orders the project – the good thing about the project business is it is pretty predictable and we anticipate improvements in revenue throughout the year justin long  stephens inc okay thats really helpful and i guess lastly when you look at the business just on an organic perspective what are you assuming for the change in operating margins in  do you think knowing the environment you just described from a top line perspective margins will improve patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp justin this is pat so i think what youre going to see just due to the way the year should progress that well get to about a  operating margin by the end of the year that is in line with what we discussed earlier clearly the overall margin is impacted by the higher mix of transit sales from faiveley acquisition so theres going to be a steady improvement in margin throughout the year we expect to execute on the synergies and the other integration plans and so well also see benefits from that too albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i might add that the one thing that you might ask you look at december and we had a pretty good view i just want to point out that because of the antitrust reasons we really did not have a good view of the faiveley business and how it would roll out during  we assumed a lot about an equal business across but the way they did a lot of completion on some projects in the fourth quarter and our faiveley business will really start out slow during the beginning of the year and these projects will start kicking in as the year goes on and theyre in the backlog theyre planned and a lot of these projects you do percentage completion type accounting so we have good visibility on this this is not like our freight business which is a component business that you have much better equalized sales but you dont have the visibility as much as we do and thats really the strength of this diversified business model and the strength of the faiveley acquisition and as pat points out these synergies they will build up as the year does and thats one of the reasons we said well start out slow and be stronger in the second half of the year justin long  stephens inc thats helpful al lastly pat i just want to clarify on the operating margin comment you said around  allin but would you be willing to share what the yearoveryear change is or what you expect in terms of the organic margin profile of the business patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah i think i would rather – lets just stick with the kind of the overall group the combined margin and because the organic growth i mean the organic margin i dont see that really changing but i think we need to do a little more in analysis to make sure that we have that for you justin long  stephens inc okay fair enough thanks for your time today operator our next question comes from sam eisner of goldman sachs please go ahead samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co yeah good morning everyone so just on the ptc asset here ptc was down and ptc and signaling i believe was down about a  million yearoveryear based on that  decline can you talk about which buckets between signaling and kind of core onboard electronic ptc how much of those were each declining and then is there any change in the mix expectations for your flat guidance for  raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so sam on ptc ptc hardware was down because capital spend was down so we anticipate that this year the class is will buy after remainder of the ptc hardware on the signaling side we had one of the reasons we missed q we had a pretty significant drop it was actually a delay a cancellation but its anticipated to come back in  a delay in one of the major projects it is associated with ptc but we were doing signaling construction on that project so it was for us the scope was signaling category so about  million of ptc last year out of the  million total train control and signaling was the revenue mix so the signaling really was pretty constant at about  million  to  and the drop was in the ptc part of it samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co got it thats helpful there and then where you called out these contracts adjustments and certainly it was a decent size headwind this quarter is there a way to get a final point on what specifically these contract adjustments are are there cost overruns that are going on are you taking lower margins on longer term contracts because i dont know there are issues with it i just wonder to have a better understanding of where these are being impacted which segment what specifically any kind of greater details that you can give us on that would be great raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah the contracts were really associated with the overall delivery performance problems sam theyre very different – there were three contracts that were in different industries and different geographical markets but for the most part they were associated with cost overruns unit due to supplier problems in two cases and basically late deliveries and all that samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co got it maybe just one last one are there any – you guys called out the synergies for  but are there any additional cost saving actions that we need to be mindful of i think this year there was pretty significant cost savings so is there anything else that we should be mindful of entering next year in order to get to you roughly a  ebit margins for the full year raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp were going to continue the initiatives that we had last year so well continue to try to proactively as much as possible adjust our discretionary spending so that includes all our expense items travel and the like head count things like that as well as the synergy programs so the synergy programs are very explicit we have over  dtl programs with people responsible to deliver on those programs we managed those on a daytoday basis but we have a unconsolidated meeting on a monthly basis so we have very good tracking mechanisms visibility and our focus is to accelerate those as much as possible look for additional opportunities to add to that portfolio and to deliver on the ones weve already defined and theyre across the board across the world across every business every business unit leader every functional leader has a target with specific projects associated with their responsibility samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co and ray just to follow up on that is there any number that you can put behind the  cost saving on the discretionary items thanks and ill hop back in queue raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp ill let pat chime in patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp ive got to say that thats a little – we get that question a bit i think the reality is that until we got to the fourth quarter and we had done a very good job of maintaining a margin with dropping revenue and so those costsaving initiatives in  really are reflected in that improved margin there was no one specific program initiative all we did was we were constantly focused on identifying variable costs related to the volume change but also being mindful of taking fixed cost out that would allow us to maintain that margin so going forward as ray said the real focus is on these synergies and integration opportunities we have and well continue to do the same thing with the changes in volume operator our next question comes from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead ivan yi  wolfe research llc good morning this is ivan yi on for scott group thanks for the time going to your patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi ivan ivan yi  wolfe research llc hey good morning can you provide a little bit more detail on your updated guidance you lowered your revenues by about  million from  billion to  million sic billion can you put that into which bucket is that in what product lines what segments is that all freight and then a similar question on the earnings guidance where thats also been lowered from your original preliminary guidance in december as well are you seeing higher expenses in certain cost bucket a little more color would be great raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay as far as the revenue job thats associated with a host of things its associated with the freight market certainly but also things like fx and other costrelated items as far as the second part of the question can you repeat it ivan yi  wolfe research llc yes just similarly are you seeing higher expenses in certain areas that prompted you to lower your earnings guidance from your preliminary projections in raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no were focused as we said on reducing expenses driving down our overall sga and our costs and continuing to improve our margins its really about all against reduced revenues that were trying to fight ivan yi  wolfe research llc got you okay secondly can you describe the current acquisition pipeline both in the us and internationally are certain markets a little more active than others and i just want to get a sense of what youre seeing out there in the marketplace raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp we have still a very healthy pipeline the pipeline is strong both in north america and internationally one of the benefits of the faiveley acquisition is they obviously have their own acquisition candidates so were now including those in our overall portfolios as we consider prioritizing acquisitions so we have both international as well as domestic and freight as well as transit ivan yi  wolfe research llc great thank you so much for your time raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator our next question comes from allison poliniak of wells fargo please go ahead allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi allison patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp good morning allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc i just want to go back on the positive train control and signaling comments i think you mentioned flat to up slightly obviously the biggest headwind was on the ptc side whats changed as we go heading towards the  deadline i would assume that would ramp up is there a piece whether its system design or something thats not coming back to where you thought it was just help me understand that a little bit raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i think for  theyre going to basically have to catch up in  and  and it has to be more loaded towards  because by the end of  the requirement is basically that all the equipment be installed and ready for commissioning so there is about  –  of the hardware that they still have to buy and we expect that most of that is going to get bought out this year relative to the signaling side a lot of infrastructure work has been completed but they did pull back significant on the infrastructure and then on top of that we have new opportunities that were booking for commuter lines and other railroads so there is some pickup in new business associated with new projects as well as the completion associated with the existing ptc procurements allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc okay i know the aftermarket piece is a bit new but it sounds like youre getting some maintenance agreements and so forth in there is it tracking where you thought it was a little bit more a little bit less any color there raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so there were delays a little bit allison honestly again another impact on last years revenue we were hoping to negotiate and close those earlier in the year it was a long protracted negotiation in most cases railroads are very good at what they do and we have most of the class is under contract now so those start off slow low and as the ptc implementation continues theyll ramp up and the contracts are negotiated basically at the level that we thought they would be we said  to  of the hardware oem equipment level and thats about where were going to end up it looks like were pretty happy with the way the negotiations went once they were finished allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc agree and then just last on faiveley are you –  i guess would a low tomidsingledigit organic growth assumption be the right way to look at it in terms of your visibility for this year for them raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp overall we think organic growth low to midsingle digits is about where we think well be allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc great thank you raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator our next question comes from saree boroditsky with deutsche bank please go ahead saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc thank you good morning could you provide some more color on the performance of the industrial business and then just how you are thinking about that into  raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp sure on the industrial business were not seeing any significant improvements in industrial its pretty much similar to freight were hopeful that that will change but at this point were not seeing any significant changes on the other hand we do have growth opportunities associated with industrial through the new product development and geographical extension that we talked about so that intercooler project represents growth we have businesses like industrial controls businesses in australia and other places in the world that serve the power distribution and power generation market so i think were forecasting a flat market for industrial similar to what we are at freight but there are improvement areas that will offset the continued depressed areas that you see in this country saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc thank you thats helpful and then just going back to the guidance is the implied ramp in earnings is that just due to faiveley projects and synergies or is there anything else that we should be thinking about raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no i think its a total mix of our business were going to continue to manage our improved profitability in all of our businesses as we always do that comes through our focus on cost improvement on lean on reduced cost support quality as well as the backlog thats associated with and the mix associated with freight and transit aftermarket business is strong working to grow the aftermarket business in both of those areas to more oem business you get in transit to more aftermarket business you have a  – year life so its a mix across the entire business that margin generation patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yes you are right i mean the two things are going to be the major factors is the project phasing that again we did not have the visibility of back in december and the second thing is as we generate the synergies through the year those are going to be the major contributors but as ray points out these arent the only two factors and we do have a tremendously diverse business model now that really provides us with the opportunity to deal with large headwinds think about the headwinds that were going to be faced with just fx and our headwinds from the freight business in the us both rail car and locomotive so i think that really speaks to the strength of our business model saree boroditsky  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats very helpful ill pass it on thank you raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay operator our next question comes from jason rodgers of great lakes review please go ahead jason a rodgers  great lakes review yes so i wonder if you could discuss what your expectations are for ecp in  raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp if youre referring to the regulation its being contested we dont anticipate that issue is going to get resolve jason this year but i think its going to continue to be debated and we havent forecasted any revenue associated with ecp in the us jason a rodgers  great lakes review right and how about the outlook for raw material cost are you seeing any beginnings of increases there raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so for our raw materials cost basically only about  of our total spend is associated with raw materials we have indexes under contracts for each of the raw materials copper aluminum steel et cetera some of the raw materials that are going up are offset by raw materials that are going down like rubber glass wood so bottom line is we feel pretty comfortable that were going to be able to manage any raw material inflation across our business for the year albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp but most importantly we had either indices or surcharges with our customers and we also have fixed pricing with our suppliers raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp and where were renegotiating those contracts to drive both fixed prices down frequently jason a rodgers  great lakes review and can you remind us what percent of your total sales are derived from freight oem currently albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp you mean freight car and locomotive oem jason a rodgers  great lakes review correct albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp less than  of the business is related to new freight cars and locomotives in north america jason a rodgers  great lakes review all right and then just final housekeeping question would you happen to have the shareholders equity balance in the quarter patrick d dugan  westinghouse air brake technologies corp sure so the shareholders equity at the end of the year is  jason a rodgers  great lakes review thanks very much raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator our next question comes from matt brooklier of longbow research please go ahead matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc hey thanks good morning so i had a question around faiveley synergies i believe the  million to  million of synergies you anticipate to capture this year thats up from your previous expectations maybe if you could just talk to whats changed why you believe youre going to be able to capture roughly i think twice the amount of synergies that youve formally anticipated in  albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp that number really is basically the same and its a gross number we still have costs that are associated with that and as we go through the year weve already had i cant tell you how many meetings weve had thats been concentrated on a program we have a full time individual thats devoted to it as we develop our synergy program maybe the next call ray and pat could provide a lot more color and visibility on it but right now this is the best we have is a gross number between  million and  million of synergies but i think someone i know – i think id mentioned that were tracking over  different projects right now matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay so the number hasnt changed its just the  million to  million of growth albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp no its the same matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc youre anticipating some theres cost offset that gets you back on to the i think its like a net  million to  million albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp exactly matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay that helps and then just broadly speaking of the  million of total targeted synergies could you talk to how much of that is related to cost and maybe how much of it is potentially related to some revenue synergies that you could capture with the combination of the business albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i think thats an excellent question because i think long term thats really where the synergy is is how we capture market share and grow our volume i mean thats the whole reason thats really the most profitable way to grow and were really focused on it there is some of that in the  million but you have to be realistic about the acquisitions and ability to do that we first have concentrated and focused on getting the integration get the teams culturally combined and focused on the right thing so that will probably not be something you would expect in  but beyond  and  it should start to grow and that really is our longterm synergy the main reason we keep saying this is the most strategic acquisition that wabtec has ever done matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay so just to clarify the majority of the  million at this point in time are more focused on the cost versus the sales synergy potential albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp i dont know how you define majority but yes most of them  addon cost and not on growth matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc im just trying to get the confidence level in terms of hitting that number albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc and then albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah ive always classified them as hard synergies and soft synergies and typically this revenue is a soft one matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay thats helpful and then do you – for fourth quarter do you have the breakout in terms of ptc revenue how much of it was freight and how much of it was transit albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp  was freight roughly matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay and then just lastly you talked about well actually ray mentioned i wanted to clarify something that at this point in time youve already signed the class i rails into contracts for ptc maintenance and services moving forward is that – did i hear that correctly raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah most of the class is are under contract yes matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay and the expectation is revenue from those contracts are expected to ramp as their systems go live so probably expecting kind of minimal contribution from those contracts in  is that a fair way to think about it raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yes thats right matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay thats helpful raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp theyll will ramp up to a steady state this year matt matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay and again just to clarify  to  of total revenue on – i guess on the equipment side of things for the class ones thats a fair way to think about the total annual maintenance and services to the revenue moving forward raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp so weve said  to  of our ptc hardware the installed base that is out there matthew s brooklier  longbow research llc okay thank you for the time raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks matt operator our next question is a followup question from sam eisner of goldman sachs please go ahead samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co hey sorry just a quick question here just on organic growth there were a bunch of numbers that were thrown around i thought pat you said  to  but then you also said flat to down on freight and up  transit so just help me kind of square what are you guys expecting for organic growth in  if you could put a number on it that would be great albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah yeah i think the confusion is around how much acquisitions play in that whether you include faiveley or not the overall volume is up tremendously but internal growth is low to singledigit growth samuel h eisner  goldman sachs  co all right thats helpful thanks very much albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp okay operator our next question comes from steve barger of keybanc capital markets please go ahead steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc hi thanks good morning i appreciate all the detail raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp hi steve steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc on the call so far i just wanted to ask one a little further out if you do look forward a few years to the point where the integration is well underway and we have say a stable to modestly growing freight market do you have a thought on what consolidated operating margin will look like given the new mix albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp the only thing i would say is if you take a – if you step back and you take a look at the faiveley business and weve identified in three years  million of synergies one could easily just add that to their current position and you would have an indication on what their margin might look like and i think pat the challenge would be the margin question about our base business even under the volume demand to maintain those margins as they have within that percent i think that long term we should be able to maintain our high margin business in the traditional wabtec businesses so that would give you an idea and thats just looking at it from  feet steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc understood so fair to say as you go towards the end of the decade that you would think theres a couple hundred basis points of improvement from the  full year that youre talking about right now is that timeframe realistic raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah yeah steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc all right thats all i had today thanks raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thanks steve operator our next question comes from kristine kubacki of clsa please go ahead kristine kubacki  clsa americas good morning guys a question a little bit longer term on the acquisition strategy now it sounded like and i get the complexity of this deal was the largest youve taken on and you made the comment about distraction it sounds like from a financial capability it is no problem to continue with the acquisition strategy but where were at with faiveley do you think that there is still bandwidth within management to continue at pretty aggressive acquisition strategy over the next couple of years given whats on the plate with faiveley still raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah i think kristine faiveley brought a tremendously strong management team with them stéphane rambaudmeasson has done an excellent job preacquisition to come to faiveley to address some performance issues and improvement opportunities and he was well along on a transition put in place a strong management team around him and those folks are a good part of the people that are running the transit business worldwide today so they have certainly their own relationship experiences and acquisition candidates that they brought with them and i personally have already participated in three different acquisition visits with folks from a faiveley legacy faiveley executive team so yeah theyre a fundamental part of our organization now we look at them as part of us we dont say they and we anymore and we have plenty of capacity probably more capacity than we had before definitely more reach albert j neupaver  westinghouse air brake technologies corp yeah and id add to that is what im think focuses is the integration and the synergy related to the acquisition and as ray mentioned in his prepared remarks he said were not having delusion that this is going to be a slam dunk easy acquisition so the question is a very valid one and one that we take serious and i think that when you look at where were at in the integration process on this from my years experience i think were kind of where we thought would be i think the biggest hurdle was still one of cultural integration and i think wed be careful in going ahead with a huge one although we have the capacity i think you worry about resource allocation you worry about attention to details but i dont think were years away from that i think were months away from that point kristine kubacki  clsa americas okay and thats very helpful thank you very much guys raymond t betler  westinghouse air brake technologies corp thank you operator it seems we have no other questions at this time so i would like to turn the conference back over to tim wesley for any closing remarks timothy r wesley

technologies nysewab or wabtec finally closed its acquisition of faiveley transport during the first quarter which provided a noticeable boost to revenue however earnings didnt track that increase since the deal added some restructuring and transaction expenses which when combined with weaker sales to freight customers caused earnings to slide that said despite continued freight weakness the

source westinghouse air brake technologies corp image source getty images what happened with wabtec this quarter  the faiveley transport transaction was the story this quarter thanks to the faiveley deal revenue within the companys transit group jumped  to  million which more than offset a  drop in freight group sales as a result of lower train control related equipment and service revenue and lower industry deliveries for new freight cars and locomotives in addition foreign exchange headwinds continued to impact results cutting  million off the top versus last years first quarter this year has been a busy one for wabtec on the strategic front not only did the company finally close the faiveley transport acquisition this quarter but it also acquired aero transportation which has  million in annual sales meanwhile the company signed a  million contract to provide signaling and communications services to a new commuter rail line in fort worth finally the company completed two additional acquisitions after the quarter closed buying thermal transfer and semvac which had annual sales of  million and  million respectively several factors impacted earnings during the quarter including weaker freight group sales in addition the company had  million in restructuring and transaction costs related to the faiveley deal which sliced  per share off the bottom line meanwhile interest expenses rose sharply as a result of the incremental debt needed to complete that transaction while the share count likewise increased due to that deal what management had to say  ceo raymond belter commented on the companys results by saying that our first quarter adjusted earnings were in line with expectations and we expect improvement during the year as we work to integrate faiveley and our other recent acquisitions we are managing our costs aggressively based on market conditions we continue to invest in our balanced growth strategies and expect to benefit from our diversified business model and rigorous application of the wabtec excellence program while belter notes that rail market conditions have been challenging there have been some green shoots of optimism in  railcar maker the greenbrier companies nysegbx for example recently reported expectationbeating fiscal secondquarter results furthermore greenbrier ceo william furman noted in the earnings release that we are encouraged by the upward trend in rail traffic order activity in our current quarter and earnings contribution from our activities in international markets meanwhile industrial giant ge nysege noted some positives in the rail market on its quarterly conference call ges cfo jeffrey bornstein stated on the call that domestic market dynamics were slightly more positive building on the modest improvement we saw in the fourth quarter however he did caution that although these signs of improvement are important theyre off a weak base and as of yet have not signaled a consistent trend the said ge did report robust orders in its transportation unit with equipment orders rocketing  thanks to  new locomotive orders including  in north america which was the first order of this type it has taken since  looking forward  given those positives in the market wabtec remains confident in its fullyear outlook the company continues to expect revenue of around  billion and earnings between  to  per share excluding restructuring and transaction expenses driving this outlook is the companys backlog which has several projects ramping up later this year as well as the expectation that it will
