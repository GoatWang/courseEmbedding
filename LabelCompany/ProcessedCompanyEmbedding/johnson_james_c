teeth are the result of a number of bad habits mainly smoking drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen however if your

your teeth and gums healthy they just may reduce your time spent in your dentists chairremember your angles when brushing your teeth always place the brush at a degree angle that way youre able to hit every surface of each toothdont forget the tongue within your mouth your tongue is the largest source of bacteria be sure to brush it front to back and dont forget the sidesfloss everyday brushing alone isnt enough to keep your mouth healthy and thats why flossing is so important each time you floss be sure to have at least  inches of floss available which is what you should go through if you use proper technique for optimal control hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingerswatch what you eat sugar alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus while some can prove beneficial too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gumskeep in mind the mouthwash though not a requirement mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains however dont overuse mouthwash as it can cause a number of ailmentshow to choose the right dentistproper oral care is an integral component of your greater wellbeing which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical historyfind a recommendation its important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with because thats difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book you should always seek out a recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may influence your choice is the dentists office nearby or do you have to drive out of your way is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule how much flexibility will the dentists staff offer in booking appointments though seemingly trivial these factors are nonetheless importantcheck with your state board one of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your states dental board dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet these organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentists background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actionspicking the right dental insuranceas with other forms of health care insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible however you dont want to simply buy the first such plan you see here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurancepick your plan there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall dental insurance plan instead most people purchase three main varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists
