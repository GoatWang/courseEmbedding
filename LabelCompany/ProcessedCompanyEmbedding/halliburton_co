object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

wasnt according to tim probert executive vice president of halliburton “halliburton as a service provider to the well owner is contractually bound to comply with the well owners instructions” it was

opened by the us justice department the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the pentagons inspector general these investigations found no wrongdoing within the contract award and execution process in one of greenhouses claims she said that military auditors caught halliburton overcharging the pentagon for fuel deliveries into iraq she also complained that defense secretary donald rumsfelds office took control of every aspect of halliburtons  billion iraqi oilinfrastructure contract greenhouse was later demoted for poor performance in her position greenhouses attorney michael kohn
