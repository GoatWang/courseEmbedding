property developer on the kenai peninsula during  and  he served as the speaker of the house surprising observers by winning that post gravel convinced former speaker warren a taylor to not try for the position against him by promising taylor chairmanship of the rules committee then reneged on the promise gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships as speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislatures committees and feuded with alaska state senate president robert j mcnealy gravel did not run for reelection in  instead choosing to run for alaskas seat in the us house of representatives losing in a primary to fourterm incumbent democrat ralph rivers by  votes and splitting the democratic party in the process rivers lost the general election that year to republican state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result in midnovember  the charges against stevens were subsequently dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct career after leaving

state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result

would come out in her favor gravel made clear he would not support or vote for either mccainpalin or obamabiden in the general election the following year gravel said that palins politics were terrible but that doesnt detract from the fact that shes a very talented person he predicted that palin would run for president in  and that shes going to surprise a lot of people palin did not run

chairmanships as speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislatures committees and feuded with alaska state senate president robert j mcnealy gravel did not run for reelection in  instead choosing to run for alaskas seat in the us house of representatives losing in a primary to fourterm incumbent democrat ralph rivers by  votes and splitting the democratic party in the process rivers lost the general election that year to republican state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result in midnovember  the charges against stevens were subsequently dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct career after leaving the senateedit a difficult transitionedit gravel took the  defeat hard recalling years later i had lost my career i lost my marriage i was in the doldrums for ten years after my defeat and nobody wanted to hire me for anything important i felt like i was worthless i didnt know what i could do by his own later description gravel had been a womanizer while in the senate and in december  he and

democratic nomination for president of the united states in the  election announcing his run in a speech to the national press club in washington dc short on campaign cash he took public transportation to get to his announcement gravel called for public financing of elections other principal gravel positions were the fairtax withdrawal of us troops from iraq within  days a single payer national health care system and term limits in particular he had opposed the iraq war from the beginning and in  gravel said that us troops in iraq as in vietnam had died in vain he also favored a regional peace initiative as well as reparation payments for iraqis gravel also called for a us corporate withdrawal from iraq with reconstruction contracts held by us companies to be turned over to

or less support by the end of march  gravels campaign had less than  in cash on hand against debts of nearly  because of his time in the senate gravel was invited to many of the early democratic presidential debates during the initial one at south carolina state university on april   he suggested a bill requiring the president to withdraw from iraq on pain of criminal penalties he also advocated positions such as opposing preemptive nuclear war he stated that the iraq war had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the war was lost the day that george bush invaded iraq on a fraudulent basis regarding his fellow candidates he said i got to tell you after standing up with them some of these people frighten me – they frighten me media stories said that gravel was responsible for much of whatever heat and flashpoints had taken place gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiplecandidate format the new york times media critic said that what gravel had done was steal a debate with outrageous curmudgeonly statements the internet was a benefit a youtube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than  times ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clipsnb  his name became the fifteenth most searchedfor in the blogosphere and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners hillary clinton barack obama or john edwards gravel appeared on the popular colbert report on television on may  and his campaign and career were profiled in national publications such as salon two wordless warholesque campaign videos rock and fire were released on youtube in late may and became hits and eventually gained over  and  views respectively rock in turn was given airtime during an episode of the daily show with jon stewart some thirtyfive years after he first achieved the national spotlight he had found it again gravels fundraising efforts for the first three quarters of  all this did not improve his performance in the polls a may  cnn poll showed him with less than  percent support among democrats gravel was in the next several debates in one case after cnn reversed a decision to exclude him gravel as with some of the other secondtier candidates did not get as much time as the leaders during the june   new hampshire debate which lasted two hours he was asked  questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and  seconds during the july   cnnyoutube presidential debate gravel responded to audience applause when he had complained of a lack of airtime and said thank you has it been fair thus far detractors began to liken him to the cranky uncle who lives in the attic or the angry old guy that just seemed to want to become angrier berkeley political

the january   democratic primary there beginning with the october   philadelphia event gravel was excluded from most of the debates with the debate sponsors or the democratic national committee saying gravels campaign had not met fundraising polling or local campaign organizational thresholds for the philadelphia exclusion gravel blamed corporate censorship on the part of sponsor owner and alleged militaryindustrial complex member general electric for his exclusion and mounted a countergathering and debate against a video screen a short distance away but he had lost his easiest publicity in reaction supporters organized mass donation days to try to help the campaign gain momentum and funds such as on december   the anniversary of the repeal of prohibition gravel did not compete in the initial  vote the iowa caucuses but was still subjected to a false report from msnbc that he had pulled out of the race afterward gravel did focus his attention on the second  vote the new hampshire primary there he received about  votes out of some  cast or  percent before taking time off to improve his health he resumed campaigning but fared no better in subsequent states by the end of january

continued to remain in the democratic race but additionally endorsed a green party candidate for president jesse johnson saying he wanted to help johnson prevail against green party rivals cynthia mckinney and ralph nader by late march gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten democratic primaries switch to libertarian partyedit on march   gravel announced that he would leave the democrats and join the libertarian party saying my libertarian views as well as my strong stance against war the military industrial complex and american imperialism seem not to be tolerated by democratic party elites who are out of touch with the average american elites that reject the empowerment of american citizens i offered to the democratic party at the

undiagnosed dyslexia – and was left back in third grade he completed elementary school in  and his class voted him most charming personality a summer job as a soda jerk led to gravel handing out campaign fliers for local candidates on behalf of his boss gravel was immediately impressed with the awesomeness of political office gravel then boarded at assumption preparatory school in worcester

avenue in downtown anchorage center opposite the anchorage westward now hilton anchorage hotel right the chugach mountains are in the distance gravel decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place and moved to prestatehood alaska in august  without funds or a job looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office alaskas voting age of  less than most other states  played a role in his decision as did its newness and cooler climate broke when he arrived he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the alaska railroad working the snowclearing train on the anchoragefairbanks run subsequently he opened a small real estate brokerage in anchorage the

the speaker of the house surprising observers by winning that post gravel convinced former speaker warren a taylor to not try for the position against him by promising taylor chairmanship of the rules committee then reneged on the promise gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships as speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislatures committees and feuded with alaska state senate president robert j mcnealy gravel did not run for reelection in  instead choosing to run for alaskas seat in the us house of representatives losing in a primary to fourterm incumbent democrat ralph rivers by  votes and splitting the democratic party in the process rivers lost the general election that year to republican state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it

that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his

terrible but that doesnt detract from the fact that shes a very talented person he predicted that palin would run for president in  and that shes going to surprise a lot of people palin did not run

democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs

subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result

corruption among alaskan republicans thought her national inexperience was an asset not a detriment and predicted that the troopergate investigation into whether she improperly fired a state official would come out in her favor gravel made clear he would not support or vote for either mccainpalin or obamabiden in the general election the following year gravel said that palins politics were terrible but that doesnt detract from the fact that shes a very talented person he predicted that palin would run for president in  and that shes going to surprise a lot of people palin did not run

representatives losing in a primary to fourterm incumbent democrat ralph rivers by  votes and splitting the democratic party in the process rivers lost the general election that year to republican state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result in midnovember  the charges against stevens were subsequently dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct career after leaving the senateedit a difficult transitionedit gravel took the  defeat hard

state senator howard wallace pollock following his defeat gravel returned to the real estate business in anchorage us senatoredit election to senate in edit in  he ran against the yearold incumbent democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result

would come out in her favor gravel made clear he would not support or vote for either mccainpalin or obamabiden in the general election the following year gravel said that palins politics were terrible but that doesnt detract from the fact that shes a very talented person he predicted that palin would run for president in  and that shes going to surprise a lot of people palin did not run

committee then reneged on the promise gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships as speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislatures committees and feuded with alaska state senate president robert j mcnealy gravel did not run for reelection in  instead choosing to run for alaskas seat in the us house of

democratic senator ernest gruening a popular former governor of the alaska territory who was considered one of the fathers of alaskas statehood for his partys nomination to the us senate gravels campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences he hired joseph napolitan the first selfdescribed political consultant in late  they spent over a year and a half planning a short nineday primary election campaign that featured the slogans alaska first and lets do something about the state were in the distribution of a collection of essays entitled jobs and more jobs and the creation of a halfhour wellproduced glamorized biographical film of gravel man for alaska the film was shown twice a day on every television station in alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of alaska native villages the heavy showings quickly reversed a –to– gruening lead in polls into a gravel lead gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his vietnam policy gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the gulf of tonkin resolution and his opposition to president lyndon b johnsons war policies was harming him among the democratic electorate according to gravel all i had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject and people would assume that i was to the right of ernest gruening when in point of fact i was to the left of him gravel beat gruening in the primary in a tight result with a margin of about  votes gruening found the unexpected defeat hard to take and thought that some aspects of his opponents biographical film had misled viewers in the general election gravel faced republican elmer e rasmuson a banker and former mayor of anchorage college students in the state implored gruening to run a writein campaign as an independent but legal battles prevented the senator from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left a late appearance by antiwar presidential candidate eugene mccarthy could not offset gruenings lack of funds and endorsements meanwhile gravel and rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies on november   gravel won the general election gaining  percent of the vote against  percent for rasmuson and  percent for gruening senate assignments and styleedit senator mike gravel when gravel joined the senate in january  he requested and received a seat on the interior and insular affairs committee which had direct relevance to alaskan issues he also got a spot on the public works committee which he held throughout his time in the senate finally he was a member of the select committee on small business in  he became chair of the public works committees subcommittee on public buildings and grounds then by  he was chair of its subcommittee on water resources then later its subcommittee on environmental pollution gravel was also initially named to the joint committee on congressional operations by  gravel was off the interior and insular affairs committee and the select small business committee and instead a member of the finance committee and by  was chair of that bodys subcommittee on energy and foundations by  he had also been on the ad hoc special committee to study secret and confidential government documents by his own admission gravel was too new and too abrasive to be effective in the senate by the usual means of senioritybased committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members gravel instead relied upon attentiongetting gestures to achieve what he wanted hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him as part of this he voted with southern democrats to keep the senate filibuster rule in place and accordingly supported russell long and robert byrd but opposed ted kennedy in senate leadership battles in retrospective assessment university of alaska anchorage history professor stephen haycox would say loose cannon is a good description of gravels senate career he was an offthewall guy and you werent really ever sure what he would do nuclear issues and the cold waredit in the late s and early s the us department of defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the spartan antiballistic missile two tests the milrow and cannikin tests were planned involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under amchitka island in alaska the milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five megaton cannikin test which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead gravel opposed the tests in congress before the milrow test took place in october  he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created he then made a personal appeal to president nixon to stop the test after milrow was conducted there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger cannikin test while the federation of american scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete in may  gravel sent a letter to us atomic energy commission hearings held in anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking eventually a group not involving gravel took the case to the us supreme court which declined to issue an injunction against it and the cannikin test took place as scheduled in november  gravel had failed to stop the tests notwithstanding his later claims during his  presidential campaignnb  nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the s and s gravel publicly opposed this policy besides the dangers of nuclear testing he was a vocal critic of the atomic energy commission which oversaw american nuclear efforts and of the powerful united states congress joint committee on atomic energy which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which gravel tried to circumvent in  gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents in  he was still proposing similar moratoriums by  gravel was allied with ralph naders organization in opposing nuclear power six months before us secretary of state henry kissingers secret mission to the peoples republic of china prc in july  gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with china including a proposal for unity talks between the prc and the republic of china taiwan regarding the chinese seat on the un security council gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition with four other senators in agreement during senate hearings in june  vietnam war the draft and the pentagon papersedit president richard nixon had campaigned in  on a promise to end the us military draft a decision endorsed by the february  report of the gates commission the existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of june  and the senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the vietnam war continued the nixon administration announced in february  that it wanted a twoyear extension to june  after which the draft would end army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a twoyear extension after which an allvolunteer force would be in place skeptics such as senate armed services committee chairman john stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a fouryear extension but the twoyear proposal is what went forward in congress by early may  gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation halting conscription and thereby bringing us involvement in the war to a rapid end by june  some democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a oneyear extension while others wanted to end it immediately gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter saying its a senseless war and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft a senate vote on june  indicated majority support for the twoyear extension on june  gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation the first filibuster attempt failed on june  when by three votes the senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since  protracted negotiations took place over house conference negotiations on the bill revolving in large part around senate majority leader mike mansfields eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from vietnam during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted on august  the nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the senate went on recess but gravel blocked stenniss attempt to limit debate and no vote was held finally on september   the senate invoked cloture over gravels second filibuster attempt by one vote and then passed the twoyear draft extension gravels attempts to stop the draft had failed notwithstanding gravels later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft taken at face value in some media reports during his  presidential campaignnb  meanwhile on june   the new york times began printing large portions of the pentagon papers the papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the vietnam war of which former defense department analyst daniel ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of congress – such as william fulbright george mcgovern charles mathias and pete mccloskey – about publishing the documents on the grounds that the speech or debate clause of the constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution but all had refused instead ellsberg gave the documents to the times the us justice department immediately tried to halt publication on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest within the next two weeks a federal court injunction halted publication in the times the washington post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents with some of them also being halted by injunctions and the whole matter went to the us supreme court for arguments looking for an alternate publication mechanism ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of congress read them and chose gravel based on the latters efforts against the draft gravel agreed where previously others had not ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to gravel on june  via an intermediary washington post editor ben bagdikian gravel used his counterintelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the mayflower hotel in the center of washington on the night of june   gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the senate as part of his filibuster against the draft but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed gravel instead convened a session of the buildings and grounds subcommittee that he chaired he got new york congressman john dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee he began reading from the papers with the press in attendance omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security and declaring it is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decisionmaking he read until  am until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll gravel ended the session by with no other senators present establishing unanimous consent to insert  pages of the papers into the congressional record of his subcommittee the following day the supreme courts new york times co v united states decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the times and others resumed in july  bantam books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the times had published gravel too wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record believing that immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war after being turned down by many commercial publishers on august  he reached agreement with beacon press the publishing arm of the unitarian universalist association of which gravel was a member announced on august  and published on october   this fourvolume relatively expensive set became the senator gravel edition which studies from cornell university and the annenberg center for communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the pentagon papers to be published the gravel edition was edited and annotated by noam chomsky and howard zinn and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war also edited by chomsky and zinn beacon press then was subjected to a fbi investigation an outgrowth of this was the gravel v united states court case which the us supreme court ruled upon in june  it held that the speech or debate clause did grant immunity to gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee did grant some immunity to gravels congressional aide but granted no immunity to beacon press in relation to their publishing the same papers the events of  changed gravel in the months following from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure he became a soughtafter speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers opportunities he welcomed as lectures were the one honest way a senator has to supplement his income the democratic candidates for the  presidential election sought out his endorsement in january  gravel did endorse maine senator ed muskie hoping his endorsement would help muskie with the partys left wing and in the ethnic frenchcanadian areas in first primary state new hampshire which muskie won but not strongly and his campaign faltered soon thereafter in april  gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the nixon administrations reliance on vietnamization by making reference to the secret national security study memorandum  document which stated it would take – years before the army of the republic of vietnam could defend south vietnam gravel made excerpts from the study public but his attempt to read nssm  into the congressional record was blocked by senators robert p griffin and william b saxbe run for vice president in edit gravel actively campaigned for the office of vice president of the united states during the  presidential election announcing on june   over a month before the  democratic national convention began that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention he was not alone in this effort as former governor of massachusetts endicott peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year likely presidential nominee george mcgovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vicepresidential candidates and letting the delegates choose at the conventions final day on july   presidential nominee mcgovern selected and announced senator thomas eagleton of missouri as his vicepresidential choice eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere gravel was nominated by bettye fahrenkamp the democratic national committeewoman from alaska he then seconded his own nomination breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination in any case he won  delegate votes coming in third behind eagleton and frances sissy farenthold of texas in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well for his efforts gravel attracted some attention famed writer norman mailer would say he provided considerable excitement and was goodlooking enough to have played leads in bfilms while rolling stone correspondent hunter s thompson said gravel probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing under different circumstances  yet the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the democrats the time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vicepresidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed mcgoverns speech until  am the haste with which eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention to be replaced by sargent shriver reelection to senate in edit c r lewis in  after eight years of representing anchorage in the alaska senate lewis won the republican nomination and challenged gravel in the  election several years earlier alaska politicians had speculated that gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues nonetheless in  gravel was reelected to the senate winning  percent of the vote against  percent for republican state senator c r lewis who was a national officer of the john birch society second termedit in september  gravel was named as one of several congressional advisers to the seventh special session of the united nations which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation in june  gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sexforvote arrangement congressional staff clerk elizabeth ray who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of representative wayne hays stated that in august  she had sex with gravel aboard a houseboat on the potomac river under the instruction of representative kenneth j gray her boss at the time gray allegedly wanted to secure gravels support for further funding for construction of the national visitor center in washington a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired another congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter but gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women both gravel and gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing decades later gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with ray but had not changed any votes because of it alaskan issuesedit by  gravel was urging construction of the muchargued transalaska pipeline addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipelines builders and operators should have total and absolute responsibility for any consequent environmental damage two years later the debate over the pipeline came to a crux with the new york times describing it as environmentalists in a holy war with the major oil companies in february  the us court of appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction gravel and fellow alaskan senator ted stevens reacted by urging congress to pass legislation overturning the courts decision environmentalists opposed to the pipeline such as the environmental defense fund and the sierra club then sought to use the recently passed national environmental policy act to their advantage gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law and thus speed its construction passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline on july   in a dramatic roll call vote the gravel amendment was approved as a – tie was broken in favor by vice president spiro agnew the actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily gravel had triumphed in opposition to the alaskan fishing industry gravel advocated american participation in the formation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea for two years he opposed legislation that established a mile  km exclusive economic zone for marine resources he was one of only  senators to vote against senate approval for the expanded zone in  saying it would undermine the us position in law of the sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would produce anarchy of the seas the legislation was passed and the united states has signed but never ratified the law of the sea treaty during his first year in the senate gravel urged abolition of the bureau of indian affairs in the early s gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between alaskan villages and the national institute of health in bethesda maryland for medical diagnostic communications gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first inuit circumpolar conference in  attended by inuit representatives from alaska canada and greenland these conferences now also include representatives from russia in  gravel helped lead an effort to have the us interior department rename mount mckinley to denali this eventually led to denali national park being so named subsequently gravel proposed a neverbuilt denali city development above the tokositna river near the mountain to consist of a giant teflon dome enclosing hotels golf courses condominiums and commercial buildings a key emotional issue in the state at the time was locking up alaska making reference to allocation of its vast mostly uninhabited land in  gravel blocked passage via procedural delays such as walking out of housesenate conference committee meetings of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy the bill would have put some of alaskas vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges the action would earn gravel the enmity of fellow alaska senator ted stevens in  a new lands bill came up for consideration that was less favorable to alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists it set aside  acres  km of alaskas  acres  km for national parks conservation areas and other restricted federal uses gravel blocked it as not ensuring enough future development in the state a new compromise version of the bill came forward which reduced the land set aside to  acres  km gravel in representation of alaskan interests tried to stop the bill including staging a filibuster the senate however voted cloture and then passed the bill frustrated gravel said the legislation denies alaska its rights as a state and denies the us crucial strategic resources and commented that the senate was a little bit like a tank of barracudas in  gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the general stock ownership corporation that became subchapter u of the tax code under the internal revenue code of  while that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed  alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to alaskan citizens for pipelinerelated revenue it also turned out to be significant in the development of binary economicsclarification needed loss of senate seat in edit main article united states senate election in alaska  in  gravel was challenged for the democratic partys nomination by state representative clark gruening the grandson of the man gravel had defeated in a primary  years earlier several factors made gravel vulnerable as an insurgent candidate in  gravel had never established a firm party base not liking to hunt or fish he was also always culturally suspect in the state a group of democrats including future governor steve cowper led the campaign against gravel with gravels actions in respect to the  and  alaskan lands bills a major issue especially given that the latters dénouement happened but a week before the primary the sources of gravels campaign funds some of which came from political action committees outside the state also became an issue in the contest another factor may have been alaskas blanket primary system of the time which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents republicans believed gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election gruening won the bitterly fought primary with about  percent of the vote to gravels  percent gravel would later concede that by the time of his defeat he had alienated almost every constituency in alaska gruening lost the general election to republican frank murkowski gravel was the last democrat to represent alaska in congress for  years until anchorage mayor mark begich defeated stevens by now an aged iconic figure who had just been convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts in a very close and protracted election result

the iraq war had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the war was lost the day that george bush invaded iraq on a fraudulent basis regarding his fellow candidates he said i got to tell you after standing up with them some of these people frighten me – they frighten me media stories said that gravel was responsible for much of whatever heat and flashpoints had taken place gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiplecandidate format the new york times media critic said that what gravel had done was steal a debate with outrageous curmudgeonly statements the internet was a benefit a youtube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than  times ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clipsnb  his name became the fifteenth most searchedfor in the blogosphere and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners hillary clinton barack obama or john edwards gravel appeared on the

youtube in late may and became hits and eventually gained over  and  views respectively rock in turn was given airtime during an episode of the daily show with jon stewart some thirtyfive years after he first achieved the national spotlight he had found it again gravels fundraising efforts for the first three quarters of  all this did not improve his performance in the polls a may  cnn poll showed him with less than  percent support among democrats gravel was in the next several debates in one case after cnn reversed a decision to exclude him gravel as with some of the other secondtier candidates did not get as much time as the leaders during the june   new hampshire debate which lasted two hours he was asked  questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and  seconds during the july   cnnyoutube presidential debate gravel responded to audience applause when he had complained of a lack of airtime and said thank you has it been fair thus far detractors began to liken him to

philadelphia event gravel was excluded from most of the debates with the debate sponsors or the democratic national committee saying gravels campaign had not met fundraising polling or local campaign organizational thresholds for the philadelphia exclusion gravel blamed corporate censorship on the part of sponsor owner and alleged militaryindustrial complex member general electric for his exclusion and mounted a countergathering and debate against a video screen a short distance away but he had lost his easiest publicity in reaction supporters organized mass donation days to try to help the campaign gain momentum and funds such as on december   the anniversary of the repeal of prohibition gravel did not compete in the initial  vote the iowa caucuses but was still subjected to a false report from msnbc that he had pulled out of the race afterward gravel did focus his attention on the second  vote the new hampshire primary there he received about  votes out of some  cast or

almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten democratic primaries switch to libertarian partyedit on march   gravel announced that he would leave the democrats and join the libertarian party saying my libertarian views as well as my strong stance against war the military industrial complex and american imperialism seem not to be tolerated by democratic party elites who are out of touch with the average american elites that reject the empowerment of american citizens i offered to the democratic party at the beginning of this presidential campaign with the national initiative for democracy the following day gravel entered the race for the  libertarian presidential nomination saying that he would have run as a thirdparty candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier democratic debates gravels initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued as a libertarian candidate gravel faced resistance to his liberal past and unorthodox positions nevertheless he garnered more support than he had as a democrat placing second and third in two april  straw polls in the may  balloting at the  libertarian national convention in denver gravel finished fourth out of eight candidates on the initial ballot with  votes out of a total  he trailed former

university in february  in june  gravel endorsed the nyc  ballot initiative saying the measure would create a citizens commission rather than a government commission with subpoena power against top us officials to make a true investigation as to what happened regarding the september   terrorist attacks gravel subsequently said that individuals in and out of government may certainly have participated with the obviously known perpetrators of this dastardly act suspicions abound over the analysis presented by government obviously an act that has triggered three wars afghan iraqi and the continuing war on terror should be extensively investigated which was not done and which the government avoids addressing in august  gravel was speaking to a crowd of supporters of sami alarian who two years earlier had pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison for a charge of conspiracy in helping palestinian islamic jihad a specially designated terrorist organization when he was caught on tape saying of alarians prosecutor find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time gravel was criticized for potentially involving the children of the prosecutor and alarians family disavowed the sentiments gravel defended alaska governor sarah palin after she was chosen as republican presidential nominee john mccains running mate in september  he praised palins record in standing up to corruption among alaskan republicans thought her national inexperience was an asset not a detriment and predicted that the troopergate investigation into whether she improperly fired a state official would come out in her favor gravel made clear he would not support or vote for either mccainpalin or obamabiden in the general election the following year gravel said that palins politics were terrible but that doesnt detract from the fact that shes a very talented person he predicted that palin would run for president in  and that shes going to surprise a lot of people palin did not run but gravels prediction about troopergate was accurate as palin was found not to have violated ethics laws from mid through october  gravel gave several lectures at south korean universities about the

united states close politics   pm et  updated dec   former senator mike gravel to run marijuana company by matt ferner k  former us sen mike gravel dalaska is the new ceo of a marijuana company that produces cannabisinfused products for both recreational and medical use the company announced tuesday the alaskan democrat and  presidential contender will lead kush a subsidiary owned by cannabis sativa inc former new mexico gov gary johnson serves as ceo of cannabis sativa and gravel is on that companys board of directors kush will develop and market new marijuanainfused products under gravels leadership the company said in a press release gravel served two terms in the senate from  to  and was a candidate in the  presidential race he also has been an outspoken supporter of marijuana legalization and a staunch critic of the decadeslong war on drugs i feel very deeply about the failure that is marijuana prohibition gravel told the huffington post as one of the reasons why he took his new job nixon is the one that put marijuana into a schedule i people forget that story i lived through that i thought it was horrible president richard nixon who is credited as the first president to declare a war on drugs signed the controlled substances act of  classifying marijuana as a schedule i substance though  states have declared medical cannabis is legal and four have approved recreational marijuana for adults the regulation and sale of the drug remains illegal under the csa the states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting statelegal marijuana operations where we have cannabis legal today is where the people have spoken gravel added the people know better than their leaders thats whats going on here gravel was quick to note that his new position at kush does not mean hes giving up politics it hasnt changed my whole political posturing gravel said ive been very active in the last month or so over the torture debate and ill continue to be active with respect to the difficulties that were having in iran in november prior to the release of the executive summary of the senate intelligence committees torture report detailing the horrors of the cias post  detention and interrogation program gravel urged sen mark udall dcolo to make the report public on the senate floor the move would have been similar to the one gravel himself made with the pentagon papers in  gravel began an epic filibuster where he read the pentagon papers first released by daniel ellsberg during a meeting of his senate buildings and grounds subcommittee  gravel was able to enter the remaining thousands of pages from the pentagon papers into the congressional record  thereby ensuring they would be public before the supreme court could rule on whether or not the controversial documents could be published in the press steve kubby chairman of the board at cannabis sativa called gravel a true american hero who brings invaluable perspective to the company “senator gravel stood up to nixon stood up to the pentagon and now he is standing up to those in power who would keep the healthful benefits of cannabis from those who need them kubby said in a statement kush vice president and coo michael pickens told huffpost that gravel has been a very active and outspoken member of the cannabis sativa board of directors i specifically requested to work with him for his track record of taking action and holding people accountable in government and now he gets to use those skills to advance another worthy project pickens said do you have information you want to share with huffpost here’s how also on huffpost politicians on pot
