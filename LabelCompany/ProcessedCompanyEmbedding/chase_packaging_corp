pride in providing the perfect most cost effective product packaging solution every time a blister package is one of the most popular methods to retail a product because it is visible behind a glossy covering and gives the consumer full view of your product while protecting it from dirt moisture and theft use the blister card as a “billboard” to communicate your message of the product’s use and features  choosing the correct size blister card allows you to describe your product in detail while attracting the consumer with colorful and “catchy” graphics our blister packaging options include face seal blister – a custom thermoformed pvc blister is heat sealed to the front of a blister card trap blister – where a the flange of the thermoformed blister is “trapped” between a front and a back blister card or between a fold over card  piece blister – this is also referred to as a clamshell package where there is a front blister that matches up with a rear blister capturing a graphic card and your product inbetween them the two halves can then be snapped together or sealed around the perimeter using rf technology to secure the package combination clamshell and blister – this is a hinged clamshell that encapsulates your product and then snaps closed but it has a flange around the perimeter of the clamshell that allows it to be heat sealed to a blister card this style is especially beneficial for a product that requires a “recloseable” feature in addition this option allows your product to be viewable from both sides of the blister card blister project features and design parameters to consider blister card size you always want your blister card to be as small as possible as it will play a “cost” role in the sealing part of the process smaller is always better but you need to balance that with the size of the product you are blistering making sure you leave the proper amount of card space for effective graphics on the front and back of the card which undoubtedly helps sell your product thickness or caliper of a standard style blister card is typically  points hang hole most every blister card has a die cut hang hole this is not an additional cost and is required by most retailers foot this is a protrusion of plastic specifically designed at the base of the pvc rigid blister that would allow your final blister package to stand vertical on a

can refer a local graphic artist if you need help with art development art can be supplied on a disk emailed to us or uploaded to our ftp site all art files should be in high resolution adobe

customers prefer  colors on the back of the blister card but this could double the price of the card final packout options once your product is blister packaged how do you want it packed into cartons that are shippable choices are master cartons shippers counter displays pop displays sidekick displays pdq displays or club pack displays we can help you determine the best option for your specific product timelines and leadtimes once you have selected a card size and your artwork is completed we will need a “production” sample of each of the products that will go into the blister package and we
