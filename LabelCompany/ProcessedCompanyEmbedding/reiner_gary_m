reiner gary read preview magazine article management review winning the race for new product development by reiner gary read preview article excerpt winning the race for new product development the old rules said the lowestcost supplier won to achieve lowcost businesses used a number of techniques including lowwaged countries focused factories technology and economies of scale the new game in town today however is speed to market why has the game changed for one thing shrinking product life cycles are forcing companies to develop products more quickly to keep up with market needs product life cycles are shorter thanks in part to improved design technologies such as computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing which speed up the development process more flexible components have also contributed to the trend by permitting easy variations on a theme such as semicustom microprocessors also aggressive smart mostly asian competitors have stepped up the pace by adopting powerful
