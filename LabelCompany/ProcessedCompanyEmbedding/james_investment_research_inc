techniques to create balanced portfolios customtailored to meet each individuals investment needs and risk tolerance our active management style bases asset allocation on our proprietary market risk indicators these indicators help us assess the general risk levels in the stock and bond markets we review them every week in the form of written market appraisals a longtime james tradition our appraisals give us a clearer picture of the markets long intermediate and shortterm risks armed with this knowledge we adjust either the stock bond or cash allocation of a balanced portfolio toward the area offering the least risk and the greatest potential reward since we do most of our research inhouse we have been able to create a unique topdown approach to generating wealth for our clients what begins with a broad investigation of overall economic trends such as interest rates and inflation funnels down to an indepth market risk assessment after this we make an allocation decision next we actively manage the equity and fixedincome portions of the portfolio this is how we strive to maximize return while minimizing risk james strategic asset allocation process james seeks to add value at every level of the portfolio management process this means we take an active management approach not only to equities in a balanced portfolio but to the bonds as well our fixed income investment philosophy is centered on preserving capital through interest rate anticipation and active duration management our market risk indicators help us to assess the direction of interest rates and to identify periods of risk in the fixed income markets we then target a portfolio duration according to individual risk tolerance you won’t find “exotics” “high risk derivatives” or junk bonds in jamesmanaged portfolios instead we focus on highquality bonds insured municipal bonds convertible bonds us government agency bonds and other high quality investments sticking with these more

different needs and risk tolerances and this is why weve created more investment choices by utilizing these styles either independently or in a customized blend we can help clients reach their financial goals why smallcap stocks it makes sense not only to diversify across asset classes by owning both stocks and bonds but also to diversify within your stock portfolio by owning small companies as well as large ones if youre looking for opportunities for higher returns on your investments consider smallcap stocks for at least a portion of your portfolio these small issues which we traditionally define as securities with market capitalizations at the time of purchase no larger than the stocks in the russell ® index  have historically provided higher returns than large stocks in studies by the market historians  ibbottson and associates going back  years small stocks have outperformed larger stocks in all time periods five years and longer the ups and downs of small stocks as you might expect these higher returns come at a price  greater volatility in the past  years small stocks have been subject to greater ups and downs than large stocks in fact generally small stocks have fallen more than larger stocks in periods where the market sp  index has fallen however history teaches us that for the longterm investor theres potential for great rewards when including smallcap stocks as part of an overall investment strategy in fact over the history of the stock market small stocks have outperformed large stocks on average by four percent on an annual basis however you may think that the risks associated with smallcap investing are too daunting the key question is how can investors achieve greater returns with acceptable levels of risk the answer by following a disciplined research approach james investment research has built a successful record in managing small stock portfolios by following a disciplined value approach to investing we use fundamental analysis as well as our vast computer resources to search for the top small companies our proprietary model is a tremendous tool in our search for smallcap stocks our model provides us a database of over  stocks to identify those with the strongest combination of value neglect and management confidence traits we then select from the best ranked stocks that meet our smallcap definition conversely stocks are sold from the portfolio if they substantially deteriorate in our ranking system are no longer undervalued or grow above our smallcap size definition to put our theories to the test james researchers have conducted a tenyear simulation which specifically measured the performance of smallcap value stocks selected by our screens in the simulation james stocks outperformed the russell

and author of  timeless principles of investing gives investors the tools to make savvy investments no matter the market conditions the following videos will guide you through how to be a better investor according to the principles barry has applied to his own investments previous chapter overview  timeless principles of investing next chapter introduction investing isnt gambling some people view the stock market as a casino others think of gambling as a form of investing neither is true so lets dispel the myths by highlighting the three major differences between investing and gambling the first principle know yourself what does knowing myself have to do with investing in a word everything at james investment research inc weve learned that truly successful investors achieve their goals based on their temperament even if it means they dont make the highest possible returns they match their investments to their comfort levels so they can stay with their choices for the long run putting the odds of success in their favor the second principle avoid losing money warren buffett one of the worlds wealthiest people has two oftquoted rules for investing the first is the opening quote of this chapter never lose money the second is never forget rule number one the third principle its not what you own  its when the goal of winning drove every decision legendary coach vince lombardi made for his team but for investors the goal is good timing the fourth principle hang on to winners sell losers how do you know which stock to sell first keep in mind that your remaining stocks should be the ones with the best potential for advancing second check with your financial or tax adviser about any tax consequences your sell decision could have after that your choice is simple but not necessarily easy whether to sell your biggest losers the fifth principle avoid following the crowd theres a concept in investing called a mania and its got a lot in common with its psychological roots its what happens when a large number of investors emotions cloud good solid reason the sixth principle diversify diversify diversify no matter how carefully you chose an investment disaster can strike sometimes it is literally as in the case of major hurricanes droughts or earthquakes sometimes it is political in nature markets can be rocked by coups government incentives or austere laws and regulations when you diversify you reduce your exposure to such risks the seventh principle let time work for you the final principle sums up all the rest having made smart diversified investments that fit your temperament its time to sit back and let your decisions play out over time how to apply the  principles complete five steps that will lead you to an investing style that matches your temperament and investing goals in conclusion as i close i ask you to consider one last investing principle it concerns what i think it is the greatest investment opportunity of all – eternity     james news march  a cautionary taleclick to read december  economic outlook click to read november  initial thoughts on the electionclick to read october  whitepaper  election

fixed income   homeabout usnews itemsmutual fundseconomic outlookcontact useducation   sign up for weekly market commentary fixed income the bond markets are one of the most important asset classes for many investors as well as for james investment research portfolio objectives such as liquidity and income often require fixed income exposure we are active fixed income managers that means we will adjust the risk profile of the bond portfolio to reflect what is happening in the economy this risk management is multidimensional james uses duration convexity credit rating and other important fixed income characteristics to build a bond portfolio that reflects the clients risk tolerance as well as hisher objectives and needs since each client is different each clients portfolio will also be unique james will use economies of scale whenever possible to keep transaction costs low also buying and selling in large blocks enables clients to get better prices in the competitive fixed income markets this is an important advantage of course a major function of a bond portfolio is to protect capital when the stock market is declining the transfer of assets from stocks to bonds in those difficult times and then back into stocks when the outlook for equities is brighter is referred to as strategic asset allocation this is the cornerstone of our balanced management style professionally managed bond portfolios have been a james hallmark for decades these portfolios are always invested in bonds and generally add growth to their list of objectives our statistical fixed income indicators revalidated every other year have been adding value to these client portfolios when rates rise as well as fall the value of careful research and professional management is very apparent in james fixed income style whether the client is an individual investor or a large institution james bond management is a powerful tool to help meet financial goals     james news march  a cautionary
