jefferson city mo ap photolg patterson lg patterson washington • former missouri gov matt blunt reiterated wednesday what his father us sen roy blunt has said in the past the two do not talk official business about the auto industry that matt blunt represents“i’m sure they will try to make it an issue” matt blunt said referring to democrats and his father’s possible  reelection campaign “but i don’t think it will be”indeed missouri democrats did just that on wednesday state party spokesman chris hayden issued a statement noting the relationship and declaring that “missouri’s middleclass families need a senator who will stand up to washington lobbyists when their needs are on the line” the relationship between matt blunt who has been the president of the american automotive policy council since  and sen blunt a republican has come into focus during the debate over whether president barack obama should have the ability to “fasttrack” trade agreements and a separate treaty being negotiated with  pacific rim nationsmatt blunt’s organization supports free trade but wants a crackdown on what it says is currency manipulation by competitor nations that hurts american automakerssen blunt voted for a currency manipulation crackdown amendment that failed  during the fasttrack trade debate last monthsen blunt said he was reflecting concerns of us automakers including ford and general motors whose plants support  jobs in missouri although the amendment failed it had bipartisan sponsorship from two senators also from carproducing states sens rob portman rohio and debbie stabenow dmichthe overall fasttrack bill passed the senate  with sens blunt and claire mccaskill dmo also voting yes she was one of  democrats to do so the bill now moves to the house of representativesmatt blunt said that because missouri has a significant autoproduction industry that anyone representing the state would have to take into account those interests he said that when he and his father are together “we have enough to talk about” other than the auto industry sen blunt said “i have pretty specific walls regarding anyone in my family that is involved in that or any other activity that there might be a specific vote on“but that certainly wouldn’t mean in the case of our state that i wouldn’t be talking directly to ford and general motors” sen blunt said “both have big plants in our state”stanley brand the former top lawyer for the house of representatives and a leading expert on ethics and lobbying said he believed that the fatherson relationship presents no problem in this case“absent a more direct conflict of interest like a direct financial benefit i don’t think this type of relationship constitutes the kind of conflict that would support recusal” he

serve as a great product for contouring on my ccc skin i used this to contour over a handful of times but was never quite satisfied with the way it looked on blunt made my face look somewhat muddy and dirty no matter how well i tried to blend it it also looked a bit unnatural due to the red undertones i had no idea this product had red undertones until i put it on my face lastly blunt seemed to fade on me after about  hours of wear it has been sitting in my makeup drawer untouched for about  months so i decided to try using it as an eyeshadow im happy to say that i love this as an eyeshadow i used in my crease and it looks lovely while i would not recommend using this as a blush or a contouring powder i will still give this a good rating because the pigmentation is wonderful i am glad that i was able to find another use for it report abuse  of  people found this helpful fatty on   pm more reviews by fatty age   under skin dry medium brown not sure hair black other other eyes brown the best blush to contour for medium skin tone its the perfect brown doesnt look too harsh and this product would last you for years report abuse lalalovee on   pm more reviews by lalalovee age  skin

eyes brown im nc  in mac i put this in quotes because everytime i try a foundation that looks like a color match there it has too much red in it for my yellow undertones when it oxidizes i look like a ommpa loompa it urks me how mac uses this nc as a catch all color for medium toned women because the undertone does not take into account the variations in this shade rangeok rant over and onto the reviewloli have tried this blush for contouring and finds it turns brownish red as soon as it hits my face i looks brown in the pan but i pick up red on the skin rather than throwing it out im gonna play around with it as an eyeshadow contour report abuse  of  people found this helpful paintinkchick on   pm more reviews by paintinkchick age  skin normal dark warm hair brown kinky coarse eyes green i pretty much use this like everyone else as one of my conture colored hmmdoes anyone use it as a blush as it is a nice matter as a pretty nature warmth to the skin once blended i think it would also make a nice crease color as well on deeper skin tones im nc  report abuse  of  people found this helpful purplecupcake on   am more reviews by purplecupcake age  skin combination fairmedium not sure hair black other other eyes brown very good bronzer for contouring im not too much into the contoured look but on the times when i did experiment with this product the look was beautiful use a light hand with this product due to high pigmentation and dark coloring report abuse  of  people found this helpful priss on   am more reviews by priss age  skin other fairmedium not sure hair black other other eyes hazel this is my hg contour blush it is too dark in my opinion to use as just a blush but great as a contour bronzer it is a matte dark brown but i use it lightly  it does wonders on my fair skin i use it all the time i contour my cheeks  nose then of course use a lighter blush  a highlight or sometimes i skip the blush  just use a highlight with it the color can be intimidating at first but a little goes a long way  if you know how to use it it can really slim down those cheeks report abuse  of  people found this helpful karlakimbo on   pm more reviews by karlakimbo age  skin dry fairmedium warm hair brunette curly fine eyes hazel on a look out for a good contour color for my skin  nc nc this made me look dirty andit would wash off in random spots say for instance i contour my cheek bones within  hours the contour close to my ear would fade  odd harmony is a better color but does the same wash away effect as blunt wamp wamp if youre looking to purchase this get  give me sun also by mac instead better contour color and doesnt wash off report abuse  of  people found this helpful mimi on   pm more reviews by mimi age  skin oily olive not sure hair brunette other other eyes brown im not sure what my mac color is don’t really use any of their foundationsconcealers but i would describe my skin as a medium olive with yellow undertones but definitely not tan by any means if you’re skin tone is similar to mine and you’re looking for a contouring powder mac’s blunt is most definitely not the way to go i originally purchased it as a contouring powder after watching a few reviews on youtube i’ve had it for more than a year and occasionally use simply because i have it the problem is that on my skin tone it a doesn’t look natural b is too copperyred and obvious to provide a “natural” looking contour c it’s difficult to blend d it’s too dark e it fades by the end of the day i have oily skin so that may be the reason bottom line it’s just too copperyred and dark to work well as a contour powder report abuse atrayloraxo on   pm more reviews by atrayloraxo age  skin combination olive not sure hair brunette other other eyes brown disappointed maybe its the lighting in nordstroms that convinced me to buy this i went to the mac counter for advice on contouring and product recommendations i specifically told the sales woman i have a difficult time with colors for contouring as i feel they are too dark and make me look muddy this blush matches that description hopefully nordstroms takes it back report abuse popular blush productscloud paint
