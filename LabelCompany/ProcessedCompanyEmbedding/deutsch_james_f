were one of the last to introduce this into there product and this cased them to fall behind with the tech side to there phone iphone  at this stage apple have took a massive leap with the design and software the fist massive change that apple did was the shape and feel of the phone they gave the phone a boxier feel with its flat sides with curved corners this was a massive change from it rounded

different ways that apple could go with there future products one of the things that i think apple will do is create a phone that is fully glass that is clear also ithink that the apple in time will bring a wearable product out this could be many things one of the many things is a watch that allows you to accesses all of you files that are on your phone with a watch another wearable product that i think appl will bring in is glasses that allow to take images of what you see also research all about your surroundings introductionwhy have i chosen applethe reason for me choosing apple for my presentation is that i use apple products in my day to day life so this means that i know a lot about apple products also i have chosen apple for my presentation because throughout the years of me using their products i have gained a wide range of information about there products where do people think apple is going next the first person that i asked said  apple has changed so much over the
