mission history team process representative clients process the heart of our process is indepth fundamental research as a firm we believe our core competency is individual stockpicking we place our active weights in a manner to derive alpha from stock selection as opposed to making large sector rotation or market timing bets the team of sector specialists is empowered to make their final stock selection decisions idea generation multifactor model after defining the universe of potential equity securities for each product based on market capitalization we utilize an internally developed multifactor model mfm which screens the initial universe of stocks in order to focus the sector specialists on potential investments that meet stringent valuation and profitability criteria the mfm identifies undervalued stocks based on valuation profitability and capital efficiency relative to the initial universe the output of the model ranks the universe of stocks according to their relative attractiveness  back to top fundamental research once the proprietary mfm identifies a stock that merits further consideration the sector specialists conduct due diligence on the company this sector focus allows each specialist to have very indepth knowledge of a specific area up and down the capitalization spectrum versus trying to evaluate multiple industries as many generalists do  back to top investment team review during the review of a sector specialist’s new idea the investment team draws from its years of experience to provide different opinions and insight regarding the specialist’s expectation of the company’s financial performance and potential profitability this review allows the sector specialist’s assumptions to be challenged from multiple angles and to hear ways in which another sector may impact the proposed company  back to top portfolio construction  trading once the investment team has vetted the idea the sector specialist instructs our trading team to take an initial position the objective of the trading team is to keep total implementation costs at a minimum while providing best execution  back to top monitor portfolio—risk control each product is overseen by a “team leader” who is responsible for monitoring current positions maintaining sector model and cash compliance and conducting monthly product reviews  back to top sell discipline we sell stocks if our multifactor model indicates that an acceptable tradeoff between valuation and profitability no longer exists if the sector specialist believes the company’s fundamentals are deteriorating or if the stock consistently underperforms its peer group click here to view process factsheet   adv – dghm – dalton greiner hartman maher  co llc home sitemap contact adv search this
