driven by the abnormal activation of kinases by identifying patients most likely to respond to our therapies we believe that we can increase the efficiency of drug development and the likelihood of

treatmentresistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors gist   phase  blueprint medicines   research clinical development phase  blu is a potent and selective inhibitor of pdgfrα dv and kit exon  mutants key drivers of metastatic and treatmentresistant gist and is being developed for these genomically defined subsets of gist patients gist is the most common form of sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract  the pdgfrα dv mutation is found in an estimated  percent of frontline unresectable or metastatic gist patients a patient population for which there is no approved medical therapy  for patients with kitdriven gist treatment with the currently approved therapies often leads to the emergence of kit exon  mutants and recurrence of disease in preclinical studies blu has demonstrated proofofconcept and significant antitumor activity including complete and sustained tumor regression in a preclinical treatmentresistant model of gist we have initiated a phase  clinical trial for blu for the treatment of patients with unresectable treatmentresistant gist and we are currently enrolling patients to learn more about this clinical trial please click here   phase  blueprint medicines blu for advanced systemic mastocytosis sm   phase  blueprint medicines   research clinical development phase  blu is a potent and selective inhibitor of pdgfrα dv and kit exon  mutants and is being developed as a highly targeted therapy for sm a disorder of the mast cells in which a kit exon  mutation is the primary driver of disease advanced forms of sm have significant morbidity related to symptoms from mast cell degranulation and shortened life expectancy due to multiorgan dysfunctionfailure from mast cell infiltration and tissue destruction  more than  percent of sm patients display the kit exon  dv mutation in their mast cells there is no effective approved targeted therapy for these patients in preclinical studies blu has demonstrated proofofconcept and resulted in significant disease control in a mouse mast cell tumor model we have initiated a phase  clinical trial for blu for treatment of patients with advanced sm including aggressive sm asm sm with associated clonal

initially develop for a genomically defined subset of hcc patients hcc is the most prevalent form of liver cancer and is the secondleading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide blu targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor  fgfr while sparing other members of the fgfr family and showing little to no inhibition of all other kinases aberrant signaling of fgfr is a key driver in up to  percent of hcc and blu has shown significant antitumor activity including complete and sustained tumor regression in preclinical models of hcc we have initiated a phase  clinical trial for blu for the

predicted resistant mutants   phase  blueprint medicines   research clinical development phase  our drug candidate blu is a potent and selective inhibitor of ret mutations fusions and predicted resistant mutants ret fusions are key drivers of multiple cancers including lung and thyroid cancer and our research suggests that ret also plays a key role in some colon and breast cancers by simultaneously targeting the primary driver and predicted resistant mutants that render cancer cells insensitive to treatment with currently approved drugs our goal is to provide more lasting clinical responses and prevent or delay recurrences of the disease in preclinical studies our compounds demonstrated tumor regression in disease models driven by the primary ret fusion and predicted resistance

and potent kinase therapies to dramatically improve the lives of patients with genomically defined diseases our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of the genetic blueprint of cancer and other diseases driven by the abnormal activation of kinases we believe our ability to identify novel drivers of disease coupled with our proprietary library of novel and diverse chemical compounds uniquely enables us to craft kinase therapies against new and difficulttodrug targets     we are boldly advancing a deep pipeline of highly targeted therapies against previously unaddressed drivers of disease by focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients we believe we can identify the people most likely to respond to our therapies resulting in a more efficient clinical development path with a greater likelihood of success and better outcomes for patients “by targeting genomic drivers of cancer and other diseases we believe we can get the right drugs to the right patients offering them meaningful and lasting responses to treatment” we see a substantial opportunity in kinase drug discovery and development to deliver breakthrough medicines that allow patients to live longer with better quality of life and prevent recurrences of disease kinases are involved in many hallmarks of tumor biology and are proven cancer drug targets currently approved drugs focus on less than  percent of known kinases and the function of most kinases is unknown led by a team of industry innovators with a track record of bringing lifechanging drugs to market we believe blueprint medicines
