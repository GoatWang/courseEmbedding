in boston massachusetts bay colony the son of maria née cotton and increase mather and grandson of both john cotton and richard mather all also prominent puritan ministers mather was named after his maternal grandfather john cotton he attended boston latin school where his name was posthumously added to its hall of fame and graduated from harvard in  at age  after completing his postgraduate work he joined his father as assistant pastor of bostons original north church not to be confused with the anglicanepiscopal old north church of paul revere fame in  mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church mather lived on hanover street boston – mather wrote more than  books and pamphlets and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in america he set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second and thirdgeneration puritans to return to the theological roots of puritanism whose parents had left england for the new england colonies of north america the most important of these was magnalia christi americana  which comprises seven distinct books many of which depict biographical and historical narrativescitation needed the mather tomb in copps hill cemetery mather was not known for writing in a neutral unbiased perspective many if not all of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons according to literary historian sacvan bercovitch few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did cotton mather none more clearly exemplified it explicitly or implicitly he projects himself everywhere in his writings in the most direct compensatory sense he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress he tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own his essays on the riches of christ to repay his benefactors his tracts on morality to convert his enemies his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child wife or friend mather influenced early american science in  he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant hybridization because of observations of corn varieties this observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend james petiver first my friend planted a row of indian corn that was coloured red and blue the rest of the field being planted with corn of the yellow which is the most usual color to the windward side this red and blue row so infected three or four whole rows as to communicate the same colour unto them and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth but to the leeward side no less than seven or eight rows had ye same colour communicated unto them and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off in november  mathers wife newborn twins and two yearold daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic he was twice widowed and only two of his  children survived him he died on the day after his th birthday and was buried on copps hill near old north church boyles influence on matheredit robert boyle was a huge influence throughout mathers career he read boyles the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy closely throughout the s and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it using almost identical language to boylepage needed increase matheredit mathers relationship with his father increase mather is thought by some to have been strained and difficult increase was a pastor of the north square church and president of harvard college he led an accomplished life despite cottons efforts he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father he did surpass his fathers output as a writer writing more than  books one of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials which increase mather reportedly did not support yale collegeedit cotton mather helped convince elihu yale to make a donation to a new college in new haven which became yale college salem witch trials of  the mather influenceedit pretrialsedit in  mather published memorable providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the goodwin family in boston catholic washerwoman goody glover was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case mather had a prominent role in this case besides praying for the children which also included fasting and meditation he would also observe and record their activities the children were subject to hysterical fits which he detailed in memorable providences in his book mather argued that since there are witches and devils there are immortal souls he also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves he opposed any natural explainations for the fits he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil and he argued that spectral evidence should not be used as evidence for witchcraft robert calef was a contemporary of mather and critical of him and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the salem witch trials three years later mr cotton mather was the most active and forward of any minister in the country in those matters taking home one of the children and managing such intreagues with that child and after printing such an account of the whole in his memorable providences as conduced much to the kindling of those flames that in sir williams time threatened the devouring of this country nineteenthcentury historian charles wentworth upham shared the view that the afflicted in salem were imitating the goodwin children but he put the blame on both cotton and his father increase mather they are answerable more than almost any other men have been for the opinions of their time it was indeed a superstitious age but made much more so by their operations influence and writings beginning with increase mathers movement at the assembly of ministers in  and ending with cotton mathers dealings with the goodwin children and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide for this reason then in the first place i hold those two men responsible for what is called salem witchcraft the courtedit mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning sir william phips governor of the newly chartered province of massachusetts bay appointed his lieutenant governor william stoughton as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts where he presided over the witch trials according to george bancroft mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under phips through the intervention of mathers own politically powerful father increase intercession had been made by cotton mather for the advancement of stoughton a man of cold affections proud selfwilled and covetous of distinction apparently mather saw in stoughton a bachelor who had never wed an ally for churchrelated matters bancroft quotes mathers reaction to stoughtons appointment as follows the time for a favor is come exulted cotton mather yea the set time is come mather claimed not to have attended the trials in salem although his father attended the trial of george burroughs his contemporaries calef and thomas brattle place him at the executions see below mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end if in the midst of the many dissatisfaction among us the publication of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto god for justice being so far executed among us i shall rejoyce that god is glorified mather called himself a historian not an advocate but according to one modern writer his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling martha carrier a rampant hag mather referred to george burroughs as a very puny man whose tergiversations contradictions and falsehoods made his testimony not worth consideringpage needed use of spectral evidenceedit mathers most significant influence over the trials was in composing the answer to the question of whether or not to allow spectral evidence the afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant invisible to any but themselves was tormenting them this was considered evidence of witchcraft despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held christian beliefs an opinion on the matter was sought from the most esteemed ministers of the area and mather took credit for their response when anonymously celebrating himself years later drawn up at their desire by cotton mather the younger as i have been informedpage needed on may   mather wrote to one of the judges john richards a member of his congregationpage needed expressing his support of the prosecutions but cautioning do not lay more stress on pure spectral evidence than it will bear  it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also very virtuous though i believe that the just god then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused thomas hutchinson summarized the letter the two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before reprinting the letter years later in magnalia mather notably omitted the fateful two first and the last sections the original full version of the letter called return of the several ministers was dated june   and had been reprinted in late  in the final two pages of increase mathers cases of conscience it is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument calef calls it perfectly ambidexter giving as great as greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods then cautions against them indeed the advice then given looks most like a thing of his composing as carrying both fire to increase and water to quench the conflagration regarding spectral evidence upham concludes that cotton mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it never advised its absolute exclusion but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption  and once admitted nothing could stand against it character reason common sense were swept away in a letter to an english clergyman in  boston intellectual thomas brattle criticizing the trials said of the judges use of spectral evidence the sg salem gentlemen will by no means allow that any are brought in guilty and condemned by virtue of spectre evidence but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences that these persons are found guilty considering what before has been said i leave you and any man of sense to judge and determine the later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by governor phips around the same time his own wife lady mary phipss name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft began in january  this immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions due to a reprieve by phips there were no further executions phipss actions were vigorously opposed by william stoughton bancroft notes that mather considered witches among the poor and vile and ragged beggars upon earth and bancroft asserts that mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates calef places mather at the scene of the execution of george burroughs and four others who were executed after mather spoke and shows him playing a direct and influential role mr buroughs sic was carried in a cart with others through the streets of salem to execution when he was upon the ladder he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present his prayer which he concluded by repeating the lords prayer as witches were not supposed to be able to recite was so well worded and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit as was very affecting and drew tears from many so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution the accusers said the black man devil stood and dictated to him as soon as he was turned off hanged mr cotton mather being mounted upon a horse addressed himself to the people partly to declare that he mr burroughs was no ordained minister partly to possess the people of his guilt saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light and this did somewhat appease the people and the executions went on when he mr burroughs was cut down he was dragged by a halter to a hole or grave between the rocks about two feet deep his shirt and breeches being pulled off and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts he was so put in together with john willard and martha carrier that one of his hands and his chin and a foot of one of them was left uncovered posttrialsedit in the years after the trials of the principal actors in the trial whose lives are recorded after neither he nor stoughton ever admitted to any misgivings in the years after the trials he became an increasingly vehement defender of them at the request of then ltgov stoughton mather wrote wonders of the invisible world during the trials which were published in  the book contained a few of mathers sermons the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in europe he somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in return of the several ministers by defending the use of spectral evidence wonders of the invisible world appeared at the same time as increase mathers cases of conscience mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially oct th  cm letter to his uncle there are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press containing cases of conscience about witchcraft i did in my conscience think that as the humors of this people now run such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witchadvocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches considered in parcels while things as they lay in bulk with their whole dependencies were not exposed but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice  more than so produce a public  open contest with the judges who would tho beyond the intention of the worthy author  subscribers find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile mob — october   letter to his uncle john cotton the last event in mathers involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure mercy short and margaret rule boston merchant robert calef began his eightyear campaign against the influential mathers calefs book was inspired by the fear that mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of  he quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges upon reading calefs more wonders of the invisible world increase mather cottons father publicly burned the book in harvard yard poole vs uphamedit in  william frederick poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on cotton mathers role in the witch trials if anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking who got up salem witchcraft he will reply cotton mather let him try another boy who was cotton mather and the answer will come the man who was on horseback and hung witches poole was a librarian and a lover of literature including mathers magnalia and other books and tracts numbering nearly  which were never so prized by collectors as today poole announced his intention to redeem mathers name using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by charles wentworth upham salem witchcraft volumes i and ii with an account of salem village and a history of opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects which runs to almost  pages and a quick search of the name mather referring to either father son or ancestors shows that it occurs  times pooles critique in book form runs less than  pages but the name mather occurs many more times than the other book which is more than ten times as long upham shows a balanced and complicated view of cotton mather such as this first mention one of cotton mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master it flows from a heart warm with gratitude uphams book refers to robert calef no fewer than  times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by calef in the mids and stating although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions there is no ground to dispute the veracity of calef as to matters of fact he goes on to say that calefs collection of writings gave a shock to mathers influence from which it never recoveredcitation needed calef produced only the one book he is selfeffacing and apologetic for his limitations and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector poole champion of literature cannot accept calef whose faculties as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order and his book in our opinion has a reputation much beyond its merits poole refers to calef as mathers personal enemy and opens a line without discussing the character and motives of calef but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn calef upham responded to poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title referring to poole as the reviewer many of pooles arguments were addressed but both authors emphasize the importance of cotton mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence as copied in the final pages called the return of several ministers of increase mathers cases of conscience in  historian george lincoln burr sided with upham in a note on thomas brattles letter the strange suggestion of w f poole that brattle here means cotton mather himself is adequately answered by upham burr reprinted calef in full and dug deep into the historical record for information on the man and concludes that he had else any grievance against the mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think burr finds that a comparison between calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactnesscitation needed mather revivalists th century revisionedit since the poole vs upham debate several scholars have rexamined mathers reputation and his role in the witchcraft trials  cotton mather the puritan priest by barret wendall an english professor at harvard university wendall played a leading role in the mather revival but he might have been surprised to see how far the wheel turned his book often expresses agreement with upham and unlike poole he simply announces his intention to show cotton mather in a more positive light “cotton mather gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other” and some pages later “robert calef’s temper was that of the rational eighteenth century the mathers belonged rather to the sixteenth the age of passionate religious enthusiasm”  life and times of cotton mather by rev abijah p marvin published by congregational sunday school and publishing society this work tends to paraphrase cotton mather’s artfully constructed diary marvin presents a lengthy critique of robert calef  increase mather the foremost american puritan by kenneth b murdock harvard university press murdock studied under wendall and is also critical of cotton mather but in a strong desire to show increase mather in a positive light he omits much  cotton mather a bibliography by tj holmes harvard university press holmes was librarian at the william g mather library his notes are pugilistic and promather but holmes published for the first time cotton mather’s october   letter see above to his uncle opposing an end to the trials  the devil in massachusetts a modern inquiry into the salem witch trials by marion l starkey she feels that mather was not as active in the salem trials as others give him credit for she does bring up that mather did denounce torture as a way to get a confession and cautioned against the use of spectral evidence  the intellectual life of colonial new england by samuel eliot morison morison believes that mather found balance and levelthinking during the witchcraft trials he also believes that calef had an agenda against mather which stuck with him over time  selected letters of cotton mather by ken silverman louisiana state university press on page  silverman writes “actually mather had very little to do with the trials” twelve pages later he publishes for the first time to chief judge william stoughton on september   in which cotton mather writes “ i hope i can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen” and continues “i have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance”  the admirable cotton mather by james playsted wood a young adult book in the preface wood writes that a “changed attitude” began with wendall above and passed to murdock above and another colleague in the harvard english department lyman kittredge the intricate relationship of the mathers to harvard with a revisionist movement emerging from the same institution can at times give an uncomfortable aspect of history being bent to team spiritcitation needed ongoing revisionedit chadwick hansens witchcraft at salem published in  presents mather as a positive influence on the salem trials he considered mathers handling of the goodwin children to be sane and temperate that he was more concerned with helping the afflicted than witchhunting and treated the children with prayer and fasting hansen wrote that mather was a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed — or feigned confession — such as tituba and dorcas good and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in wonders of the invisible world after some others had lamented the roles they played in the executions and imprisonments mather and stoughton remained the chief defenders of the trials which diminishes the view of him as a moderate influence historian larry gregg highlights mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when mather stated the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also the very virtuous writing in the early s historian john demos imputed to mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials smallpox inoculation controversyedit the practice of smallpox inoculation as opposed to the later practice of vaccination was developed possibly in thcentury india or thcentury china spreading its reach in seventeenthcentury turkey inoculation or rather variolation involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox variola to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity by the beginning of the th century the royal society in england was discussing the practice of inoculation and the smallpox epidemic in  spurred further interest it was not until  however that england recorded its first case of inoculation early new englandedit smallpox was a serious threat in colonial america most devastating to native americans but also to angloamerican settlers new england suffered smallpox epidemics in  – and  it was highly contagious and mortality could reach as high as  percent boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in  and  during this era public authorities in massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine incoming ships were quarantined in boston harbor and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse in  mathers slave onesimus explained to mather how he had been inoculated as a child in africa mather was fascinated by the idea by july  he had read an endorsement of inoculation by dr emanuel timonius of constantinople in the philosophical transactions mather then declared in a letter to dr john woodward of gresham college in london that he planned to press bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again by  a whole generation of young bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared on april  of that year the hms seahorse arrived from the west indies carrying smallpox on board despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine eight known cases of smallpox appeared in boston by may  and by midjune the disease was spreading at an alarming rate as a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread many residents fled to outlying rural settlements the combination of exodus quarantine and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the bay colony for weeks guards were stationed at the house of representatives to keep bostonians from entering without special permission the death toll reached  in september and the selectmen powerless to stop it severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll as one response legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who under these conditions could no longer support their familiescitation needed on june   mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by timonius and jacobus pylarinus to local physicians urging them to consult about the matter he received no response next mather pleaded his case to dr zabdiel boylston who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves — one grown and one a boy all recovered in about a week boylston inoculated seven more people by midjuly the epidemic peaked in october  with  deaths by february   boston was again free from smallpox the total number of cases since april  came to  with  deaths—more than threequarters of all the deaths in boston during  meanwhile boylston had inoculated  people with six resulting deaths inoculation debateedit boylston and mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid clamour among the people of boston both boylston and mather were objects of their fury their furious obloquies and invectives which mather acknowledges in his diary bostons selectmen consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection forbade boylston from performing it again the newengland courant published writers who opposed the practice the editorial stance was that the boston populace feared that inoculation spread rather than prevented the disease however some historians notably h w brands have argued that this position was a result of the contrarian positions of editorinchief james franklin a brother of benjamin franklin public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by reverend john williams from boston who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of physick either natural or divine and therefore unlawful to those put forth in a pamphlet by dr william douglass of boston entitled the abuses and scandals of some late pamphlets in favour of inoculation of the small pox  on the qualifications of inoculations proponents douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from europe at the extreme in november  someone hurled a lighted grenade into mathers home medical oppositionedit several opponents of smallpox inoculation among them rev john williams stated that there were only two laws of physick medicine sympathy and antipathy in his estimation inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease or an antipathy toward one but the creation of one for this reason its practice violated the natural laws of medicine transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal as with most colonists williams puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life and he used the bible to state his case he quoted matthew  when jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick dr william douglass proposed a more secular argument against inoculation stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices in addition he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise according to douglass smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence one not to be undertaken lightly he believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony including that of caring for the sick they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented the only reason mather had had success in it he said was because mather had used it on children who are naturally more resilient douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection speak out he did the battle between these two prestigious adversaries douglass and mather lasted far longer than the epidemic itself and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous puritan resistanceedit generally puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments increase mather cottons father was joined by prominent pastors benjamin colman and william cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations one of the classic assumptions of the puritan mind was that the will of god was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation nevertheless williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of god and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most high he also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by god as punishment for sin and warned that attempting to shield themselves from gods fury via inoculation would only serve to provoke him more puritans found meaning in affliction and they did not yet know why god was showing them disfavor through smallpox not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand many puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art they grappled with adhering to the ten commandments with being proper church members and good caring neighbors the apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the sixth commandment – thou shalt not kill — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the bible it was not the will of god and therefore unlawful he explained that inoculation violated the golden rule because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him with the bible as the puritans source for all decisionmaking lack of scriptural evidence concerned many and williams vocally scorned mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the bible inoculation defendededit with the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day the use of quarantine and various other efforts such as balancing the bodys humors did not slow the spread of the disease as news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people by circa  smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the atlantic world mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of god and argued the procedure was not outside of puritan principles he wrote that whether a christian may not employ this medicine let the matter of it be what it will and humbly give thanks to gods good providence in discovering of it to a miserable world and humbly look up to his good providence as we do in the use of any other medicine it may seem strange that any wise christian cannot answer it and how strangely do men that call themselves physicians betray their anatomy and their philosophy as well as their divinity in their invectives against this practice the puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone both the good and the wicked yet god had provided them with the means to save themselves mather reported that from his view none that have used it ever died of the small pox tho at the same time it were so malignant that at least half the people died that were infected with it in the common way while mather was experimenting with the procedure prominent puritan pastors benjamin colman and william cooper expressed public and theological support for them the practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to firsthand experiences and personal relationships although many were initially wary of the concept it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results within their own community of ordinary citizens that it became widely utilized and supported one important change in the practice after  was regulated quarantine of innoculees the aftermathedit although mather and boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of – after overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success

opinions on the bible and how he interpreted it biblia americana is incredibly large and mather worked on it from  until  when he died mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could

prominent puritan ministers mather was named after his maternal grandfather john cotton he attended boston latin school where his name was posthumously added to its hall of fame and graduated from harvard in  at age  after completing his postgraduate work he joined his father as assistant pastor of bostons original north church not to be confused with the anglicanepiscopal old north church of paul revere fame in  mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church mather lived on hanover street boston – mather wrote more than  books and pamphlets and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in america he set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second and thirdgeneration puritans to return to the theological roots of puritanism whose parents had left england for the new england colonies of north america the most important of these was magnalia christi americana  which comprises seven distinct books many of which depict biographical and historical narrativescitation needed the mather tomb in copps hill cemetery mather was not known for writing in a neutral unbiased perspective many if not all of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons according to literary historian sacvan bercovitch few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did cotton mather none more clearly exemplified it explicitly or implicitly he projects himself everywhere in his writings in the most direct compensatory sense he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress he tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own his essays on the riches of christ to repay his benefactors his tracts on morality to convert his enemies his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child wife or friend mather influenced early american science in  he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant hybridization because of observations of corn varieties this observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend james petiver first my friend planted a row of indian corn that was coloured red and blue the rest of the field being planted with corn of the yellow which is the most usual color to the windward side this red and blue row so infected three or four whole rows as to communicate the same colour unto them and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth but to the leeward side no less than seven or eight rows had ye same colour communicated unto them and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off in november  mathers wife newborn twins and two yearold daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic he was twice widowed and only two of his  children survived him he died on the day after his th birthday and was buried on copps hill near old north church boyles influence on matheredit robert boyle was a huge influence throughout mathers career he read boyles the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy closely throughout the s and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it using almost identical language to boylepage needed increase matheredit mathers relationship with his father increase mather is thought by some to have been strained and difficult increase was a pastor of the north square church and president of harvard college he led an accomplished life despite cottons efforts he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father he did surpass his fathers output as a writer writing more than  books one of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials which increase mather reportedly did not support yale collegeedit cotton mather helped convince elihu yale to make a donation to a new college in new haven which became yale college salem witch trials of  the mather influenceedit pretrialsedit in  mather published memorable providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the goodwin family in boston catholic washerwoman goody glover was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case mather had a prominent role in this case besides praying for the children which also included fasting and meditation he would also observe and record their activities the children were subject to hysterical fits which he detailed in memorable providences in his book mather argued that since there are witches and devils there are immortal souls he also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves he opposed any natural explainations for the fits he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil and he argued that spectral evidence should not be used as evidence for witchcraft robert calef was a contemporary of mather and critical of him and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the salem witch trials three years later mr cotton mather was the most active and forward of any minister in the country in those matters taking home one of the children and managing such intreagues with that child and after printing such an account of the whole in his memorable providences as conduced much to the kindling of those flames that in sir williams time threatened the devouring of this country nineteenthcentury historian charles wentworth upham shared the view that the afflicted in salem were imitating the goodwin children but he put the blame on both cotton and his father increase mather they are answerable more than almost any other men have been for the opinions of their time it was indeed a superstitious age but made much more so by their operations influence and writings beginning with increase mathers movement at the assembly of ministers in  and ending with cotton mathers dealings with the goodwin children and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide for this reason then in the first place i hold those two men responsible for what is called salem witchcraft the courtedit mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning sir william phips governor of the newly chartered province of massachusetts bay appointed his lieutenant governor william stoughton as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts where he presided over the witch trials according to george bancroft mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under phips through the intervention of mathers own politically powerful father increase intercession had been made by cotton mather for the advancement of stoughton a man of cold affections proud selfwilled and covetous of distinction apparently mather saw in stoughton a bachelor who had never wed an ally for churchrelated matters bancroft quotes mathers reaction to stoughtons appointment as follows the time for a favor is come exulted cotton mather yea the set time is come mather claimed not to have attended the trials in salem although his father attended the trial of george burroughs his contemporaries calef and thomas brattle place him at the executions see below mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end if in the midst of the many dissatisfaction among us the publication of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto god for justice being so far executed among us i shall rejoyce that god is glorified mather called himself a historian not an advocate but according to one modern writer his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling martha carrier a rampant hag mather referred to george burroughs as a very puny man whose tergiversations contradictions and falsehoods made his testimony not worth consideringpage needed use of spectral evidenceedit mathers most significant influence over the trials was in composing the answer to the question of whether or not to allow spectral evidence the afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant invisible to any but themselves was tormenting them this was considered evidence of witchcraft despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held christian beliefs an opinion on the matter was sought from the most esteemed ministers of the area and mather took credit for their response when anonymously celebrating himself years later drawn up at their desire by cotton mather the younger as i have been informedpage needed on may   mather wrote to one of the judges john richards a member of his congregationpage needed expressing his support of the prosecutions but cautioning do not lay more stress on pure spectral evidence than it will bear  it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also very virtuous though i believe that the just god then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused thomas hutchinson summarized the letter the two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before reprinting the letter years later in magnalia mather notably omitted the fateful two first and the last sections the original full version of the letter called return of the several ministers was dated june   and had been reprinted in late  in the final two pages of increase mathers cases of conscience it is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument calef calls it perfectly ambidexter giving as great as greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods then cautions against them indeed the advice then given looks most like a thing of his composing as carrying both fire to increase and water to quench the conflagration regarding spectral evidence upham concludes that cotton mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it never advised its absolute exclusion but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption  and once admitted nothing could stand against it character reason common sense were swept away in a letter to an english clergyman in  boston intellectual thomas brattle criticizing the trials said of the judges use of spectral evidence the sg salem gentlemen will by no means allow that any are brought in guilty and condemned by virtue of spectre evidence but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences that these persons are found guilty considering what before has been said i leave you and any man of sense to judge and determine the later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by governor phips around the same time his own wife lady mary phipss name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft began in january  this immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions due to a reprieve by phips there were no further executions phipss actions were vigorously opposed by william stoughton bancroft notes that mather considered witches among the poor and vile and ragged beggars upon earth and bancroft asserts that mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates calef places mather at the scene of the execution of george burroughs and four others who were executed after mather spoke and shows him playing a direct and influential role mr buroughs sic was carried in a cart with others through the streets of salem to execution when he was upon the ladder he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present his prayer which he concluded by repeating the lords prayer as witches were not supposed to be able to recite was so well worded and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit as was very affecting and drew tears from many so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution the accusers said the black man devil stood and dictated to him as soon as he was turned off hanged mr cotton mather being mounted upon a horse addressed himself to the people partly to declare that he mr burroughs was no ordained minister partly to possess the people of his guilt saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light and this did somewhat appease the people and the executions went on when he mr burroughs was cut down he was dragged by a halter to a hole or grave between the rocks about two feet deep his shirt and breeches being pulled off and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts he was so put in together with john willard and martha carrier that one of his hands and his chin and a foot of one of them was left uncovered posttrialsedit in the years after the trials of the principal actors in the trial whose lives are recorded after neither he nor stoughton ever admitted to any misgivings in the years after the trials he became an increasingly vehement defender of them at the request of then ltgov stoughton mather wrote wonders of the invisible world during the trials which were published in  the book contained a few of mathers sermons the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in europe he somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in return of the several ministers by defending the use of spectral evidence wonders of the invisible world appeared at the same time as increase mathers cases of conscience mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially oct th  cm letter to his uncle there are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press containing cases of conscience about witchcraft i did in my conscience think that as the humors of this people now run such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witchadvocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches considered in parcels while things as they lay in bulk with their whole dependencies were not exposed but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice  more than so produce a public  open contest with the judges who would tho beyond the intention of the worthy author  subscribers find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile mob — october   letter to his uncle john cotton the last event in mathers involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure mercy short and margaret rule boston merchant robert calef began his eightyear campaign against the influential mathers calefs book was inspired by the fear that mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of  he quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges upon reading calefs more wonders of the invisible world increase mather cottons father publicly burned the book in harvard yard poole vs uphamedit in  william frederick poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on cotton mathers role in the witch trials if anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking who got up salem witchcraft he will reply cotton mather let him try another boy who was cotton mather and the answer will come the man who was on horseback and hung witches poole was a librarian and a lover of literature including mathers magnalia and other books and tracts numbering nearly  which were never so prized by collectors as today poole announced his intention to redeem mathers name using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by charles wentworth upham salem witchcraft volumes i and ii with an account of salem village and a history of opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects which runs to almost  pages and a quick search of the name mather referring to either father son or ancestors shows that it occurs  times pooles critique in book form runs less than  pages but the name mather occurs many more times than the other book which is more than ten times as long upham shows a balanced and complicated view of cotton mather such as this first mention one of cotton mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master it flows from a heart warm with gratitude uphams book refers to robert calef no fewer than  times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by calef in the mids and stating although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions there is no ground to dispute the veracity of calef as to matters of fact he goes on to say that calefs collection of writings gave a shock to mathers influence from which it never recoveredcitation needed calef produced only the one book he is selfeffacing and apologetic for his limitations and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector poole champion of literature cannot accept calef whose faculties as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order and his book in our opinion has a reputation much beyond its merits poole refers to calef as mathers personal enemy and opens a line without discussing the character and motives of calef but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn calef upham responded to poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title referring to poole as the reviewer many of pooles arguments were addressed but both authors emphasize the importance of cotton mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence as copied in the final pages called the return of several ministers of increase mathers cases of conscience in  historian george lincoln burr sided with upham in a note on thomas brattles letter the strange suggestion of w f poole that brattle here means cotton mather himself is adequately answered by upham burr reprinted calef in full and dug deep into the historical record for information on the man and concludes that he had else any grievance against the mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think burr finds that a comparison between calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactnesscitation needed mather revivalists th century revisionedit since the poole vs upham debate several scholars have rexamined mathers reputation and his role in the witchcraft trials  cotton mather the puritan priest by barret wendall an english professor at harvard university wendall played a leading role in the mather revival but he might have been surprised to see how far the wheel turned his book often expresses agreement with upham and unlike poole he simply announces his intention to show cotton mather in a more positive light “cotton mather gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other” and some pages later “robert calef’s temper was that of the rational eighteenth century the mathers belonged rather to the sixteenth the age of passionate religious enthusiasm”  life and times of cotton mather by rev abijah p marvin published by congregational sunday school and publishing society this work tends to paraphrase cotton mather’s artfully constructed diary marvin presents a lengthy critique of robert calef  increase mather the foremost american puritan by kenneth b murdock harvard university press murdock studied under wendall and is also critical of cotton mather but in a strong desire to show increase mather in a positive light he omits much  cotton mather a bibliography by tj holmes harvard university press holmes was librarian at the william g mather library his notes are pugilistic and promather but holmes published for the first time cotton mather’s october   letter see above to his uncle opposing an end to the trials  the devil in massachusetts a modern inquiry into the salem witch trials by marion l starkey she feels that mather was not as active in the salem trials as others give him credit for she does bring up that mather did denounce torture as a way to get a confession and cautioned against the use of spectral evidence  the intellectual life of colonial new england by samuel eliot morison morison believes that mather found balance and levelthinking during the witchcraft trials he also believes that calef had an agenda against mather which stuck with him over time  selected letters of cotton mather by ken silverman louisiana state university press on page  silverman writes “actually mather had very little to do with the trials” twelve pages later he publishes for the first time to chief judge william stoughton on september   in which cotton mather writes “ i hope i can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen” and continues “i have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance”  the admirable cotton mather by james playsted wood a young adult book in the preface wood writes that a “changed attitude” began with wendall above and passed to murdock above and another colleague in the harvard english department lyman kittredge the intricate relationship of the mathers to harvard with a revisionist movement emerging from the same institution can at times give an uncomfortable aspect of history being bent to team spiritcitation needed ongoing revisionedit chadwick hansens witchcraft at salem published in  presents mather as a positive influence on the salem trials he considered mathers handling of the goodwin children to be sane and temperate that he was more concerned with helping the afflicted than witchhunting and treated the children with prayer and fasting hansen wrote that mather was a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed — or feigned confession — such as tituba and dorcas good and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in wonders of the invisible world after some others had lamented the roles they played in the executions and imprisonments mather and stoughton remained the chief defenders of the trials which diminishes the view of him as a moderate influence historian larry gregg highlights mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when mather stated the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also the very virtuous writing in the early s historian john demos imputed to mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials smallpox inoculation controversyedit the practice of smallpox inoculation as opposed to the later practice of vaccination was developed possibly in thcentury india or thcentury china spreading its reach in seventeenthcentury turkey inoculation or rather variolation involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox variola to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity by the beginning of the th century the royal society in england was discussing the practice of inoculation and the smallpox epidemic in  spurred further interest it was not until  however that england recorded its first case of inoculation early new englandedit smallpox was a serious threat in colonial america most devastating to native americans but also to angloamerican settlers new england suffered smallpox epidemics in  – and  it was highly contagious and mortality could reach as high as  percent boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in  and  during this era public authorities in massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine incoming ships were quarantined in boston harbor and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse in  mathers slave onesimus explained to mather how he had been inoculated as a child in africa mather was fascinated by the idea by july  he had read an endorsement of inoculation by dr emanuel timonius of constantinople in the philosophical transactions mather then declared in a letter to dr john woodward of gresham college in london that he planned to press bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again by  a whole generation of young bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared on april  of that year the hms seahorse arrived from the west indies carrying smallpox on board despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine eight known cases of smallpox appeared in boston by may  and by midjune the disease was spreading at an alarming rate as a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread many residents fled to outlying rural settlements the combination of exodus quarantine and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the bay colony for weeks guards were stationed at the house of representatives to keep bostonians from entering without special permission the death toll reached  in september and the selectmen powerless to stop it severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll as one response legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who under these conditions could no longer support their familiescitation needed on june   mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by timonius and jacobus pylarinus to local physicians urging them to consult about the matter he received no response next mather pleaded his case to dr zabdiel boylston who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves — one grown and one a boy all recovered in about a week boylston inoculated seven more people by midjuly the epidemic peaked in october  with  deaths by february   boston was again free from smallpox the total number of cases since april  came to  with  deaths—more than threequarters of all the deaths in boston during  meanwhile boylston had inoculated  people with six resulting deaths inoculation debateedit boylston and mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid clamour among the people of boston both boylston and mather were objects of their fury their furious obloquies and invectives which mather acknowledges in his diary bostons selectmen consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection forbade boylston from performing it again the newengland courant published writers who opposed the practice the editorial stance was that the boston populace feared that inoculation spread rather than prevented the disease however some historians notably h w brands have argued that this position was a result of the contrarian positions of editorinchief james franklin a brother of benjamin franklin public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by reverend john williams from boston who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of physick either natural or divine and therefore unlawful to those put forth in a pamphlet by dr william douglass of boston entitled the abuses and scandals of some late pamphlets in favour of inoculation of the small pox  on the qualifications of inoculations proponents douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from europe at the extreme in november  someone hurled a lighted grenade into mathers home medical oppositionedit several opponents of smallpox inoculation among them rev john williams stated that there were only two laws of physick medicine sympathy and antipathy in his estimation inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease or an antipathy toward one but the creation of one for this reason its practice violated the natural laws of medicine transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal as with most colonists williams puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life and he used the bible to state his case he quoted matthew  when jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick dr william douglass proposed a more secular argument against inoculation stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices in addition he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise according to douglass smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence one not to be undertaken lightly he believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony including that of caring for the sick they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented the only reason mather had had success in it he said was because mather had used it on children who are naturally more resilient douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection speak out he did the battle between these two prestigious adversaries douglass and mather lasted far longer than the epidemic itself and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous puritan resistanceedit generally puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments increase mather cottons father was joined by prominent pastors benjamin colman and william cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations one of the classic assumptions of the puritan mind was that the will of god was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation nevertheless williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of god and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most high he also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by god as punishment for sin and warned that attempting to shield themselves from gods fury via inoculation would only serve to provoke him more puritans found meaning in affliction and they did not yet know why god was showing them disfavor through smallpox not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand many puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art they grappled with adhering to the ten commandments with being proper church members and good caring neighbors the apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the sixth commandment – thou shalt not kill — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the bible it was not the will of god and therefore unlawful he explained that inoculation violated the golden rule because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him with the bible as the puritans source for all decisionmaking lack of scriptural evidence concerned many and williams vocally scorned mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the bible inoculation defendededit with the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day the use of quarantine and various other efforts such as balancing the bodys humors did not slow the spread of the disease as news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people by circa  smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the atlantic world mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of god and argued the procedure was not outside of puritan principles he wrote that whether a christian may not employ this medicine let the matter of it be what it will and humbly give thanks to gods good providence in discovering of it to a miserable world and humbly look up to his good providence as we do in the use of any other medicine it may seem strange that any wise christian cannot answer it and how strangely do men that call themselves physicians betray their anatomy and their philosophy as well as their divinity in their invectives against this practice the puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone both the good and the wicked yet god had provided them with the means to save themselves mather reported that from his view none that have used it ever died of the small pox tho at the same time it were so malignant that at least half the people died that were infected with it in the common way while mather was experimenting with the procedure prominent puritan pastors benjamin colman and william cooper expressed public and theological support for them the practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to firsthand experiences and personal relationships although many were initially wary of the concept it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results within their own community of ordinary citizens that it became widely utilized and supported one important change in the practice after  was regulated quarantine of innoculees the aftermathedit although mather and boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of – after overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success boylston traveled to london in  where he published his results and was elected to the royal society in  with mather formally receiving the honor two years

mathers thoughts and opinions on the bible and how he interpreted it biblia americana is incredibly large and mather worked on it from  until  when he died mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it people did not have to choose one or the other in biblia americana mather looked at the bible through a scientific

workedit richard mather john cotton – mather was born in boston massachusetts bay colony the son of maria née cotton and increase mather and grandson of both john cotton and richard mather all also prominent puritan ministers mather was named after his maternal grandfather john cotton he attended boston latin school where his name was posthumously added to its hall of fame and graduated from harvard in  at age  after completing his postgraduate work he joined his father as assistant pastor of bostons original north church not to be confused with the anglicanepiscopal old north church of paul revere fame in  mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church mather lived on hanover street boston – mather wrote more than  books and pamphlets and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in america he set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second and thirdgeneration puritans to return to the theological roots of puritanism whose parents had left england for the new england colonies of north america the most important of these was magnalia christi americana  which comprises seven distinct books many of which depict biographical and historical narrativescitation needed the mather tomb in copps hill cemetery mather was not known for writing in a neutral unbiased perspective many if not all of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons according to literary historian sacvan bercovitch few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did cotton mather none more clearly exemplified it explicitly or implicitly he projects himself everywhere in his writings in the most direct compensatory sense he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress he tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own his essays on the riches of christ to repay his benefactors his tracts on morality to convert his enemies his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child wife or friend mather influenced early american science in  he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant hybridization because of observations of corn varieties this observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend james petiver first my friend planted a row of indian corn that was coloured red and blue the rest of the field being planted with corn of the yellow which is the most usual color to the windward side this red and blue row so infected three or four whole rows as to communicate the same colour unto them and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth but to the leeward side no less than seven or eight rows had ye same colour communicated unto them and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off in november  mathers wife newborn twins and two yearold daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic he was twice widowed and only two of his  children survived him he died on the day after his th birthday and was buried on copps hill near old north church boyles influence on matheredit robert boyle was a huge influence throughout mathers career he read boyles the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy closely throughout the s and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it using almost identical language to boylepage needed increase matheredit mathers relationship with his father increase mather is thought by some to have been strained and difficult increase was a pastor of the north square church and president of harvard college he led an accomplished life despite cottons efforts he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father he did surpass his fathers output as a writer writing more than  books one of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials which increase mather reportedly did not support yale collegeedit cotton mather helped convince elihu yale to make a donation to a new college in new haven which became yale college salem witch trials of  the mather influenceedit pretrialsedit in  mather published memorable providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the goodwin family in boston catholic washerwoman goody glover was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case mather had a prominent role in this case besides praying for the children which also included fasting and meditation he would also observe and record their activities the children were subject to hysterical fits which he detailed in memorable providences in his book mather argued that since there are witches and devils there are immortal souls he also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves he opposed any natural explainations for the fits he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil and he argued that spectral evidence should not be used as evidence for witchcraft robert calef was a contemporary of mather and critical of him and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the salem witch trials three years later mr cotton mather was the most active and forward of any minister in the country in those matters taking home one of the children and managing such intreagues with that child and after printing such an account of the whole in his memorable providences as conduced much to the kindling of those flames that in sir williams time threatened the devouring of this country nineteenthcentury historian charles wentworth upham shared the view that the afflicted in salem were imitating the goodwin children but he put the blame on both cotton and his father increase mather they are answerable more than almost any other men have been for the opinions of their time it was indeed a superstitious age but made much more so by their operations influence and writings beginning with increase mathers movement at the assembly of ministers in  and ending with cotton mathers dealings with the goodwin children and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide for this reason then in the first place i hold those two men responsible for what is called salem witchcraft the courtedit mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning sir william phips governor of the newly chartered province of massachusetts bay appointed his lieutenant governor william stoughton as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts where he presided over the witch trials according to george bancroft mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under phips through the intervention of mathers own politically powerful father increase intercession had been made by cotton mather for the advancement of stoughton a man of cold affections proud selfwilled and covetous of distinction apparently mather saw in stoughton a bachelor who had never wed an ally for churchrelated matters bancroft quotes mathers reaction to stoughtons appointment as follows the time for a favor is come exulted cotton mather yea the set time is come mather claimed not to have attended the trials in salem although his father attended the trial of george burroughs his contemporaries calef and thomas brattle place him at the executions see below mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end if in the midst of the many dissatisfaction among us the publication of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto god for justice being so far executed among us i shall rejoyce that god is glorified mather called himself a historian not an advocate but according to one modern writer his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling martha carrier a rampant hag mather referred to george burroughs as a very puny man whose tergiversations contradictions and falsehoods made his testimony not worth consideringpage needed use of spectral evidenceedit mathers most significant influence over the trials was in composing the answer to the question of whether or not to allow spectral evidence the afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant invisible to any but themselves was tormenting them this was considered evidence of witchcraft despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held christian beliefs an opinion on the matter was sought from the most esteemed ministers of the area and mather took credit for their response when anonymously celebrating himself years later drawn up at their desire by cotton mather the younger as i have been informedpage needed on may   mather wrote to one of the judges john richards a member of his congregationpage needed expressing his support of the prosecutions but cautioning do not lay more stress on pure spectral evidence than it will bear  it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also very virtuous though i believe that the just god then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused thomas hutchinson summarized the letter the two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before reprinting the letter years later in magnalia mather notably omitted the fateful two first and the last sections the original full version of the letter called return of the several ministers was dated june   and had been reprinted in late  in the final two pages of increase mathers cases of conscience it is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument calef calls it perfectly ambidexter giving as great as greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods then cautions against them indeed the advice then given looks most like a thing of his composing as carrying both fire to increase and water to quench the conflagration regarding spectral evidence upham concludes that cotton mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it never advised its absolute exclusion but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption  and once admitted nothing could stand against it character reason common sense were swept away in a letter to an english clergyman in  boston intellectual thomas brattle criticizing the trials said of the judges use of spectral evidence the sg salem gentlemen will by no means allow that any are brought in guilty and condemned by virtue of spectre evidence but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences that these persons are found guilty considering what before has been said i leave you and any man of sense to judge and determine the later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by governor phips around the same time his own wife lady mary phipss name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft began in january  this immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions due to a reprieve by phips there were no further executions phipss actions were vigorously opposed by william stoughton bancroft notes that mather considered witches among the poor and vile and ragged beggars upon earth and bancroft asserts that mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates calef places mather at the scene of the execution of george burroughs and four others who were executed after mather spoke and shows him playing a direct and influential role mr buroughs sic was carried in a cart with others through the streets of salem to execution when he was upon the ladder he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present his prayer which he concluded by repeating the lords prayer as witches were not supposed to be able to recite was so well worded and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit as was very affecting and drew tears from many so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution the accusers said the black man devil stood and dictated to him as soon as he was turned off hanged mr cotton mather being mounted upon a horse addressed himself to the people partly to declare that he mr burroughs was no ordained minister partly to possess the people of his guilt saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light and this did somewhat appease the people and the executions went on when he mr burroughs was cut down he was dragged by a halter to a hole or grave between the rocks about two feet deep his shirt and breeches being pulled off and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts he was so put in together with john willard and martha carrier that one of his hands and his chin and a foot of one of them was left uncovered posttrialsedit in the years after the trials of the principal actors in the trial whose lives are recorded after neither he nor stoughton ever admitted to any misgivings in the years after the trials he became an increasingly vehement defender of them at the request of then ltgov stoughton mather wrote wonders of the invisible world during the trials which were published in  the book contained a few of mathers sermons the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in europe he somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in return of the several ministers by defending the use of spectral evidence wonders of the invisible world appeared at the same time as increase mathers cases of conscience mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially oct th  cm letter to his uncle there are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press containing cases of conscience about witchcraft i did in my conscience think that as the humors of this people now run such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witchadvocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches considered in parcels while things as they lay in bulk with their whole dependencies were not exposed but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice  more than so produce a public  open contest with the judges who would tho beyond the intention of the worthy author  subscribers find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile mob — october   letter to his uncle john cotton the last event in mathers involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure mercy short and margaret rule boston merchant robert calef began his eightyear campaign against the influential mathers calefs book was inspired by the fear that mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of  he quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges upon reading calefs more wonders of the invisible world increase mather cottons father publicly burned the book in harvard yard poole vs uphamedit in  william frederick poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on cotton mathers role in the witch trials if anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking who got up salem witchcraft he will reply cotton mather let him try another boy who was cotton mather and the answer will come the man who was on horseback and hung witches poole was a librarian and a lover of literature including mathers magnalia and other books and tracts numbering nearly  which were never so prized by collectors as today poole announced his intention to redeem mathers name using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by charles wentworth upham salem witchcraft volumes i and ii with an account of salem village and a history of opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects which runs to almost  pages and a quick search of the name mather referring to either father son or ancestors shows that it occurs  times pooles critique in book form runs less than  pages but the name mather occurs many more times than the other book which is more than ten times as long upham shows a balanced and complicated view of cotton mather such as this first mention one of cotton mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master it flows from a heart warm with gratitude uphams book refers to robert calef no fewer than  times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by calef in the mids and stating although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions there is no ground to dispute the veracity of calef as to matters of fact he goes on to say that calefs collection of writings gave a shock to mathers influence from which it never recoveredcitation needed calef produced only the one book he is selfeffacing and apologetic for his limitations and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector poole champion of literature cannot accept calef whose faculties as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order and his book in our opinion has a reputation much beyond its merits poole refers to calef as mathers personal enemy and opens a line without discussing the character and motives of calef but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn calef upham responded to poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title referring to poole as the reviewer many of pooles arguments were addressed but both authors emphasize the importance of cotton mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence as copied in the final pages called the return of several ministers of increase mathers cases of conscience in  historian george lincoln burr sided with upham in a note on thomas brattles letter the strange suggestion of w f poole that brattle here means cotton mather himself is adequately answered by upham burr reprinted calef in full and dug deep into the historical record for information on the man and concludes that he had else any grievance against the mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think burr finds that a comparison between calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactnesscitation needed mather revivalists th century revisionedit since the poole vs upham debate several scholars have rexamined mathers reputation and his role in the witchcraft trials  cotton mather the puritan priest by barret wendall an english professor at harvard university wendall played a leading role in the mather revival but he might have been surprised to see how far the wheel turned his book often expresses agreement with upham and unlike poole he simply announces his intention to show cotton mather in a more positive light “cotton mather gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other” and some pages later “robert calef’s temper was that of the rational eighteenth century the mathers belonged rather to the sixteenth the age of passionate religious enthusiasm”  life and times of cotton mather by rev abijah p marvin published by congregational sunday school and publishing society this work tends to paraphrase cotton mather’s artfully constructed diary marvin presents a lengthy critique of robert calef  increase mather the foremost american puritan by kenneth b murdock harvard university press murdock studied under wendall and is also critical of cotton mather but in a strong desire to show increase mather in a positive light he omits much  cotton mather a bibliography by tj holmes harvard university press holmes was librarian at the william g mather library his notes are pugilistic and promather but holmes published for the first time cotton mather’s october   letter see above to his uncle opposing an end to the trials  the devil in massachusetts a modern inquiry into the salem witch trials by marion l starkey she feels that mather was not as active in the salem trials as others give him credit for she does bring up that mather did denounce torture as a way to get a confession and cautioned against the use of spectral evidence  the intellectual life of colonial new england by samuel eliot morison morison believes that mather found balance and levelthinking during the witchcraft trials he also believes that calef had an agenda against mather which stuck with him over time  selected letters of cotton mather by ken silverman louisiana state university press on page  silverman writes “actually mather had very little to do with the trials” twelve pages later he publishes for the first time to chief judge william stoughton on september   in which cotton mather writes “ i hope i can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen” and continues “i have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance”  the admirable cotton mather by james playsted wood a young adult book in the preface wood writes that a “changed attitude” began with wendall above and passed to murdock above and another colleague in the harvard english department lyman kittredge the intricate relationship of the mathers to harvard with a revisionist movement emerging from the same institution can at times give an uncomfortable aspect of history being bent to team spiritcitation needed ongoing revisionedit chadwick hansens witchcraft at salem published in  presents mather as a positive influence on the salem trials he considered mathers handling of the goodwin children to be sane and temperate that he was more concerned with helping the afflicted than witchhunting and treated the children with prayer and fasting hansen wrote that mather was a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed — or feigned confession — such as tituba and dorcas good and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in wonders of the invisible world after some others had lamented the roles they played in the executions and imprisonments mather and stoughton remained the chief defenders of the trials which diminishes the view of him as a moderate influence historian larry gregg highlights mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when mather stated the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also the very virtuous writing in the early s historian john demos imputed to mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials smallpox inoculation controversyedit the practice of smallpox inoculation as opposed to the later practice of vaccination was developed possibly in thcentury india or thcentury china spreading its reach in seventeenthcentury turkey inoculation or rather variolation involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox variola to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity by the beginning of the th century the royal society in england was discussing the practice of inoculation and the smallpox epidemic in  spurred further interest it was not until  however that england recorded its first case of inoculation early new englandedit smallpox was a serious threat in colonial america most devastating to native americans but also to angloamerican settlers new england suffered smallpox epidemics in  – and  it was highly contagious and mortality could reach as high as  percent boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in  and  during this era public authorities in massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine incoming ships were quarantined in boston harbor and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse in  mathers slave onesimus explained to mather how he had been inoculated as a child in africa mather was fascinated by the idea by july  he had read an endorsement of inoculation by dr emanuel timonius of constantinople in the philosophical transactions mather then declared in a letter to dr john woodward of gresham college in london that he planned to press bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again by  a whole generation of young bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared on april  of that year the hms seahorse arrived from the west indies carrying smallpox on board despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine eight known cases of smallpox appeared in boston by may  and by midjune the disease was spreading at an alarming rate as a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread many residents fled to outlying rural settlements the combination of exodus quarantine and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the bay colony for weeks guards were stationed at the house of representatives to keep bostonians from entering without special permission the death toll reached  in september and the selectmen powerless to stop it severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll as one response legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who under these conditions could no longer support their familiescitation needed on june   mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by timonius and jacobus pylarinus to local physicians urging them to consult about the matter he received no response next mather pleaded his case to dr zabdiel boylston who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves — one grown and one a boy all recovered in about a week boylston inoculated seven more people by midjuly the epidemic peaked in october  with  deaths by february   boston was again free from smallpox the total number of cases since april  came to  with  deaths—more than threequarters of all the deaths in boston during  meanwhile boylston had inoculated  people with six resulting deaths inoculation debateedit boylston and mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid clamour among the people of boston both boylston and mather were objects of their fury their furious obloquies and invectives which mather acknowledges in his diary bostons selectmen consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection forbade boylston from performing it again the newengland courant published writers who opposed the practice the editorial stance was that the boston populace feared that inoculation spread rather than prevented the disease however some historians notably h w brands have argued that this position was a result of the contrarian positions of editorinchief james franklin a brother of benjamin franklin public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by reverend john williams from boston who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of physick either natural or divine and therefore unlawful to those put forth in a pamphlet by dr william douglass of boston entitled the abuses and scandals of some late pamphlets in favour of inoculation of the small pox  on the qualifications of inoculations proponents douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from europe at the extreme in november  someone hurled a lighted grenade into mathers home medical oppositionedit several opponents of smallpox inoculation among them rev john williams stated that there were only two laws of physick medicine sympathy and antipathy in his estimation inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease or an antipathy toward one but the creation of one for this reason its practice violated the natural laws of medicine transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal as with most colonists williams puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life and he used the bible to state his case he quoted matthew  when jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick dr william douglass proposed a more secular argument against inoculation stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices in addition he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise according to douglass smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence one not to be undertaken lightly he believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony including that of caring for the sick they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented the only reason mather had had success in it he said was because mather had used it on children who are naturally more resilient douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection speak out he did the battle between these two prestigious adversaries douglass and mather lasted far longer than the epidemic itself and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous puritan resistanceedit generally puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments increase mather cottons father was joined by prominent pastors benjamin colman and william cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations one of the classic assumptions of the puritan mind was that the will of god was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation nevertheless williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of god and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most high he also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by god as punishment for sin and warned that attempting to shield themselves from gods fury via inoculation would only serve to provoke him more puritans found meaning in affliction and they did not yet know why god was showing them disfavor through smallpox not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand many puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art they grappled with adhering to the ten commandments with being proper church members and good caring neighbors the apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the sixth commandment – thou shalt not kill — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the bible it was not the will of god and therefore unlawful he explained that inoculation violated the golden rule because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him with the bible as the puritans source for all decisionmaking lack of scriptural evidence concerned many and williams vocally scorned mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the bible inoculation defendededit with the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day the use of quarantine and various other efforts such as balancing the bodys humors did not slow the spread of the disease as news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people by circa  smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the atlantic world mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of god and argued the procedure was not outside of puritan principles he wrote that whether a christian may not employ this medicine let the matter of it be what it will and humbly give thanks to gods good providence in discovering of it to a miserable world and humbly look up to his good providence as we do in the use of any other medicine it may seem strange that any wise christian cannot answer it and how strangely do men that call themselves physicians betray their anatomy and their philosophy as well as their divinity in their invectives against this practice the puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone both the good and the wicked yet god had provided them with the means to save themselves mather reported that from his view none that have used it ever died of the small pox tho at the same time it were so malignant that at least half the people died that were infected with it in the common way while mather was experimenting with the procedure prominent puritan pastors benjamin colman and william cooper expressed public and theological support for them the practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to firsthand experiences and personal relationships although many were initially wary of the concept it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results within their own community of ordinary citizens that it became widely utilized and supported one important change in the practice after  was regulated quarantine of innoculees the aftermathedit although mather and boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of – after overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success boylston traveled to london in  where he published his results and was elected to the royal society in  with mather formally receiving the honor two years

an abundance of unfinished writings including one entitled the biblia americana mather believed that biblia americana was the best thing he had ever written his masterwork biblia americana contained mathers thoughts and opinions on the bible and how he interpreted it biblia americana is incredibly large and mather worked on it from  until  when he died mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it people did not have to choose one or the other in biblia americana mather looked at the bible through a scientific perspective completely opposite to his perspective in the christian philosopher in which he approached science in a religious manner pillars of saltedit mathers first published sermon printed in

thcentury islamic philosopher abu bakr ibn tufailcitation needed despite condemning the mahometans as infidels mather viewed the novels protagonist hayy as a model for his ideal christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist mather viewed hayy as a noble savage and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the native american indians in order to convert them to puritan christianity

workedit richard mather john cotton – mather was born in boston massachusetts bay colony the son of maria née cotton and increase mather and grandson of both john cotton and richard mather all also prominent puritan ministers mather was named after his maternal grandfather john cotton he attended boston latin school where his name was posthumously added to its hall of fame and graduated from harvard in  at age  after completing his postgraduate work he joined his father as assistant pastor of bostons original north church not to be confused with the anglicanepiscopal old north church of paul revere fame in  mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church mather lived on hanover street boston – mather wrote more than  books and pamphlets and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in america he set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second and thirdgeneration puritans to return to the theological roots of puritanism whose parents had left england for the new england colonies of north america the most important of these was magnalia christi americana  which comprises seven distinct books many of which depict biographical and historical narrativescitation needed the mather tomb in copps hill cemetery mather was not known for writing in a neutral unbiased perspective many if not all of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons according to literary historian sacvan bercovitch few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did cotton mather none more clearly exemplified it explicitly or implicitly he projects himself everywhere in his writings in the most direct compensatory sense he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress he tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own his essays on the riches of christ to repay his benefactors his tracts on morality to convert his enemies his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child wife or friend mather influenced early american science in  he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant hybridization because of observations of corn varieties this observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend james petiver first my friend planted a row of indian corn that was coloured red and blue the rest of the field being planted with corn of the yellow which is the most usual color to the windward side this red and blue row so infected three or four whole rows as to communicate the same colour unto them and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth but to the leeward side no less than seven or eight rows had ye same colour communicated unto them and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off in november  mathers wife newborn twins and two yearold daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic he was twice widowed and only two of his  children survived him he died on the day after his th birthday and was buried on copps hill near old north church boyles influence on matheredit robert boyle was a huge influence throughout mathers career he read boyles the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy closely throughout the s and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it using almost identical language to boylepage needed increase matheredit mathers relationship with his father increase mather is thought by some to have been strained and difficult increase was a pastor of the north square church and president of harvard college he led an accomplished life despite cottons efforts he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father he did surpass his fathers output as a writer writing more than  books one of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials which increase mather reportedly did not support yale collegeedit cotton mather helped convince elihu yale to make a donation to a new college in new haven which became yale college salem witch trials of  the mather influenceedit pretrialsedit in  mather published memorable providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the goodwin family in boston catholic washerwoman goody glover was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case mather had a prominent role in this case besides praying for the children which also included fasting and meditation he would also observe and record their activities the children were subject to hysterical fits which he detailed in memorable providences in his book mather argued that since there are witches and devils there are immortal souls he also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves he opposed any natural explainations for the fits he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil and he argued that spectral evidence should not be used as evidence for witchcraft robert calef was a contemporary of mather and critical of him and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the salem witch trials three years later mr cotton mather was the most active and forward of any minister in the country in those matters taking home one of the children and managing such intreagues with that child and after printing such an account of the whole in his memorable providences as conduced much to the kindling of those flames that in sir williams time threatened the devouring of this country nineteenthcentury historian charles wentworth upham shared the view that the afflicted in salem were imitating the goodwin children but he put the blame on both cotton and his father increase mather they are answerable more than almost any other men have been for the opinions of their time it was indeed a superstitious age but made much more so by their operations influence and writings beginning with increase mathers movement at the assembly of ministers in  and ending with cotton mathers dealings with the goodwin children and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide for this reason then in the first place i hold those two men responsible for what is called salem witchcraft the courtedit mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning sir william phips governor of the newly chartered province of massachusetts bay appointed his lieutenant governor william stoughton as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts where he presided over the witch trials according to george bancroft mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under phips through the intervention of mathers own politically powerful father increase intercession had been made by cotton mather for the advancement of stoughton a man of cold affections proud selfwilled and covetous of distinction apparently mather saw in stoughton a bachelor who had never wed an ally for churchrelated matters bancroft quotes mathers reaction to stoughtons appointment as follows the time for a favor is come exulted cotton mather yea the set time is come mather claimed not to have attended the trials in salem although his father attended the trial of george burroughs his contemporaries calef and thomas brattle place him at the executions see below mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end if in the midst of the many dissatisfaction among us the publication of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto god for justice being so far executed among us i shall rejoyce that god is glorified mather called himself a historian not an advocate but according to one modern writer his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling martha carrier a rampant hag mather referred to george burroughs as a very puny man whose tergiversations contradictions and falsehoods made his testimony not worth consideringpage needed use of spectral evidenceedit mathers most significant influence over the trials was in composing the answer to the question of whether or not to allow spectral evidence the afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant invisible to any but themselves was tormenting them this was considered evidence of witchcraft despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held christian beliefs an opinion on the matter was sought from the most esteemed ministers of the area and mather took credit for their response when anonymously celebrating himself years later drawn up at their desire by cotton mather the younger as i have been informedpage needed on may   mather wrote to one of the judges john richards a member of his congregationpage needed expressing his support of the prosecutions but cautioning do not lay more stress on pure spectral evidence than it will bear  it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also very virtuous though i believe that the just god then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused thomas hutchinson summarized the letter the two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before reprinting the letter years later in magnalia mather notably omitted the fateful two first and the last sections the original full version of the letter called return of the several ministers was dated june   and had been reprinted in late  in the final two pages of increase mathers cases of conscience it is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument calef calls it perfectly ambidexter giving as great as greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods then cautions against them indeed the advice then given looks most like a thing of his composing as carrying both fire to increase and water to quench the conflagration regarding spectral evidence upham concludes that cotton mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it never advised its absolute exclusion but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption  and once admitted nothing could stand against it character reason common sense were swept away in a letter to an english clergyman in  boston intellectual thomas brattle criticizing the trials said of the judges use of spectral evidence the sg salem gentlemen will by no means allow that any are brought in guilty and condemned by virtue of spectre evidence but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences that these persons are found guilty considering what before has been said i leave you and any man of sense to judge and determine the later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by governor phips around the same time his own wife lady mary phipss name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft began in january  this immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions due to a reprieve by phips there were no further executions phipss actions were vigorously opposed by william stoughton bancroft notes that mather considered witches among the poor and vile and ragged beggars upon earth and bancroft asserts that mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates calef places mather at the scene of the execution of george burroughs and four others who were executed after mather spoke and shows him playing a direct and influential role mr buroughs sic was carried in a cart with others through the streets of salem to execution when he was upon the ladder he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present his prayer which he concluded by repeating the lords prayer as witches were not supposed to be able to recite was so well worded and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit as was very affecting and drew tears from many so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution the accusers said the black man devil stood and dictated to him as soon as he was turned off hanged mr cotton mather being mounted upon a horse addressed himself to the people partly to declare that he mr burroughs was no ordained minister partly to possess the people of his guilt saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light and this did somewhat appease the people and the executions went on when he mr burroughs was cut down he was dragged by a halter to a hole or grave between the rocks about two feet deep his shirt and breeches being pulled off and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts he was so put in together with john willard and martha carrier that one of his hands and his chin and a foot of one of them was left uncovered posttrialsedit in the years after the trials of the principal actors in the trial whose lives are recorded after neither he nor stoughton ever admitted to any misgivings in the years after the trials he became an increasingly vehement defender of them at the request of then ltgov stoughton mather wrote wonders of the invisible world during the trials which were published in  the book contained a few of mathers sermons the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in europe he somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in return of the several ministers by defending the use of spectral evidence wonders of the invisible world appeared at the same time as increase mathers cases of conscience mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially oct th  cm letter to his uncle there are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press containing cases of conscience about witchcraft i did in my conscience think that as the humors of this people now run such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witchadvocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches considered in parcels while things as they lay in bulk with their whole dependencies were not exposed but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice  more than so produce a public  open contest with the judges who would tho beyond the intention of the worthy author  subscribers find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile mob — october   letter to his uncle john cotton the last event in mathers involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure mercy short and margaret rule boston merchant robert calef began his eightyear campaign against the influential mathers calefs book was inspired by the fear that mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of  he quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges upon reading calefs more wonders of the invisible world increase mather cottons father publicly burned the book in harvard yard poole vs uphamedit in  william frederick poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on cotton mathers role in the witch trials if anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking who got up salem witchcraft he will reply cotton mather let him try another boy who was cotton mather and the answer will come the man who was on horseback and hung witches poole was a librarian and a lover of literature including mathers magnalia and other books and tracts numbering nearly  which were never so prized by collectors as today poole announced his intention to redeem mathers name using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by charles wentworth upham salem witchcraft volumes i and ii with an account of salem village and a history of opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects which runs to almost  pages and a quick search of the name mather referring to either father son or ancestors shows that it occurs  times pooles critique in book form runs less than  pages but the name mather occurs many more times than the other book which is more than ten times as long upham shows a balanced and complicated view of cotton mather such as this first mention one of cotton mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master it flows from a heart warm with gratitude uphams book refers to robert calef no fewer than  times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by calef in the mids and stating although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions there is no ground to dispute the veracity of calef as to matters of fact he goes on to say that calefs collection of writings gave a shock to mathers influence from which it never recoveredcitation needed calef produced only the one book he is selfeffacing and apologetic for his limitations and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector poole champion of literature cannot accept calef whose faculties as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order and his book in our opinion has a reputation much beyond its merits poole refers to calef as mathers personal enemy and opens a line without discussing the character and motives of calef but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn calef upham responded to poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title referring to poole as the reviewer many of pooles arguments were addressed but both authors emphasize the importance of cotton mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence as copied in the final pages called the return of several ministers of increase mathers cases of conscience in  historian george lincoln burr sided with upham in a note on thomas brattles letter the strange suggestion of w f poole that brattle here means cotton mather himself is adequately answered by upham burr reprinted calef in full and dug deep into the historical record for information on the man and concludes that he had else any grievance against the mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think burr finds that a comparison between calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactnesscitation needed mather revivalists th century revisionedit since the poole vs upham debate several scholars have rexamined mathers reputation and his role in the witchcraft trials  cotton mather the puritan priest by barret wendall an english professor at harvard university wendall played a leading role in the mather revival but he might have been surprised to see how far the wheel turned his book often expresses agreement with upham and unlike poole he simply announces his intention to show cotton mather in a more positive light “cotton mather gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other” and some pages later “robert calef’s temper was that of the rational eighteenth century the mathers belonged rather to the sixteenth the age of passionate religious enthusiasm”  life and times of cotton mather by rev abijah p marvin published by congregational sunday school and publishing society this work tends to paraphrase cotton mather’s artfully constructed diary marvin presents a lengthy critique of robert calef  increase mather the foremost american puritan by kenneth b murdock harvard university press murdock studied under wendall and is also critical of cotton mather but in a strong desire to show increase mather in a positive light he omits much  cotton mather a bibliography by tj holmes harvard university press holmes was librarian at the william g mather library his notes are pugilistic and promather but holmes published for the first time cotton mather’s october   letter see above to his uncle opposing an end to the trials  the devil in massachusetts a modern inquiry into the salem witch trials by marion l starkey she feels that mather was not as active in the salem trials as others give him credit for she does bring up that mather did denounce torture as a way to get a confession and cautioned against the use of spectral evidence  the intellectual life of colonial new england by samuel eliot morison morison believes that mather found balance and levelthinking during the witchcraft trials he also believes that calef had an agenda against mather which stuck with him over time  selected letters of cotton mather by ken silverman louisiana state university press on page  silverman writes “actually mather had very little to do with the trials” twelve pages later he publishes for the first time to chief judge william stoughton on september   in which cotton mather writes “ i hope i can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen” and continues “i have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance”  the admirable cotton mather by james playsted wood a young adult book in the preface wood writes that a “changed attitude” began with wendall above and passed to murdock above and another colleague in the harvard english department lyman kittredge the intricate relationship of the mathers to harvard with a revisionist movement emerging from the same institution can at times give an uncomfortable aspect of history being bent to team spiritcitation needed ongoing revisionedit chadwick hansens witchcraft at salem published in  presents mather as a positive influence on the salem trials he considered mathers handling of the goodwin children to be sane and temperate that he was more concerned with helping the afflicted than witchhunting and treated the children with prayer and fasting hansen wrote that mather was a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed — or feigned confession — such as tituba and dorcas good and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in wonders of the invisible world after some others had lamented the roles they played in the executions and imprisonments mather and stoughton remained the chief defenders of the trials which diminishes the view of him as a moderate influence historian larry gregg highlights mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when mather stated the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also the very virtuous writing in the early s historian john demos imputed to mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials smallpox inoculation controversyedit the practice of smallpox inoculation as opposed to the later practice of vaccination was developed possibly in thcentury india or thcentury china spreading its reach in seventeenthcentury turkey inoculation or rather variolation involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox variola to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity by the beginning of the th century the royal society in england was discussing the practice of inoculation and the smallpox epidemic in  spurred further interest it was not until  however that england recorded its first case of inoculation early new englandedit smallpox was a serious threat in colonial america most devastating to native americans but also to angloamerican settlers new england suffered smallpox epidemics in  – and  it was highly contagious and mortality could reach as high as  percent boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in  and  during this era public authorities in massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine incoming ships were quarantined in boston harbor and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse in  mathers slave onesimus explained to mather how he had been inoculated as a child in africa mather was fascinated by the idea by july  he had read an endorsement of inoculation by dr emanuel timonius of constantinople in the philosophical transactions mather then declared in a letter to dr john woodward of gresham college in london that he planned to press bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again by  a whole generation of young bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared on april  of that year the hms seahorse arrived from the west indies carrying smallpox on board despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine eight known cases of smallpox appeared in boston by may  and by midjune the disease was spreading at an alarming rate as a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread many residents fled to outlying rural settlements the combination of exodus quarantine and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the bay colony for weeks guards were stationed at the house of representatives to keep bostonians from entering without special permission the death toll reached  in september and the selectmen powerless to stop it severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll as one response legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who under these conditions could no longer support their familiescitation needed on june   mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by timonius and jacobus pylarinus to local physicians urging them to consult about the matter he received no response next mather pleaded his case to dr zabdiel boylston who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves — one grown and one a boy all recovered in about a week boylston inoculated seven more people by midjuly the epidemic peaked in october  with  deaths by february   boston was again free from smallpox the total number of cases since april  came to  with  deaths—more than threequarters of all the deaths in boston during  meanwhile boylston had inoculated  people with six resulting deaths inoculation debateedit boylston and mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid clamour among the people of boston both boylston and mather were objects of their fury their furious obloquies and invectives which mather acknowledges in his diary bostons selectmen consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection forbade boylston from performing it again the newengland courant published writers who opposed the practice the editorial stance was that the boston populace feared that inoculation spread rather than prevented the disease however some historians notably h w brands have argued that this position was a result of the contrarian positions of editorinchief james franklin a brother of benjamin franklin public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by reverend john williams from boston who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of physick either natural or divine and therefore unlawful to those put forth in a pamphlet by dr william douglass of boston entitled the abuses and scandals of some late pamphlets in favour of inoculation of the small pox  on the qualifications of inoculations proponents douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from europe at the extreme in november  someone hurled a lighted grenade into mathers home medical oppositionedit several opponents of smallpox inoculation among them rev john williams stated that there were only two laws of physick medicine sympathy and antipathy in his estimation inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease or an antipathy toward one but the creation of one for this reason its practice violated the natural laws of medicine transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal as with most colonists williams puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life and he used the bible to state his case he quoted matthew  when jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick dr william douglass proposed a more secular argument against inoculation stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices in addition he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise according to douglass smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence one not to be undertaken lightly he believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony including that of caring for the sick they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented the only reason mather had had success in it he said was because mather had used it on children who are naturally more resilient douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection speak out he did the battle between these two prestigious adversaries douglass and mather lasted far longer than the epidemic itself and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous puritan resistanceedit generally puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments increase mather cottons father was joined by prominent pastors benjamin colman and william cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations one of the classic assumptions of the puritan mind was that the will of god was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation nevertheless williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of god and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most high he also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by god as punishment for sin and warned that attempting to shield themselves from gods fury via inoculation would only serve to provoke him more puritans found meaning in affliction and they did not yet know why god was showing them disfavor through smallpox not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand many puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art they grappled with adhering to the ten commandments with being proper church members and good caring neighbors the apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the sixth commandment – thou shalt not kill — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the bible it was not the will of god and therefore unlawful he explained that inoculation violated the golden rule because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him with the bible as the puritans source for all decisionmaking lack of scriptural evidence concerned many and williams vocally scorned mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the bible inoculation defendededit with the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day the use of quarantine and various other efforts such as balancing the bodys humors did not slow the spread of the disease as news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people by circa  smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the atlantic world mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of god and argued the procedure was not outside of puritan principles he wrote that whether a christian may not employ this medicine let the matter of it be what it will and humbly give thanks to gods good providence in discovering of it to a miserable world and humbly look up to his good providence as we do in the use of any other medicine it may seem strange that any wise christian cannot answer it and how strangely do men that call themselves physicians betray their anatomy and their philosophy as well as their divinity in their invectives against this practice the puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone both the good and the wicked yet god had provided them with the means to save themselves mather reported that from his view none that have used it ever died of the small pox tho at the same time it were so malignant that at least half the people died that were infected with it in the common way while mather was experimenting with the procedure prominent puritan pastors benjamin colman and william cooper expressed public and theological support for them the practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to firsthand experiences and personal relationships although many were initially wary of the concept it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results within their own community of ordinary citizens that it became widely utilized and supported one important change in the practice after  was regulated quarantine of innoculees the aftermathedit although mather and boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of – after overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success boylston traveled to london in  where he published his results and was elected to the royal society in  with mather formally receiving the honor two years

an abundance of unfinished writings including one entitled the biblia americana mather believed that biblia americana was the best thing he had ever written his masterwork biblia americana contained mathers thoughts and opinions on the bible and how he interpreted it biblia americana is incredibly large and mather worked on it from  until  when he died mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it people did not have to choose one or the other in biblia americana mather looked at the bible through a scientific

workedit richard mather john cotton – mather was born in boston massachusetts bay colony the son of maria née cotton and increase mather and grandson of both john cotton and richard mather all also prominent puritan ministers mather was named after his maternal grandfather john cotton he attended boston latin school where his name was posthumously added to its hall of fame and graduated from harvard in  at age  after completing his postgraduate work he joined his father as assistant pastor of bostons original north church not to be confused with the anglicanepiscopal old north church of paul revere fame in  mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church mather lived on hanover street boston – mather wrote more than  books and pamphlets and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in america he set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second and thirdgeneration puritans to return to the theological roots of puritanism whose parents had left england for the new england colonies of north america the most important of these was magnalia christi americana  which comprises seven distinct books many of which depict biographical and historical narrativescitation needed the mather tomb in copps hill cemetery mather was not known for writing in a neutral unbiased perspective many if not all of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons according to literary historian sacvan bercovitch few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did cotton mather none more clearly exemplified it explicitly or implicitly he projects himself everywhere in his writings in the most direct compensatory sense he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress he tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own his essays on the riches of christ to repay his benefactors his tracts on morality to convert his enemies his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child wife or friend mather influenced early american science in  he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant hybridization because of observations of corn varieties this observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend james petiver first my friend planted a row of indian corn that was coloured red and blue the rest of the field being planted with corn of the yellow which is the most usual color to the windward side this red and blue row so infected three or four whole rows as to communicate the same colour unto them and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth but to the leeward side no less than seven or eight rows had ye same colour communicated unto them and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off in november  mathers wife newborn twins and two yearold daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic he was twice widowed and only two of his  children survived him he died on the day after his th birthday and was buried on copps hill near old north church boyles influence on matheredit robert boyle was a huge influence throughout mathers career he read boyles the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy closely throughout the s and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it using almost identical language to boylepage needed increase matheredit mathers relationship with his father increase mather is thought by some to have been strained and difficult increase was a pastor of the north square church and president of harvard college he led an accomplished life despite cottons efforts he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father he did surpass his fathers output as a writer writing more than  books one of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials which increase mather reportedly did not support yale collegeedit cotton mather helped convince elihu yale to make a donation to a new college in new haven which became yale college salem witch trials of  the mather influenceedit pretrialsedit in  mather published memorable providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the goodwin family in boston catholic washerwoman goody glover was convicted of witchcraft and executed in this case mather had a prominent role in this case besides praying for the children which also included fasting and meditation he would also observe and record their activities the children were subject to hysterical fits which he detailed in memorable providences in his book mather argued that since there are witches and devils there are immortal souls he also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves he opposed any natural explainations for the fits he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil and he argued that spectral evidence should not be used as evidence for witchcraft robert calef was a contemporary of mather and critical of him and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the salem witch trials three years later mr cotton mather was the most active and forward of any minister in the country in those matters taking home one of the children and managing such intreagues with that child and after printing such an account of the whole in his memorable providences as conduced much to the kindling of those flames that in sir williams time threatened the devouring of this country nineteenthcentury historian charles wentworth upham shared the view that the afflicted in salem were imitating the goodwin children but he put the blame on both cotton and his father increase mather they are answerable more than almost any other men have been for the opinions of their time it was indeed a superstitious age but made much more so by their operations influence and writings beginning with increase mathers movement at the assembly of ministers in  and ending with cotton mathers dealings with the goodwin children and the account thereof which he printed and circulated far and wide for this reason then in the first place i hold those two men responsible for what is called salem witchcraft the courtedit mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning sir william phips governor of the newly chartered province of massachusetts bay appointed his lieutenant governor william stoughton as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts where he presided over the witch trials according to george bancroft mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under phips through the intervention of mathers own politically powerful father increase intercession had been made by cotton mather for the advancement of stoughton a man of cold affections proud selfwilled and covetous of distinction apparently mather saw in stoughton a bachelor who had never wed an ally for churchrelated matters bancroft quotes mathers reaction to stoughtons appointment as follows the time for a favor is come exulted cotton mather yea the set time is come mather claimed not to have attended the trials in salem although his father attended the trial of george burroughs his contemporaries calef and thomas brattle place him at the executions see below mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end if in the midst of the many dissatisfaction among us the publication of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto god for justice being so far executed among us i shall rejoyce that god is glorified mather called himself a historian not an advocate but according to one modern writer his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling martha carrier a rampant hag mather referred to george burroughs as a very puny man whose tergiversations contradictions and falsehoods made his testimony not worth consideringpage needed use of spectral evidenceedit mathers most significant influence over the trials was in composing the answer to the question of whether or not to allow spectral evidence the afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant invisible to any but themselves was tormenting them this was considered evidence of witchcraft despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held christian beliefs an opinion on the matter was sought from the most esteemed ministers of the area and mather took credit for their response when anonymously celebrating himself years later drawn up at their desire by cotton mather the younger as i have been informedpage needed on may   mather wrote to one of the judges john richards a member of his congregationpage needed expressing his support of the prosecutions but cautioning do not lay more stress on pure spectral evidence than it will bear  it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also very virtuous though i believe that the just god then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused thomas hutchinson summarized the letter the two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before reprinting the letter years later in magnalia mather notably omitted the fateful two first and the last sections the original full version of the letter called return of the several ministers was dated june   and had been reprinted in late  in the final two pages of increase mathers cases of conscience it is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument calef calls it perfectly ambidexter giving as great as greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods then cautions against them indeed the advice then given looks most like a thing of his composing as carrying both fire to increase and water to quench the conflagration regarding spectral evidence upham concludes that cotton mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it never advised its absolute exclusion but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption  and once admitted nothing could stand against it character reason common sense were swept away in a letter to an english clergyman in  boston intellectual thomas brattle criticizing the trials said of the judges use of spectral evidence the sg salem gentlemen will by no means allow that any are brought in guilty and condemned by virtue of spectre evidence but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre evidences that these persons are found guilty considering what before has been said i leave you and any man of sense to judge and determine the later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by governor phips around the same time his own wife lady mary phipss name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft began in january  this immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions due to a reprieve by phips there were no further executions phipss actions were vigorously opposed by william stoughton bancroft notes that mather considered witches among the poor and vile and ragged beggars upon earth and bancroft asserts that mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates calef places mather at the scene of the execution of george burroughs and four others who were executed after mather spoke and shows him playing a direct and influential role mr buroughs sic was carried in a cart with others through the streets of salem to execution when he was upon the ladder he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present his prayer which he concluded by repeating the lords prayer as witches were not supposed to be able to recite was so well worded and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit as was very affecting and drew tears from many so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution the accusers said the black man devil stood and dictated to him as soon as he was turned off hanged mr cotton mather being mounted upon a horse addressed himself to the people partly to declare that he mr burroughs was no ordained minister partly to possess the people of his guilt saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light and this did somewhat appease the people and the executions went on when he mr burroughs was cut down he was dragged by a halter to a hole or grave between the rocks about two feet deep his shirt and breeches being pulled off and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts he was so put in together with john willard and martha carrier that one of his hands and his chin and a foot of one of them was left uncovered posttrialsedit in the years after the trials of the principal actors in the trial whose lives are recorded after neither he nor stoughton ever admitted to any misgivings in the years after the trials he became an increasingly vehement defender of them at the request of then ltgov stoughton mather wrote wonders of the invisible world during the trials which were published in  the book contained a few of mathers sermons the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in europe he somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in return of the several ministers by defending the use of spectral evidence wonders of the invisible world appeared at the same time as increase mathers cases of conscience mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially oct th  cm letter to his uncle there are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press containing cases of conscience about witchcraft i did in my conscience think that as the humors of this people now run such a discourse going alone would not only enable the witchadvocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches considered in parcels while things as they lay in bulk with their whole dependencies were not exposed but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice  more than so produce a public  open contest with the judges who would tho beyond the intention of the worthy author  subscribers find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest mobile mob — october   letter to his uncle john cotton the last event in mathers involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure mercy short and margaret rule boston merchant robert calef began his eightyear campaign against the influential mathers calefs book was inspired by the fear that mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of  he quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges upon reading calefs more wonders of the invisible world increase mather cottons father publicly burned the book in harvard yard poole vs uphamedit in  william frederick poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on cotton mathers role in the witch trials if anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking who got up salem witchcraft he will reply cotton mather let him try another boy who was cotton mather and the answer will come the man who was on horseback and hung witches poole was a librarian and a lover of literature including mathers magnalia and other books and tracts numbering nearly  which were never so prized by collectors as today poole announced his intention to redeem mathers name using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by charles wentworth upham salem witchcraft volumes i and ii with an account of salem village and a history of opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects which runs to almost  pages and a quick search of the name mather referring to either father son or ancestors shows that it occurs  times pooles critique in book form runs less than  pages but the name mather occurs many more times than the other book which is more than ten times as long upham shows a balanced and complicated view of cotton mather such as this first mention one of cotton mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master it flows from a heart warm with gratitude uphams book refers to robert calef no fewer than  times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by calef in the mids and stating although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions there is no ground to dispute the veracity of calef as to matters of fact he goes on to say that calefs collection of writings gave a shock to mathers influence from which it never recoveredcitation needed calef produced only the one book he is selfeffacing and apologetic for his limitations and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector poole champion of literature cannot accept calef whose faculties as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order and his book in our opinion has a reputation much beyond its merits poole refers to calef as mathers personal enemy and opens a line without discussing the character and motives of calef but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn calef upham responded to poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title referring to poole as the reviewer many of pooles arguments were addressed but both authors emphasize the importance of cotton mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence as copied in the final pages called the return of several ministers of increase mathers cases of conscience in  historian george lincoln burr sided with upham in a note on thomas brattles letter the strange suggestion of w f poole that brattle here means cotton mather himself is adequately answered by upham burr reprinted calef in full and dug deep into the historical record for information on the man and concludes that he had else any grievance against the mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think burr finds that a comparison between calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactnesscitation needed mather revivalists th century revisionedit since the poole vs upham debate several scholars have rexamined mathers reputation and his role in the witchcraft trials  cotton mather the puritan priest by barret wendall an english professor at harvard university wendall played a leading role in the mather revival but he might have been surprised to see how far the wheel turned his book often expresses agreement with upham and unlike poole he simply announces his intention to show cotton mather in a more positive light “cotton mather gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other” and some pages later “robert calef’s temper was that of the rational eighteenth century the mathers belonged rather to the sixteenth the age of passionate religious enthusiasm”  life and times of cotton mather by rev abijah p marvin published by congregational sunday school and publishing society this work tends to paraphrase cotton mather’s artfully constructed diary marvin presents a lengthy critique of robert calef  increase mather the foremost american puritan by kenneth b murdock harvard university press murdock studied under wendall and is also critical of cotton mather but in a strong desire to show increase mather in a positive light he omits much  cotton mather a bibliography by tj holmes harvard university press holmes was librarian at the william g mather library his notes are pugilistic and promather but holmes published for the first time cotton mather’s october   letter see above to his uncle opposing an end to the trials  the devil in massachusetts a modern inquiry into the salem witch trials by marion l starkey she feels that mather was not as active in the salem trials as others give him credit for she does bring up that mather did denounce torture as a way to get a confession and cautioned against the use of spectral evidence  the intellectual life of colonial new england by samuel eliot morison morison believes that mather found balance and levelthinking during the witchcraft trials he also believes that calef had an agenda against mather which stuck with him over time  selected letters of cotton mather by ken silverman louisiana state university press on page  silverman writes “actually mather had very little to do with the trials” twelve pages later he publishes for the first time to chief judge william stoughton on september   in which cotton mather writes “ i hope i can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen” and continues “i have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance”  the admirable cotton mather by james playsted wood a young adult book in the preface wood writes that a “changed attitude” began with wendall above and passed to murdock above and another colleague in the harvard english department lyman kittredge the intricate relationship of the mathers to harvard with a revisionist movement emerging from the same institution can at times give an uncomfortable aspect of history being bent to team spiritcitation needed ongoing revisionedit chadwick hansens witchcraft at salem published in  presents mather as a positive influence on the salem trials he considered mathers handling of the goodwin children to be sane and temperate that he was more concerned with helping the afflicted than witchhunting and treated the children with prayer and fasting hansen wrote that mather was a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed — or feigned confession — such as tituba and dorcas good and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in wonders of the invisible world after some others had lamented the roles they played in the executions and imprisonments mather and stoughton remained the chief defenders of the trials which diminishes the view of him as a moderate influence historian larry gregg highlights mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when mather stated the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent but also the very virtuous writing in the early s historian john demos imputed to mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials smallpox inoculation controversyedit the practice of smallpox inoculation as opposed to the later practice of vaccination was developed possibly in thcentury india or thcentury china spreading its reach in seventeenthcentury turkey inoculation or rather variolation involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox variola to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity by the beginning of the th century the royal society in england was discussing the practice of inoculation and the smallpox epidemic in  spurred further interest it was not until  however that england recorded its first case of inoculation early new englandedit smallpox was a serious threat in colonial america most devastating to native americans but also to angloamerican settlers new england suffered smallpox epidemics in  – and  it was highly contagious and mortality could reach as high as  percent boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in  and  during this era public authorities in massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine incoming ships were quarantined in boston harbor and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse in  mathers slave onesimus explained to mather how he had been inoculated as a child in africa mather was fascinated by the idea by july  he had read an endorsement of inoculation by dr emanuel timonius of constantinople in the philosophical transactions mather then declared in a letter to dr john woodward of gresham college in london that he planned to press bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again by  a whole generation of young bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared on april  of that year the hms seahorse arrived from the west indies carrying smallpox on board despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine eight known cases of smallpox appeared in boston by may  and by midjune the disease was spreading at an alarming rate as a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread many residents fled to outlying rural settlements the combination of exodus quarantine and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the bay colony for weeks guards were stationed at the house of representatives to keep bostonians from entering without special permission the death toll reached  in september and the selectmen powerless to stop it severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll as one response legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who under these conditions could no longer support their familiescitation needed on june   mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by timonius and jacobus pylarinus to local physicians urging them to consult about the matter he received no response next mather pleaded his case to dr zabdiel boylston who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves — one grown and one a boy all recovered in about a week boylston inoculated seven more people by midjuly the epidemic peaked in october  with  deaths by february   boston was again free from smallpox the total number of cases since april  came to  with  deaths—more than threequarters of all the deaths in boston during  meanwhile boylston had inoculated  people with six resulting deaths inoculation debateedit boylston and mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid clamour among the people of boston both boylston and mather were objects of their fury their furious obloquies and invectives which mather acknowledges in his diary bostons selectmen consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection forbade boylston from performing it again the newengland courant published writers who opposed the practice the editorial stance was that the boston populace feared that inoculation spread rather than prevented the disease however some historians notably h w brands have argued that this position was a result of the contrarian positions of editorinchief james franklin a brother of benjamin franklin public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by reverend john williams from boston who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of physick either natural or divine and therefore unlawful to those put forth in a pamphlet by dr william douglass of boston entitled the abuses and scandals of some late pamphlets in favour of inoculation of the small pox  on the qualifications of inoculations proponents douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from europe at the extreme in november  someone hurled a lighted grenade into mathers home medical oppositionedit several opponents of smallpox inoculation among them rev john williams stated that there were only two laws of physick medicine sympathy and antipathy in his estimation inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease or an antipathy toward one but the creation of one for this reason its practice violated the natural laws of medicine transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal as with most colonists williams puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life and he used the bible to state his case he quoted matthew  when jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick dr william douglass proposed a more secular argument against inoculation stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices in addition he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise according to douglass smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence one not to be undertaken lightly he believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony including that of caring for the sick they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented the only reason mather had had success in it he said was because mather had used it on children who are naturally more resilient douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection speak out he did the battle between these two prestigious adversaries douglass and mather lasted far longer than the epidemic itself and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous puritan resistanceedit generally puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments increase mather cottons father was joined by prominent pastors benjamin colman and william cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations one of the classic assumptions of the puritan mind was that the will of god was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation nevertheless williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of god and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most high he also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by god as punishment for sin and warned that attempting to shield themselves from gods fury via inoculation would only serve to provoke him more puritans found meaning in affliction and they did not yet know why god was showing them disfavor through smallpox not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand many puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art they grappled with adhering to the ten commandments with being proper church members and good caring neighbors the apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the sixth commandment – thou shalt not kill — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the bible it was not the will of god and therefore unlawful he explained that inoculation violated the golden rule because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him with the bible as the puritans source for all decisionmaking lack of scriptural evidence concerned many and williams vocally scorned mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the bible inoculation defendededit with the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day the use of quarantine and various other efforts such as balancing the bodys humors did not slow the spread of the disease as news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people by circa  smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the atlantic world mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of god and argued the procedure was not outside of puritan principles he wrote that whether a christian may not employ this medicine let the matter of it be what it will and humbly give thanks to gods good providence in discovering of it to a miserable world and humbly look up to his good providence as we do in the use of any other medicine it may seem strange that any wise christian cannot answer it and how strangely do men that call themselves physicians betray their anatomy and their philosophy as well as their divinity in their invectives against this practice the puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone both the good and the wicked yet god had provided them with the means to save themselves mather reported that from his view none that have used it ever died of the small pox tho at the same time it were so malignant that at least half the people died that were infected with it in the common way while mather was experimenting with the procedure prominent puritan pastors benjamin colman and william cooper expressed public and theological support for them the practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to firsthand experiences and personal relationships although many were initially wary of the concept it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results within their own community of ordinary citizens that it became widely utilized and supported one important change in the practice after  was regulated quarantine of innoculees the aftermathedit although mather and boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of – after overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success boylston traveled to london in  where he published his results and was elected to the royal society in  with mather formally receiving the honor two years

celestial within the text of the almanac the positions and motions of these celestial bodies which he must have calculated by handpage needed the biblia americanaedit when mather died he left behind an abundance of unfinished writings including one entitled the biblia americana mather believed that biblia americana was the best thing he had ever written his masterwork biblia americana contained mathers thoughts and opinions on the bible and how he interpreted it biblia americana is incredibly large and mather worked on it from  until  when he died mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it people did not have to choose one or the other in biblia americana mather looked at the bible through a scientific perspective completely opposite to his perspective in the christian philosopher in which he approached science in a religious manner pillars of saltedit mathers first published sermon printed in  concerned the execution of james morgan convicted of murder thirteen years later mather published the sermon in a compilation along with other similar works called pillars of salt magnalia christi americanaedit magnalia christi americana considered mathers greatest work was published in  when he was  the book includes several biographies of saintsvague and describes the process of the new england settlement in this context saints does not refer to the canonized saints of the catholic church but to those puritan divines about whom mather is writing it comprises seven total books including pietas in patriam the life of his excellency sir william phips originally published anonymously in london in  despite being one of mathers bestknown works many have openly criticized itby whom labeling it as hard to follow and understand and poorly paced and organized however other critics have praised mathers work citing it as one of the best efforts at properly documenting the establishment of america and growth of the people the christian philosopheredit in  mather published the christian philosopher the first systematic book on science published in america mather attempted to show how newtonian science and religion were in harmony it was in part based on robert boyles the christian virtuoso  mather reportedly took inspiration from hayy ibn yaqdhan by the thcentury islamic philosopher abu bakr ibn tufailcitation needed despite condemning the mahometans as infidels mather viewed the novels protagonist hayy as a model for his ideal christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist mather viewed hayy as a noble savage and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the native american indians in order to convert them to puritan christianity

product descriptionproduct detailsa sermon preached by jonathan edwards to his enfield connecticut congregation in july  sinners in the hands of an angry god is particularly noted for its vivid descriptions of the torments of hell and mankinds natural depravity at the same time it was also an appeal to mans need for salvation and a reminder of the agonies that awaited the unreformed coming
