managed futures strategy fund enhancements to the altegris managed futures strategy fund news provided by altegris may    et share this article la jolla calif may   prnewswire  altegris advisors a provider of premiere alternative investments is announcing enhancements to the altegris managed futures strategy fund tickers mftax mftix mftcx mftox in an effort to provide current and future investors with increased transparency lower costs improved tax efficiency and the potential for greater diversification  altegris has transitioned the fund to an allocation model with investment strategies pursued via direct allocation to managers the fund is an activelymanaged mutual fund that invests in financial and commodity futures markets seeks to achieve positive absolute returns in rising and falling equity markets and has the potential to dampen portfolio volatility  altegris advisors now allocates fund assets using a simpler and more streamlined process by which multiple managers trade directly for the fund via subadvisory and trading advisory arrangements  the transition has no impact on fund management fees which are unchanged but are expected to reduce fund operating expenses and remove imbedded costs and fees associated with the previous allocation method  as a result altegris has engaged seven new managers to pursue strategies on behalf of the fund including millburn ridgefield corporation qms capital management gsa capital partners crabel capital management phase capital three rock capital management and centurion investment management as a pioneer in managed futures delivering diversifying strategies to institutional and retail audiences for over fifteen years we recognize that transparency low cost and improved tax efficiency are of the utmost importance to investors said matt osborne cio at altegris and portfolio manager of the altegris managed futures strategy fund as a result of these enhancements were pleased to offer one of

markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards these risks are magnified in emerging markets the funds use of derivatives such as futures swaps structured notes and options
