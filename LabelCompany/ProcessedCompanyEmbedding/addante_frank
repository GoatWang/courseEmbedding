is founder and chairman of the rubicon project a realtime trading platform for online ads a fivetime entrepreneur he sold two companies and took a third public he is the author of founderblogcom frankaddante founder rubicon projectfrankaddante  comments credit the best product wins  period with a great product comes great customers and with customers comes revenue and profit which in turn can be used to build more great products  its a continuous cycle thats why i believe so strongly in a productdriven organization  that is a company that focuses all functions on the product  sales and marketing become the channels to take that product to market and everything else in the organizationfinance human resources itare there to support the product and those who work on it in a productdriven organization management teams oversee products as if they are each independent businesses  a product manager is like the ceo of the product the engineering lead like the cto and the top marketer the cmo  each one needs dedicated resources for his respective functions and needs control over those resources to drive the plan  together as a product leadership team they live and breathe their product every day  the product is their life their passion this team measures its product just like a standalone business  it strives to meet and balance shortterm revenue and profit goals as well as longterm strategic objectives   just like a healthy toplevel management team its members all need to be in constant communication and always  in sync driving to the same goals  they may initially differ on direction but always need to be committed to executing the same plan  they need to work together as a tight unitalways committed to each other always working together  i would never walk into a board meeting out of sync with my management team and would never point a finger at a member of my team in a board meeting a product leadership team needs to behave the same way scaling and turning one product into multiple products sold in multiple regions is the challenge  great companies master this average companies grow beyond one product and those who lose sight of it fail  if you try to manage multiple products with a horizontal company structure sales engineering product management and marketing are separate silos youll force decisionmaking in two directions up to the top of those department and across to the product leads  no one will have clear ownership and autonomy becomes impossible its also very difficult for a company to grow from a single product to multiple products if the company also has to shift from a horizontal organization to one that has multiple product leadership teams  the challenge will always be decentralizing a common platform or code base and assigning team members who wear multiple hats to one team  if you wait for that all to untangle youll never get there  rip it apart make the commitment to a productbyproduct managed organization and you will force untangling to happen great companies like amazon google and apple have adopted productdriven structures very successfully  jeff bezos founder and ceo of amazon walked into the office one day and demanded that everything be separated and run as an independent service the team at apple that built the itouch is a separate team than the one that built the iphone  though they appear to be similar products the itouch team woke up every day thinking about how it could get more people to buy and use the itouch more often  that teams members likely thought about video music entertainment games which resulted in the creation of the appstore  meanwhile the iphone team likely thought about battery life wireless network connectivity and email and calendar integration  if these were the same products i doubt apple would have built the iphone as quickly as it did and the iphone probably wouldnt have been able to launch with the appstore  the two teams would have iterated on original products and in the face of competitive pressure would have been slower to take big leaps  instead the two products helped each other ironically the itouch and the iphone are also competitors  the iphones sales cannibalized the itouch  but all in all apple as a company won and is now the most valuable technology company in the world known for building the greatest products  the perfect example of a productdriven organization the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jun   frank addante crossing the

lunchroom his unassuming demeanor refreshing candor and casual attire do not telegraph the substantial influence he has had as an innovator in his industry addante’s company rubicon project has rapidly become a leader in the juggernaut of digital advertising with more than  trillion bid requests processed every month however the yearold chicago native is a traditionalist to the core to hear him tell it the path to his success has been paved with the simple masonry of “good oldfashioned hard work” the company’s playa vista offices feature an open floor plan that feels like a giant collaborative think tank there are no cloistered vip offices spacious halls are lined with walls declaring the company’s core values which center on people product and customers and glassencased conference rooms pay tribute to trailblazing innovators such as nikola tesla johannes gutenberg alan turing and thomas edison at the center of all this activity is a conglomeration of colorful graphic display screens that track the realtime transactions and algorithms bringing to mind a hybrid of nasdaq and starship command center quite simply addante is doing for advertising what others have done for a number of other services – from booking a flight to buying concert tickets – seamlessly rolling it into the world of automation with its advertising automation cloud platform rubicon project has made it ridiculously easy to buy and sell ad space in all available online capacities and he doesn’t plan on stopping there “our vision was to start with digital advertising” he says “but our mission is to automate all advertising” “we’re a bit behind the scenes” he continues “we’re the first company to come along and connect over  advertiser brands with  million users there’s no other technology platform or company that reaches more users on the internet” in  rubicon project passed google as the no  company in terms of internet audience reach with more than  percent of the us audience being exposed to its customers’ ads the company counts  of the top  ranked websites as users of its platform including time inc wall street journal and tribune company photos by zach lipp with such substantial facts and figures to corroborate his vision addante is a compelling pitchman for rubicon project’s ambitious mission a college dropout who studied electrical and computer engineering addante is yet another example of tech success stories bill gates steve jobs and mark zuckerberg are a few notable others who have proven that academic accolades are not a necessary path to reach the pinnacle of business prosperity after dropping out of college addante left chicago a city “not known for its innovation” he admits and landed in los angeles he quickly made an impact on the tech landscape before moving north to silicon valley in  because at the time la didn’t have as much access to venture capital “the myth is that there wasn’t as much talent here” he recalls “there’s a ton of talent here in los angeles” addante continues “la’s been a great source of innovation we just need to shine a light on it if you think about innovation in the entertainment industry a new movie is like a new company” addante returned to los angeles a couple years later and is a staunch supporter of the region’s wealth of innovators – locally grown as well as those attracted by the quality of higher education southern california offers keeping brilliant people in the region however can be a challenge due to misconceptions about where the opportunities lie “there’s this huge brain drain where we’ve got these great universities where engineers are coming to southern california and then they leave they go to silicon valley they’re not even aware there are engineering jobs available at companies here” the reality is that there are “hundreds of startups being created here every year” in  rubicon project passed google as the no  company in terms of internet audience reach with more than  percent of the us audience being exposed to its customers’ ads his advice for the young entrepreneur keep it simple coming from addante – a man who has launched six companies resulting in one ipo two acquisitions and a combined market value in excess of  billion – that seems like a contradictory proposition “don’t overcomplicate things” he advises “companies are more likely to fail from indigestion than from digestion and be persistent you have to see through walls and see around corners” he considers his management style “adaptive” admitting some people would label that as “inconsistent” yet for all his “realtime decisioning” addante is a pragmatist “i don’t believe in ‘gut’ feelings” addante says “i do have gut feelings but they’re all data driven” asked what his process is for deciding what projects are worth pursuing – and to what degree – he says there are three questions he asks himself when evaluating an idea “why do i need it why do i need your idea specifically and the third which is the most difficult” he summarizes is “why do i need it right now not six months ago and not six months from now” with that kind of precision drive and vision frank addante will continue to be a force with which to be reckoned frank addante founder ceo chief product architect  rubicon project age  residence hermosa beach education electrical  computer engineering

and founder frank addantefrank addante  twitter see also  accessories that’ll help you get more out of your macbook why you should take advantage of this widely ignored part of amazon to save money jordan spieth won the open championship after his caddie saved him from making a major mistake rubicon project the programmatic advertising company that went public last year acquired torontobased search and ad regargeting company chango on tuesday for approximately  million in cash and stock but primarily stock torontobased chango specializes in intent marketing mixing information from search queries with behavioral contextual the kind of content a web user is consuming and advertiser data to allow brands to better target their ads as adexchanger points out chango gives rubicon project which originally started out as a supplysideplatform  or ssp  to help publishers and app developers monetize their content more clout on the other side of the market the buyerside rubicon project itself says chango will open up an incremental  billion intent marketing revenue opportunity we spoke to rubicon projects founder and ceo frank addante over the phone to dig into why rubicon project is bolstering up more on the buyside now and how its ad tech stack stands up to the likes of google and facebook which are rapidly building up or acquiring their stacks on both sides of the digital ad market too — serving both publishers and app developers on one side and the advertisers agencies and the other adtech companies in the ecosystem like demandsideplatformsdsps that serve them this transcript has been lightly edited for brevity business insider chango is an interesting acquisition for you as its on the buyside of the ad market rather than the sellside is this a pivot for rubicon project frank addante it’s actually not a pivot at all our mission from day one at the company has been to automate the buying and selling of advertising and from day one we’ve had technologies that we’ve built for both buyers and sellers initially it was about connecting publishers and ad networks through ad network optimization then we pioneered real time bidding and that led to the creation of dsps demandsideplatforms then a couple of years ago we launched our direct orders product which enabled buyers and sellers to transact directly with each other they also have the ability to use a dsp in that transaction so we have a history from day one we’ve been developing technologies for both buyers and sellers so this is very much in line with that vision and that plan bi ok youve worked on the buyside before but most of your revenue is sell side and that can be a difficult place to make money saas software as a service can be a difficult place to make money and as a youre a public company you need to show that you’ve a longterm growth strategy and wall street loves high margins as well there’s one interesting theory that the idea of saas in the adtech market is a dying breed do you any thoughts on that rubicon project ringing the opening bell on the new york stock exchange to celebrate its ipo in april rubicon projectfa laughs there are always conspiracy theorists out there so first our business is obviously very healthy you can see that very clearly in our financials comments about most of our revenue coming from the seller side we actually havent disclosed and don’t disclose how much of our revenue comes from the buyer piece and seller piece they do come from both to give a bit of perspective a few years back we had acquired a company called fox audience networks a company we acquired from fox part of news corporation it was a fairly large acquisition at the time and a lot of people were confused by that because fox audience networks was effectively perceived to be an ad network for myspace and news corp and fox and a bunch of other companies but we acquired that company for their technology scale and their team  those three things really led to a lot of the success we had introducing products like real time bidding or direct orders into the market and those were technologies we made available and for all buyers and sellers in our market publishers application developers the dsps the ad networks — we had the technology at the company at the point in marketplace chango founder and ceo chris sukornyklinkedinchango is exactly the same chango has built incredible technology in intent marketing and intent marketing dollars today are primarily directed towards search a lot of people when they think of search they think of the ads that show up next to search results but a large portion of search is actually going to  keywords on pages content on the page the intent for us is to make those capabilities available to all buyers and all sellers in our marketplace including the dsps ad networks and the agencies what this deal does is it gives us the ability to bring this technology from search into premium advertising we see it as a  billion dollar incremental market and it accelerates what we already have in this area it accelerates our buyer technology by more than a year there are  people in the chango team and that accelerates our hires quite a bit as well as the customer relationships sixty of the fortune  advertisers are on their platform today and they are now part of rubicon project marketplace bi how does your adtech stack compare to the rest of the market fa i think that its fair to say that we’ve established a leadership position us and google are the two largest exchanges in the market with google  they are starting to try to service themselves they are a major publisher and app developer whereas we’ve built our technology and our platform for the rest of the market where we are focused on trying to power an open marketplace google has invested billions of dollars in buying doubleclick invite media admeld to try to put together the stack whereas we’ve built the stack organically  our exchange tech is very strong our seller cloud is very strong and our buyer cloud is  an area in which we are accelerating and that part of the business has got more and more clout bi facebook is also considerably building up its adtech stack theres the rumor its launching a dsp and its expanding atlas do you credibly think you can stay the number two to google for long brian boland is leading facebooks adtech effortsmichael setobusiness insiderfa by the way we are not saying we are number two we are aiming for number one with google but there’s certainly room for a couple of winners in this space facebook has built an outstanding business obviously  they are trying to generate revenue on their own property and theyre doing a good job in doing that but they have got to solve their monetization needs first before they focus on the rest of the market i think that’s actually what they’re doing which makes a lot of sense i think for them to try to get into realtimebidding or an exchange or a marketplace for the rest of the market is a huge huge leap for them to make if they were to move in that direction i think they would be more likely to be a buyer like google google is one of our largest customers i look at facebook more like a partner or a customer see also theres something weird happening at  million adtech startup radiumone and the way we found out about it is even stranger
