executive officer alan urban  chief financial officer analysts scott billeadeau  walrus partners operator good afternoon everyone welcome to research solutions fiscal first quarter  earnings call for the quarter ended september   my name is ben and i will be your operator today joining us for today’s presentation is research solutions’ president and ceo peter derycz and the company cfo alan urban following their remarks we will open the call for your questions then before we conclude today’s call ill provide the necessary cautions regarding the forwardlooking statements made by management i will also provide information regarding the company’s use of nongaap financial information i would like to remind everyone that todays call will be recorded and it will be made available for replay via a link in the investors section on the company’s website now i’d like to turn the call over to research solutions’ president and ceo mr peter derycz please proceed sir peter derycz thank you everyone for joining us today to discuss our results for our first quarter of fiscal  during the quarter we continue to focus on selling and delivering saas platform deployments of our cloudbased research intelligence products and services our progress with platforms continued to gain momentum in fact we realized a substantial increase in the number of platform deployments by quarter end our premium platform deployments totaled  which were up  from the previous quarter and nearly three times more than the same quarter last year and in addition to transaction revenue they generate highmargin annual recurring subscription revenue our annual recurring revenue from platform subscriptions was  up by nearly a third over the previous quarter and more than double over the same year ago quarter so we are very excited about how this new business line is developing and the direction it is taking us while our transaction revenue is still many times greater than platform revenue platform gross margin ticked up even higher this quarter to  which is about four times that of transactions at  i should also point out that while transactions represent fairly reliable repeat revenue platforms generate even more predicable recurring revenue so our growth in platform deployments and subscriptions is demonstrating stronger leverage in our business model during the quarter we also continued to see our customer acquisition efforts maintain a plus percent closing rate when our solution is evaluated against the competition further in most instances when it comes to platform sales we have virtually no competition except for a customers homegrown system and these systems are inefficient and costly and certainly far less useful and capable than our offerings now before i delve more into our operational progress for the quarter and our outlook for the new fiscal year id like to turn the call over to our cfo alan urban who will walk us through some of the financial details for the quarter alan alan urban thank you peter and good afternoon everyone earlier today we issued a press release with the results for our fiscal first quarter  ended september   a copy of the release is available for viewing and can be downloaded from the investor relations section of our website please note that all quarterly comparisons i will be making today are to the same yearago quarter in fiscal  unless otherwise noted as of our last reporting period we began reporting results from article galaxy saas platform subscriptions and article galaxy transactions separately platform subscriptions provide premium access to our research intelligence products and services on an annual commitment basis while transactions primarily represent customer article purchases conducted via both paid premium subscriptions and free standard platform access so now looking on to our income statement our platform subscription revenue increased  to  which was driven primarily by  increase in platform deployments the quarter ended with platform annual recurring revenue up  to  please see todays press release for how we define and how we use this nongaap term transaction revenue increased  to  million driven primarily by a  increase in active customer accounts underpinning these results was a  increase in customer accounts to  with the number of corporate customer up  to  and academic customers up  to  all together these customers drove article galaxy transactions up  to more than  revenue generated by our legacy business reprints and eprints declined  to  million in the quarter the decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in order volume which typically fluctuates from periodtoperiod depending upon customer marketing budgets and the publication of journal articles that match customer requirements total revenue in the quarter declined  to  million and this was primarily due to the decline in reprints and eprints revenue now in terms of our gross profit and margin performance gross profit from platform subscriptions was up  to  with related gross margin increasing from  to  gross profit from transactions was up  to  million for the quarter with related gross margin declining from  to  reprints and eprints gross profit declined  to  for the quarter with related gross margin declining from  to  total gross profit in the first fiscal quarter declined  to  million with total gross margin increasing from  to  our total operating expenses increased by  to  million for the quarter the increase was primarily due to greater personnel costs travel expenses and consulting fees as we further expand our sales force and technology personnel to support increased platform sales and deployments now in terms of the bottom line our net loss totaled  or negative  per diluted share as compared to a net loss of  or negative  per diluted share in the same year ago quarter the increase in net loss was largely due to increased operating expenses in support of our platform sales and deployments as previously described negative adjusted ebitda totaled  versus a negative adjusted ebitda of  in the same year ago quarter please see todays press release for how we define and use this nongaap term now moving on to the balance sheet cash and equivalents at quarter end totaled  million versus  million at june   there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank which provides for the lesser of  million or  of eligible accounts receivable overall our balance sheet continues to remain very clean with cash receivables and prepaid expenses comprising nearly all of our assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses representing nearly all of our liabilities and we have no long term liabilities or debt now with that this completes our financial summary id like to turn the call back over to peter peter peter derycz thank you alan now from an operational perspective over the course of the last year we have continue to make strong and steady progress enhancing our cloudbased saas research intelligence platform numerous new features and capabilities have made our platform a more engaging and indispensable tool for corporate and academic researchers and scientists around the world our relentless drive for improvements and enhancements has sustained our enviable position as far and away the worldclass leader in our space the growth in our customer numbers and platform deployments reveals that everything were doing is also stimulating greater user engagement with this leading to more transactions and more valuable transactions per user as well as greater monetization within the platform more importantly all of this is driving strong growth in our high margin platform sales which has the effect of making our solutions even that much more stickier were also now appealing to an increasingly wider audience of small to mediumsized businesses that is companies with up to  employees and particularly firms who have been using homegrown systems and methods for accessing stm information and managing their journal subscriptions our cloudbased saas research intelligence platform which provides premium access and custom feature sets is extraordinarily powerful and unique it offers a very compelling value proposition for these organizations while our customers have long included more than  of the worlds top  pharma companies we are seeing our subscriptionbased platform increasingly being adopted by this broader market of small to mediumsized corporations this trend is beneficially reducing our concentration risks in terms of having mostly large customers although to be sure maintaining a marquee customer list of top pharma and other major corporations help to provide excellent references and assurances for smaller organization and helps them feel confident in adopting our platform as a single source for stm research our compelling value proposition is also continue to attract new industry partnerships in the first quarter this included a new partnership with the leading research metrics provider altmetric we have integrated altmetric badges to the scholarly content delivered by our paid addon article galaxy widget the badges provide ataglance indication of the attention individual journal articles are receiving from the mainstream and social media public policy documents blogs wikipedia scholarly forums and like we believe being able to see who is saying what about a piece of research will be incredibly valuable to our platform users who are trying to understand how an items of scholarly work is being received by the research community the addition of altmetric badges will make our platform not only more powerful but also more unique and how it help accelerate research being pursued by rd based organization their adoption of our platform also reaffirms how our ability to innovate with new features and enhancement have made it the clear choice for any research intensive organizations working for an easier and more cost effective way to access scientific technical and medical information paying careful attention to our clients needs and listening to their feedback has also help us to create new ways to monetize our platform and increase greater use per user as well as deliver new ways of information access that build upon our core strength and proprietary ip so looking ahead we plan to continue to reinvest our available resources into enhancing our platform and preparing it for its next stage of growth and development as we announced earlier this year we focused on developing and delivering new softwareasaservice offerings in calendar year  that will provide a bestinclass research platform for businesses and business professionals our existing transactional research retrieval services will continue to be available as one of the many new integrated product features and service offerings within the new platform these new saas offerings will represent a natural evolution for us they will allow us to expand into multiple new and lucrative market segments including further tapping the larger smb market our existing blue chip customer base will also benefit from the new saas offerings allowing us to further build upon these valuable relationships which will help us to shape a blockbuster research intelligence platform but to be sure given the already existing superiority of our research intelligence platform and our great competitive lead how we leverage and maximize our sales and marketing resources to drive growth both domestically and internationally continue to be our most important challenge we have to build out and train up sales forces thats more oriented towards platform sales and which have international sales capabilities in the first quarter we made good progress in this regard and this effort will continue throughout the fiscal year we are also making progress and expanding our reseller or var network which our platform offering is helping to support since its offers them like us an attractive recurring revenue stream such valuedadded reseller relationships can also be a first multiplier for us not only in terms of sales and upsells and renewals but also in terms of after sales support and training this can be especially helpful to us as we look to penetrate certain international regional markets where local language support is important and not only for localized sales and support but also for future localized product development certainly broadening our international presence is an important aspect to our subscription business model and one that is important to consider when evaluating our future prospects this is because at the core of our platform is a virtual store that is open  hours a day seven days a week and accessible on virtually any computer or mobile device by anyone anywhere in the world but to be sure reaching out and servicing more international customers and vars does not require setting up offices or deploying other regional resources so as we grow our sales and marketing teams and support staff we believe we can continue to stay a relatively lean and efficient organization all of this highlights the strong leverage and scalability in our model and the few barriers we face in terms of achieving greater global expansion and revenue growth now as we continue throughout the fiscal year we expect to maintain healthy growth in transactions and saas platform deployments with this continuing to be driven by our uniqueness which attracts both increased customer usage and new customer wins we are very excited by our growth prospects and by the technology we are bringing to market now with that lets open the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from scott billeadeau of walrus partners please go ahead scott billeadeau hi guys in your press release you show that the asp on the platform sales was down  im wondering if you could give us a little feel for what we should expect further trend of that and kind of what is the asp for that or whats your expectations going forward alan urban yes it dropped a bit on average it was more than made up by the number of platforms being deployed i think the reason for that is we have been expanding our sales and marketing team and with one of the objectives being go get some platform sold and do it in the smaller mediumsized business market so with that i think some of sales came in little bit lower than average on price but we expect it to continue the same as it was before or even grow as we add more features to the platform scott billeadeau okay and then you did mentioned to maybe engage some vars to help you and will the vars help on platform sales as well and kind of what do you have to get up to – what you have give up to engage in the vars or what can we expect in terms of what nets back to you guys peter derycz yes i think there are some pros and cons in vars but the reality of the matter is we have a limited sales and marketing force were expanding it a lot but we want to have multiplier effect and that what some of these vars bring to the table so were going to be basically adding lot more feet on the ground that are really focused on selling the platform and along with that sort of comes more transaction another benefit to that is it doesnt cost a penny to add a var we spend some time training recruiting and helping them reach out to their customers in their market but other that we were not hiring people to work at these vars we are not paying them any kind of advanced royalties or fees for that so thats a good point we are giving commissions but we have a high gross margin product now that we can actually pay decent commissions from but yes so i think there are some more pros than cons in that and the objective here is to really expand our presence in the market scott billeadeau okay great and then one last question just on what you expect on the transaction side for kind of sustainable gross margins there over time i think kind of been running ish or so is that kind of what you should expect as more goes through the platform is it better for transaction gross margin or about the same whats your sense there alan urban hi scott this is alan yes we expect that to stay floating around the  level at the  mark as you indicated the more transactions that flow through the better because we do get to scale some of those fixed cost in there and there are few different components in the transaction section that affect margin basically there is our labor cost and that tends to perform relatively well we are not concerned there then there is the discount we receive from publishers and that has been trending down over time and then there is the sort of onetime implementation fees that we sometime get when we implement larger accounts and those can  in a quarter can add up maybe   so sometimes those are transactional and sometime we see them one quarter and we don’t see them in another quarter and that tends to affect the number as well but probably the biggest of those three would be the publisher discount and that is trending down  has trended down over time so now that we have some more cash to work with were going to see if we can get that number back up again by offering prepayments to our publishing partners and usually when that happens we get an associated discount so we are going to see – were going to trying to work on that trying to get a backup again scott billeadeau and then one followup as you have success again were early here with platform when can you  if or when can you kind of benefit or go back to publishers and go look where to put platform in these big places that you may have any leverage whatsoever with them is that a pipe dream if you get a big enough footprint that you can  you got publishers coming to you to get access or is that kind of pie in the sky stuff peter derycz i don’t think thats all pie in the sky i think there is a couple of points to leverage as we grow and become standard solution in the market place one is what you mentioned i think our publisher partners are looking for us to help them actually reach new markets and the smb market has been a difficult market for a lot of publishers to get into so theyre pretty excited about that and i think we may have some leverage on that side the other point of leverage on pricing on transaction is that as we become more of a standard solution i think well have a little bit of leverage on just how we price product to our customers and then of course as the  really great  really great thing about this whole thing is that the platforms  the trends there are positive and i think and as we improve that platform we’ll have some leverage to actually affect the pricing of the platform as well scott billeadeau thanks guys alan urban thank you scott operator operator instructions we have a followup question also from scott billeadeau of walrus partners please go ahead scott billeadeau i guess it is just us guys so just one other question on you mentioned and i know its broader market youre going to but you mentioned to businesses the smb world is there something else youre thinking of in  in terms of what youre going to put on the platform or is that just based on using vars you can spread what you have to a lot more maybe you could flush that out just a touch peter derycz yes so we are doing a lot of – going into calendar  were going to doing a lot more marketing to smbs the vars are going to help there because theyre going to be reaching out with the same campaigns out to their customers we have a planned redesign of our user interface so were taking – what we have now is account level customization and really taking that to the user level so that we think is going to help penetrate some of these smbs because theres going to be lot more flexibility in the platform to accommodate the needs of the smaller organization scott billeadeau and kind of keeping with the stm content or does that require any new content at all peter derycz stm is our core and thats what one of the reason people come to us is that we provide efficient access to that kind of content as we reach out to the smbs were finding that the same stm users have lot of different roles inside these companies so were finding that were going to probably going to be adding things like news and patent information as well so that we can help the platform useable to the management and other intellectual property or players in the knowledge space within these smbs scott billeadeau is there any content again im sure youre pretty early on here but is there any feedback as we need to get this content to be successful there is there anything jumping up and down and were going to need to go get this contents set to help on that market in that marketplace peter derycz well i think the core and the most difficult part of the whole thing is the stm content scott billeadeau we got there peter derycz we sort of got that well figure out and are the sort of the solution for that type of content i wont say theres anything like jumping up and down but we do have a new front end coming out in the future so like i mentioned theres going to be some other types of content or ways of delivering content that are going to be useful to us like i mentioned new updates altering that type of things is going to be a core part of the content  of platform coming up in the next edition its more about alerts and helping people keep track of whats going on out there in terms of science or news about scientific trends or even companies within science scott billeadeau okay all right thats all ive got guys i appreciated thanks much peter derycz okay operator there are no further questions at this time operator instructions this concludes our questionanswersession id now like to turn the call back over to mr peter derycz for his closing remarks peter

investors search for interview with peter derycz from research solutions inc april   mariusz skonieczny interviews  mariusz skonieczny classic value investors welcome to classic value investors my name is mariusz skonieczny today i have with me peter derycz who is the ceo of research solutions inc peter thank you for joining me peter derycz research solutions inc thank you mariusz skonieczny classic value investors can you talk a little bit about what research solutions does because it is not that easy to understand it if you are not in the business peter derycz research solutions inc our current business is like amazon’s book and ebooks business we provide ondemand access to scientific technical and medical information primarily to research based companies like pharma companies and biotech companies and what we do is we have a platform called article galaxy which is a platform where you can get access to anything that has ever been published in hard sciences in the same way you can buy books and ebooks from amazon we do the same thing with article galaxy but in scientific literature space and that’s sort of our platform now and it is growing and it is becoming more of a software too as well so we are adding more additional layers to make it more valuable mariusz skonieczny classic value investors the organizations that use article galaxy as you mentioned are research oriented organizations they pay for it as if they were buying books they don’t pay for it on a monthly basis am i correct peter derycz research solutions inc you are correct now we have a bit of transition going on in the company where we are introducing another revenue line to the mix that we talk about it sometimes on the earnings calls we do sell exactly like you said – articles on a oneoffbasis just like amazon sells books and ebooks and we are also layering on what we call platform sales so we are selling the system itself as a software solution and i guess one way to look at it is how amazon charges you platform fees for amazon prime which gets you a bunch of other privileges we are doing the same thing so if anyone wants us to turn on certain advanced features within article galaxy we will charge the customer an additional annual platform fee for that mariusz skonieczny classic value investors is this new platform something new or is this something that you had for many years peter derycz research solutions inc we have been building the article galaxy platform for a few years now i guess what’s new is really that fact that it’s gotten so advanced and has some really great features and productivity tools in it that it is worth for companies to start paying for the platform so the platform fee part of it is new the platform itself we have been building it for a few years now mariusz skonieczny classic value investors i see  what about the second part of your business that you have i believe it is called eprints peter derycz research solutions inc we have a legacy business line which was actually our first business line it is called reprints and eprints business line and we break down the revenues in the financials that business line is  million a year annual business line and it has to do mainly with medical marketing uses of scientific literature so when a pharma wants to sell a drug and the drug has positive mentions in the scientific literature they want to get that scientific literature out to clinicians so that they can be influenced in the prescribing patterns that is our legacy business it is our first business line it was pre article galaxy and a lot of those reprints and eprints are actually delivered on paper and used for marketing uses you have pharma reps visiting clinicians or going to conferences or so on that’s our historic business line mariusz skonieczny classic value investors from what i understand the eprints is the profitable portion of your business and you use that cash flow that it generates i believe it is  million per year and you use it to drive growth in article galaxy am i right peter derycz research solutions inc yeah you got part of that right the reprints and eprints is a cash generator for us it is pretty stable business it doesn’t grow by leaps and bounds but it is pretty stable business and it is kicking off close to  million in cash which we do use to reinvest in the article galaxy platform to make article galaxy more powerful every year article galaxy’s revenues now are over two times those of the reprints and eprints’ business mariusz skonieczny classic value investors when you mention eprints as a legacy business do you not expect it to be around for a long time how much longer is it going to be generating cash flow and driving the growth of the other business peter derycz research solutions inc well i think it is going to be around for a long as pharmaceutical marketing is around it is standard part of what pharma companies do with their marketing that business has been pretty steady going into this year what we do see is a lot of fluctuations a lot of seasonality or fluctuations from one quarter to another in its revenue sometimes there is a lot of pharma marketing going on and we get a lot of revenue and sometimes there is little marketing going on in which case revenues drop so it is very sort of fluctuates but it this point it pretty much stays at a steady annual  million rate mariusz skonieczny classic value investors now going back to article galaxy again obviously this is the business you are focusing a lot of energy on where the other one you don’t have to do too much to maintain it if you look five years ahead what kind of plans do you have for that business just to give investors an idea of what they could hope for in the future peter derycz research solutions inc there are over  research based organizations around the world and our mission and desires are centered around having article galaxy be deployed on the desktop of every researcher in the world and there is quite a few of them so we really want to be to scientific research what lexis nexis is to legal research or what bloomberg is to financial research if you are in the financial community you have bloomberg terminals if you are a law firm you will have lexis or westlaw and we think that if you are a research based organization you will be using article galaxy mariusz skonieczny classic value investors did you say the number was  organizations peter derycz research solutions inc yeah there are actually to be more precise there are  research based organization in the world mariusz skonieczny classic value investors within that number do you just mean corporations or do you also include academia in it because from what i understand you entered the academia world not too long ago peter derycz research solutions inc correct so that’s across all organizations that’s private enterprise it’s government research institutes as well as universities and we then launched a version of article galaxy that is geared towards the academics or what they call the university market and so we are getting a lot of customer adoption in the university market and the revenue in the sort of trailing behind i believe it is about  percent of our customer accounts is from the academic market now and about  percent of revenue but it is growing and we think that the university market is starting to discover what article galaxy can do mariusz skonieczny classic value investors but you entered the academic market not too long ago am i correct peter derycz research solutions inc correct we got specialized pricing and things like that and a few other things that we do from the technology side that we integrated into the platform to be able to more specifically address that economic market because we think it is pretty huge we want to be ready for that as it evolves into different ways of acquiring information mariusz skonieczny classic value investors was it difficult to break into that market at first peter derycz research solutions inc yes i think it is difficult because we were highly focused on the corporate market a lot of our marketing and sales was going into the corporate market so when we approached the academic market a lot of people didn’t know about us so we had to start building brand and reputation and try to get the word to spread initially universities tend to operate on smaller chain cycles than private enterprises so universities establish budgets much in advance and they change these around but processes and procedures and buying patterns tend to stay pretty stable so we have to really plugging away at it and as they discover us and find us and change their budgets and change their operating procedures they can incorporate us in their information workflows mariusz skonieczny classic value investors if you get more traction within the academic market is this out of question that your company could be looking at having revenues of  million a year am i being too optimistic peter derycz research solutions inc well we don’t put out projections like that but you can make some predictions we have about  paying organizations today as customers generating revenues for article galaxy and as i mentioned there are literally hundreds of thousands of them so if we can multiply our customer base from  to  accounts and multiply that to  to  accounts then you will see us at those numbers mariusz skonieczny classic value investors in other words the room for growth is there peter derycz research solutions inc absolutely mariusz skonieczny classic value investors can you talk a little bit about your competition peter derycz research solutions inc we compete against a lot of different systems and organizations to break them out for you there is direct competition on the article selling so if people want to buy an article there are many places to buy articles just like there are many places to buy a book right amazon is not the only game in town for books the same situation exists with articles being sold through article galaxy and we do compete that with publishers’ own websites with customers wanting to pull out the credit card and go buy an article and register on that publisher’s website they can easily do that we compete against piracy we compete against doityourselfers we can have customer hire a bunch of people and have them go and bring them all these articles anyway they can aside from that we have a platform side of article galaxy and and on that side we would be competing against some software companies but they tend to not be great or able at all to deliver the information content that people need in the academic market we compete against a system called interlibrary loans where universities are sending pieces of information to each other they are a little bit slow and cumbersome other than that it is about changing people’s habits and getting people to find a value here and start adopting mariusz skonieczny classic value investors thank you very much peter for taking the time to do this interview with me i don’t have any more questions if you have anything else you want to add please go ahead if not then thank you very much peter derycz research solutions inc we are just getting started here article galaxy is getting a lot of attention now over the years we have been focusing on article galaxy we think the technology is evolving greatly and we are improving it and we think we can get to having thousands or tens of thousands of corporations and research organizations around the world as customers mariusz skonieczny classic value investors ok perfect thank you for your time products how gold companies finance
