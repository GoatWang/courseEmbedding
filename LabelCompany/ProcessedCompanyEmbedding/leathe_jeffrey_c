technology originally invented for scanning the inside of your mouth might lead to betterfitting earbuds and hearing aids thanks to lantos which just announced a new chief executive jeffrey c leathe along with a  million second round of funding traditionally if you need an image of your ear canal a doctor pours silicon gel into your ear which expands and hardens to create a model of your inner ear the process is uncomfortable cannot safely reach the entire length of the canal and can sometimes be inaccurate not to mention that it might make you think disturbing thoughts of the star trek wrath of kahn eareel scene lantos’ product however minimizes the invasive nature of earmapping lantos’ d scanner is like putting a thin pencil in your ear according to new chief executive and chairman of the board jeffrey leathe the probe has a “sophisticated balloon” or membrane at the end that can be inflated and then safely travels all the way down the ear canal a liquid travels along the membrane and allows a camera aided by a light at the end of the probe to record thousands of data points along the canal this forms the d image without much disturbance to the patient the idea was born in the mit lab of doug hart who created d oral scanning technology later bought by m this technology also replaced a molded impression technique but for teeth now leathe has been brought on board to lead the earfocused technology down the path of testing for not one but three markets audiology hearing aids military and consumer use “we are just entering clinical trials our major clinical trial will be held with the us army” leathe told venturebeat in an interview the military has shown significant interest in this technology according to leathe particularly for hearing protection and two way communications devices leathe was limited in what he could discuss surrounding the products themselves he did mention however current impressiontaking technology doesn’t make for a comfortable fitting device thus some soldiers opt to not wear protective ear pieces so as not to hinder their performance if that practice is widespread it’s no wonder the military is reaching out for a better way to protect its soldiers other studies will be done in audiologists’ private practices and institutions for hearing aid development along with a branch in the consumer direction “we’ve been taking to a lot of folks in the consumer industry but it’s early” said leathe currently a few companies such as etymotics  will make a personal set of earbuds for your headphones but it’s pricey this is where lantos would step in with a more accurate picture of your ear and subsequent ear bud “look at dr dre that’s  for a pair of dr dre headphones” said leathe “people are willing to pay a large amount of money for better audio quality” lantos will be using its funding to move the device out of prototype stage and into production next year the device will officially be launched at the aaa conference an audiology event based in boston in mid the company is headquartered near boston in cambridge mass and was founded in  lantos has  employees strong and has raised  million total in
