  how it all started founded by dr samir damani a practicing cardiologist md revolution was born out of dr damani’s drive to transform the delivery of healthcare and chronic disease management  as a healthcare provider dr damani had a unique perspective on the impact of chronic disease every day he saw firsthand what happens when diet and exercise are neglected his patients were often at a stage when disease is the riskiest and most expensive to fix he knew they needed more support than he could provide in an office visit the system was failing them both healthcare costs continued to skyrocket the incidence of preventable conditions soared and the paradigm of “disease care” medicine showed no signs of changing frustrated dr damani began assembling a mix of investors healthcare professionals and technology experts who would together help launch an entirely new approach to care management when the vision came to life in  md revolution inc opened its doors on the scripps memorial la jolla campus in california the overarching goal was – and still is – to get people excited about and engaged in their health as the team rapidly developed the models and solutions for population health and care management dr damani realized that the company had an obligation to bring md revolution’s unique combination of traditional medicine nutrition and fitness science and digital care management technology to the masses leadership solutions blog i believed then and still believe today that our approach will become the gold standard for the future of healthcare after all the only way we can reverse the chronic disease epidemic is to make the personalized health experience accessible to everyone samir damani md pharmd facc learn more about the revolution contact us

tubes in your ordinary household refuse flea control in dogs and cats for the prevention and control of flea infestations revolution should be administered at monthly intervals throughout the flea season starting one month before fleas become active in controlled laboratory studies  of fleas were killed within  hours results of clinical field studies using revolution monthly demonstrated  control of flea infestations within  days of the first dose dogs and cats treated with revolution including those with preexisting flea allergy dermatitis showed improvement in clinical signs associated with fleas as a direct result of eliminating the fleas from the animals and their environment if the dog or cat is already infested with fleas when the first dose of revolution is administered adult fleas on the animal are killed and no viable fleas hatch from eggs after the first administration however an environmental infestation of fleas may persist for a short time after beginning treatment with revolution because of the emergence of adult fleas from pupae heartworm prevention in dogs and cats for the prevention of heartworm disease revolution must be administered on a monthly basis revolution may be administered yearround or at least within one month after the animals first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season the final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes if a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of revolution and resumption of monthly dosing will minimize the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms when replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention program the first dose of revolution must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication selamectin the active ingredient in revolution is a macrocyclic lactone compound these compounds effectively prevent the development of adult heartworms when administered to dogs and cats within one month of exposure to infective l dirofilaria immitis larvae efficacy of macrocyclic lactones decreases below  in dogs however if first administered  months after exposure to infective larvae thus in heartworm endemic regions delaying initiation of heartworm prevention using revolution beyond  months of first exposure to infective larvae eg starting puppies and kittens at  weeks of age or gaps of  months in the administration of revolution during periods of heartworm transmission increases the risk of the animal acquiring heartworms animals with unknown heartworm history that test negative for heartworms prior to the initiation of revolution may be harboring prepatent infections at the time revolution was started testing such animals  months after initiation of revolution would be necessary to confirm their negative heartworm status at the discretion of the veterinarian cats  months of age may be tested to determine the presence of existing heartworm infections before beginning treatment with revolution cats already infected with adult heartworms can be given revolution monthly to prevent further infections ear mite treatment in dogs and cats for the treatment of ear mite o cynotis infestations in dogs and cats revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent ear mite infestations in the clinical field trials ears were not cleaned and many animals still had debris in their ears after the second dose cleansing of the infested ears is recommended to remove the debris sarcoptic mange treatment in dogs for the treatment of sarcoptic mange s scabiei in dogs revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent sarcoptic mange mite infestations because of the difficulty in finding sarcoptic mange mites on skin scrapings effectiveness assessments also were based on resolution of clinical signs resolution of the pruritus associated with the mite infestations was observed in approximately  of the dogs  days after the first treatment and in approximately  of the dogs  days after the second monthly treatment tick control
