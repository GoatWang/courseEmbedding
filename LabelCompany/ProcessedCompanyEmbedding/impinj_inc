over  since july  we believe pi has a strong product portfolio and the amazon acquisition of whole foods would translate into a much higher stock price in the coming quarters than their current priceover the last year impinj inc nasdaqpi has been experiencing solid growth momentum and their management was able to improve the companys efficiency although impinj inc is still losing money as a high growth company we believe they have a strong possibility of becoming profitable if they can scale their operation which seems more likely amid latest developments since july   impinj incs stock price has gone up by  since july   impinj incs stock price has gone up from  per share and it is currently trading at  per share representing an increase of  within the last year the bullish momentum was one again accelerated last week after ecommerce giant amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn announced to acquire whole foods market inc nasdaqwfm for  billion how amazon buying whole foods can help impinj impinj incs radiofrequency identification technology is widely used in various applications including retail sectors and in the health care industry to track inventory and plan deliveries there were already rumors in the market that amazons go concept stores were using impinj incs technology with the acquisition of whole foods market several analysts including rbc capitals mitch steves predicted that the deal could help impinj incs rfid systems find a new growth area however investors should not directly link the acquisition as a certainty that amazoncom inc will start using impinj incs products we need to keep in mind that they can decide to use radiofrequency identification technology but end up picking a different companys product nonetheless the fact remains that amazoncom inc is a member of impinj inc led rain alliance which was created to study and encourage the radiofrequency identification technology hence there is a strong possibility that impinj inc might get a bump in their sales because of this acquisition by amazoncom inc impinj has been experiencing solid growth over the last year compared to only  million revenue in q  impinj incs q  revenue came out at  million which represented a  increase impinj incs management was able to translate this top line growth into a solid increase gross profit as well during the last four quarters impinj incs gross profit increased from only  million in q  to  million in q  representing a  growth it is worth noting that impinj incs management was able to increase their gross profit rate compared to their overall quarterly revenue growth rate which indicates that besides growth their management has also focused on increasing the overall efficiency of the company as well consequently impinj inc posted a  million net loss in q compared to a  million net loss in the same quarter last year meanwhile in q  they actually managed to maintain breakeven by posting a  net profit conclusion during q  earnings call chris diorio the cofounder  chief executive officer of impinj inc mentioned that  endpoint ic volumes would be between  billion and  billion units which would represent a  growth over s midpoint if you take a minute and step back from the commercial aspects of this information you would realize that impinj inc is selling one ic unit for each person in the world alive today now from a commercial perspective the good news is that on average each person got more than one gadget that can be connected and that offers huge growth potential impinj inc currently has a high price target of  per share based on the current market price of  per share this price target offers an additional  upside potential however we believe if amazoncom inc indeed decides to buy their radiofrequency identification technology products from impinj inc this secular growth story would likely to continue in the near future and their stock price would go much higher in the coming quarters moreover if the whole foods market acquisition does not play well for impinj inc they still got a killer product portfolio to gradually improve their sales which would safeguard future growth momentum disclosure

chips and indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers mexico has certified the impinj speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in mexico in july  in  impinj began working with intel to develop rfid chips that would allow for “processor secured storage” impinj created two new chips for the project monza xk dura and monza xk dura which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices the chips will be used in intels microsoft windows based processors for tablet computers which will be released in the second half of  rfid productsedit monza rfid tag chipsedit introduced in april  monza tag chips were the first uhf gen  rfid tag chips upon their introduction it was announced that impinj would be selling  million monza tag chips that year these  million chips were sold to nine different companies including competitors alien technology and texas instruments in  impinj introduced its monza  tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options in april  impinj released their new monza  chips which are designed to speed itemlevel encoding with fewer errors the monza  can boost encoding speeds by up to  percent compared with other rfid technology on the market announced in april  impinjs monza x tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration when embedded in an electronic device such as a laptop pc the device processor or an rfid reader can write to or read data from that device through a monza x chip even when the device is powered off impinj developed the monza x chips through a partnership with intel that began in  impinj created the monza xk and monza xk dura chips with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers intel will be using the monza x chips in

revolution rfid reader and speedway xportal rfid reader the speedway rfid reader was first introduced in  as the first rfid reader sold by impinj designed to meet the rfid gen  standards speedway was one of impinjs grandprix products alongside monza the speedway revolution rfid reader was introduced in  the speedway revolution is  smaller than the original speedway rfid reader measuring  x  x  inches the speedway revolution introduced autopilot technology which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts introduced in  the speedway xportal is a rfid fixed reader that combined the speedway revolution with duallinear phased array technology with a smaller design than previous reader portals whereas previous portal readers weighed about  lbs the speedway xportal weighs  lbs and measures  x  x  inches indy rfid reader chipsedit in  impinj acquired the intel rfid division including an inteldeveloped rfid reader chip which impinj renamed indy r by combining many electrical components on one microchip rfid reader chips can minimize size and costs of rfid readers as of   to  manufacturers had developed readers using the r chip in  impinj unveiled the indy r reader chip with increased performance designed for use in highend readers for more challenging applications in  impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the indy r reader chip a lower cost chip for applications that dont require high performance stp source tagging platformedit in  impinj announced its stp source tagging platform a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of rfid tags the platform consists of two systems bulk encoding for tags already attached to items or inline encoding before tags are applied to products the stp platform is capable of encoding  tags per minute in the bulk system and up to  tags per minute using the inline system in  impinj announced a version  release of the stp platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to  tags per minute store performance simulatoredit impinjs store performance simulator sps released in june  is a “webbased analysis tool” designed to show retailers how rfid can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability a retailer can use spss  inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “whatif” scenarios rather than running unfeasible realworld tests see alsoedit avery dennison intermec philips sato global solutions st microelectronics symbol technologies tyco international upm raflatac
