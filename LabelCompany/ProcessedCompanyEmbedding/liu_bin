talks  introduction this work is in the area of sentiment analysis and opinion mining from social media eg reviews forum discussions and blogs in our kdd paper we proposed the featurebased opinion mining model which is now also called aspectbased opinion mining as the term feature here can confuse with the term feature used in machine learning the output of such opinion mining is a featurebased opinion summary or aspectbased opinion summary the commonly known sentiment classification is a subtask our current work is in two main areas which reflect two kinds of opinions or evaluations mining regular or direct opinions ex  this camera is great  after taking the drug i got stomach pain mining comparative opinions ex coke tastes better than pepsi since 6 we have also worked on fake review and opinion spam detection fake reviews are also called bogus reviews or fraudulent reviews see the papers www wsdm cikma cikmb www  sentiment analysis or mining of regular opinions in this research we aim to mine and to summarize online opinions in reviews tweets blogs forum discussions etc specifically we mine features or aspects of entities eg products or topics on which people have expressed their opinions and determine whether the opinions are positive or negative for opinion summarization we advocate the quantitative aspect and the target of opinions because  of the people say something is bad is not the same as  say it is bad abstraction of the problem featurebased opinion mining and summarization aspectbased opinion mining and summarization of multiple reviews kdd and www formal definitions can be found in my book sentiment analysis and opinion mining they are based on several of our papers in  and  the abstraction provides a model of online opinions describes what should be extracted from opinion sources eg reviews forums and blogs and how the results may be organized and presented to the user the main mining tasks are mining entities and their features or aspects that have been commented on or evaluated by people determining whether the commentopinion on each entity feature or aspect is positive negative or neutral aspectbased sentiment classification and summarizing the results  sentiment analysis of comparative opinions a comparative sentence usually expresses an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some shared features or aspects for example the comparative sentence canons optics are better than those of sony and nikon expresses the comparative relation better  live please help us narrow down your search all states
