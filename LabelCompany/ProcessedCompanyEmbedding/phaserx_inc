directors founders and scientific advisors contact our mission phaserx is dedicated to transforming families’ lives by creating better treatments for children with inherited diseases actually correcting the problems at the source by replacing missing or damaged enzymes to allow the body’s natural processes to work we are developing a portfolio of mrna products for inherited liver diseases and in  we expect to achieve clinical proof of concept in the first set of therapies to treat children born with lifethreatening inherited liver diseases phaserx’s technology replaces missing or defective enzymes inside the liver cells correcting the underlying cause of inherited liver diseases this is achieved by intracellular enzyme replacement therapy iert which targets synthesis of delivered mrna specifically to liver cells our current product portfolio focuses on treating urea cycle disorders ucds which can result in cumulative and irreversible brain damage due to the liver’s inability to process ammonia from the blood we believe our iert technology can be applied to a significant number of other inherited liver diseases market opportunity we are dedicated to transforming patients’ and families’ lives we believe the intracellular enzyme replacement therapy iert market opportunity is completely untapped and validated by the current  billion worldwide conventional enzyme replacement therapy ert market by replacing defective enzymes operating within cells iert is expected to enable the treatment of diseases which cannot be treated with conventional ert such as urea cycle disorders in addition to urea cycle disorders we expect our iert therapeutic platform to be applicable to a significant number of other inherited liver diseases that cannot be treated with conventional ert the fda orphan drug program provides economic incentives to encourage companies to develop treatments for rare diseases this program has substantially increased industry research for orphan diseases since inception and we expect to benefit from economic incentives available from this program our technical advantages combined with the fda incentives create an opportunity for positive social impact as well as commercial success health impact urea cycle disorders are typically diagnosed between birth and the age of twelve and can lead to devastating consequences including cumulative and irreversible brain damage coma and death ucd patients live with a constant risk of becoming very sick due to increased levels of ammonia in the blood which cause brain damage and potentially fatal ammonia toxicity the only cure for ucds is a liver transplant currently available drug treatments do not correct the disease and do not eliminate the risk of lifethreatening crises without correction even on the best available treatment a strict diet dietary supplements and ammonia scavengers patients continue to be at risk for lifethreatening crises caused by high blood ammonia our iert approach is designed to replace the missing urea cycle enzyme return function to the urea cycle and correct the damaging and potentially fatal buildup of ammonia in the blood in ucd patients ultimately we believe our therapies have the potential to eliminate the need for liver transplants in the most severely affected otcd patients innovative delivery a key challenge with mrna therapeutics is effective delivery our hybrid mrna technologytm platform is specifically designed to overcome barriers to administration of mrna and represents a sophisticated solution for delivering mrna therapeutics our technology platform combines a lipid nanoparticle with a proprietary polymer technology the lipid nanoparticlethat encapsulates and protects the fragile mrna in the blood and delivers it to liver cells the polymer facilitates delivery of mrnas into cells’ cytoplasm intracellular delivery preclinical data suggest that our hybrid mrna technologytm enables high levels of synthesis of the desired protein with good tolerability and without loss of effectiveness with repeat dosing progress led by a team with extensive expertise in nucleic acid delivery technology we have already generated positive preclinical data for two pipeline compounds and are progressing rapidly toward clinical trials treatment with our lead product prxotc has shown normalization of blood ammonia levels and percent survival in otcdeficient hyperammonemic mice the standard model for this disease as well as a promising safety profile similarly prxasl therapy showed statistically significant reduction in ammonia levels following two weeks of mrna treatment in mice deficient in the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase asl based on our preclinical data the company expects to achieve lowering of blood ammonia in our phase a and b clinical proofofconcept studies for prxotc in  lowering of blood ammonia is believed to be an approvable endpoint for the ucds since it was the basis for the fda’s approval of current treatments to treat the ucds in  intellectual property we have a strong intellectual property portfolio covering the world’s major pharmaceutical markets with over  patents issued and many patent applications pending which are either exclusively licensed from the university of washington or invented by our own scientists this patent portfolio covers the polymer technology hybrid mrna technologytm and structures of mrna phaserx therapy and product pipeline select page pipeline   phaserx has developed a therapeutics platform applicable to a host of diseases our initial focus is on three urea cycle disorders ucds as first targets as we believe we can achieve life changing impacts within a reasonable timeframe prxotc for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency otcd prxasl for argininosuccinatelyase deficiency asld argininosuccinatesynthetase  ass deficiency phaserx believes its approach helps mitigate the costs and risks associated with biotech drug development which are often attributable to a poor understanding of the disease biology and the mechanism of action of the drug candidate as well as the need for large clinical trials and uncertainty about approvable endpoints we believe our costs and risks will be lower because the biology of our disease programs is well understood our target diseases are caused by a bad gene inherited from parents that results in a defective or missing enzyme inside the liver cell the mechanism of action of our therapeutics is clear we are simply replacing the missing enzyme using our intracellular enzyme replacement therapy approach clinical proof of concept can be obtained in relatively few patients we believe we can obtain clinical proofs of concept in very few  patients and ultimately achieve product registration based on  patients as opposed to hundreds or even thousands of patients needed to obtain clinical proof of concept and registration in other diseases such as cancer diabetes etc there is an approvable endpoint in lead programs we believe lowering of blood ammonia is an approvable endpoint for our lead urea cycle disease ucd programs since an ammonia scavenger was approved by fda in  for the treatment of the ucds on the basis of lowering blood ammonia also ammonia can be quickly and readily measured by a blood assay future indications include organic acidemias glycogen storage diseases porphyria hyperoxalurea phenylketonuria tyrosinemia wilson’s disease   phaserx founders and scientific advisors select page founders  scientific advisors

dose response study in nonhuman primates the administration of mrna delivered using the companys proprietary hybrid mrna technologytm platform in a large animal model was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels tested – an important step prior to advancing its lead mrna drug candidate towards clinical development the company has previously shown therapeutic effect in its lead program prxotc in the preclinical model of ornithine transarbamylase deficiency otcd including both lowering of blood ammonia and rescue of  of treated mice    in the nonhuman primate study human erythropoietin hepo mrna dosed at   and  mgkg delivered with the hybrid mrna technologytm platform demonstrated dosedependent increases in levels of hepo protein with a very favorable safety profile elevations of hepo protein levels at three orders of magnitude above normal physiological levels were achieved in addition a commensurate increase was also seen in reticulocyte count a cell type expressed in response to hepo which was robust and seen in all dose groups the formulation was extremely well tolerated in nonhuman primates with no statistically significant doserelated changes in liver enzymes or cytokines including il tnfa ifng il or ip we have now demonstrated that our mrna delivery system is safe in a large animal study said robert w overell phd president and chief executive officer these data
