public sources such as stock exchange filings annual reports company presentations third party research and press releases in judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source the greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a likeforlike comparison in project costs insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature no attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money validation in the case of stateowned projects validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium epc contractor a relevant state agency or advisors to either party currency projects costs are measured in us
