board of directors investors management team company founders lti’s unique approach to discovering new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases is based on research performed in the lab of dr dimitri krainc one of the companys founders at massachusetts general hospital mgh a founding member of partners healthcare and an affiliate of harvard medical school the work completed at mgh by dr krainc and dr joseph mazzulli lti’s scientific cofounder and a former postdoctoral fellow in the lab builds on the association between gaucher disease a rare lysosomal storage disorder lsd caused by mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase gcase and a predisposition to parkinson’s disease they demonstrated that increasing gcase activity in human neurons of gaucher disease and parkinsons disease patients can normalize lysosomal function and improve neuronal survival this research continues at northwestern university where dr krainc is now ward professor and chairman of the department of neurology and dr mazzulli is an assistant professor of neurology  about us​​ delivering cures for neurodegenerative diseases  copyright   lysosomal therapeutics inc view on mobileour science genetics linkage between rare and common diseasethe connection between genetic mutations in the gcase enzyme and parkinsons disease goes beyond gauchers disease the risk of developing parkinsons disease pd in the broader population has been firmly linked to gcase mutations sidransky and lopez  at the biochemical level reduced gcase activity in the brain is correlated with synuclein accumulation and increased pd risk sidransky and lopez  for example the risk of pd in gaucher patients who have  normal gcase activity is fold higher compared to the general population while the risk of pd in carriers of the gcase mutations who have  normal gcase activity is  fold increased it follows that increasing gcase activity in both gaucher patients and mutantgcase carriers could significantly decrease pd risk and possibly the rate of disease progression recently data have emerged suggesting that gcase levels are also low in idiopathic pd patients with two normal gcase alleles gegg et al  building on these findings researchers at the national human genome research institute have developed models of macrophages the cells that use gcase to break down lipids of gaucher disease that will help facilitate future drug development efforts aflaki et al  ltis lead program is focused on developing gcase agonists to treat pd for both the gaucher and common pd community delivering cures for neurodegenerative diseases  therapeutic development in neurodegenerative diseaselti is leveraging its expertise in lysosomal biology to develop novel small molecules to be used in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases our lead program the gcase agonist has its foundation in a small molecule gcase activator discovered by the national institute of health lti has the exclusive license to this intellectual property this lead will be optimized to identify a clinical candidate we are currently improving upon the pharmacological parameters of this molecule and advancing toward lead identification with the help of a grant from the michael j fox foundation lti is also studying gcase as a biomarker to be used for identifying parkinsons disease patients likely to respond to our

lysosome functions as a processing center in human cells breaking down proteins into their building blocks when errors occur in the enzymes used in this processing center buildup of unwanted proteins occur resulting in cellular damage a set of genetic diseases called lysosomal storage disorders are the result of genetic mutations in different lysosomal enzymes gaucher disease a lysosomal storage disorder is the result of homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gcase gene also known as gba people diagnosed with gaucher disease have a buildup of a lipid gloucosylceramide in their cells causing serious health issues including a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinsons many other lysosomal storage disorders carry this similar profile genetic mutations lead to

lysosomal therapeutics inc lti for its potential firstinclass breakthrough compounds  marks allergans entry into parkinsons disease an important adjacency to companys innovative cns development pipeline   lead compound lti represents a compelling opportunity for treatment of parkinsons disease in a subpopulation with specific genetic mutations   option to acquire lti following completion of phase b clinical trial  dublin and cambridge mass jan   prnewswire  allergan plc nyse agn a leading global pharmaceutical company and lysosomal therapeutics lti today announced that allergan has purchased an exclusive option right to acquire lti  lti is focused on innovative smallmolecule research and development in the field of neurodegeneration yielding new treatment options for patients with severe neurological diseases lti ltis lead program aims to stimulate the activity of glucocerebrosidase gcase in the brain in several lysosomal storage diseases the activity of gcase is reduced due to genetic mutations in the gba gene importantly approximately  to  percent of patients with parkinsons disease pd have mutations of the gba genei and it is well documented that these patients have a more rapid progression of parkinsons disease thus it is hoped that activation of gcase by lti will impact the progression of pd in these patients under the option agreement allergan purchased an option right directly from lti shareholders to acquire lti following completion of a phase b trial for lti  in addition allergan will provide a separate upfront research and development payment  allergan and lti will establish a joint development committee to oversee the development activities for lti additional terms were not disclosed parkinsons disease is an area of strategic alignment for allergan and represents an attractive adjacency to allergans other cns businesses with emphasis on neurodegeneration and movement disorders allergans open science model enables the company to enter areas of innovation with leading partners while leveraging their expertise through creative partnerships parkinsons disease is an area of medicine where significant unmet need exists particularly in the development and potential breakthrough of diseasemodifying treatments for the more than  million people suffering with parkinsons today said david nicholson chief research  development officer allergan the pioneering work of the lti team in developing its gcase program harnesses the link between gcase activity and disease progression in patients with a gba mutation who suffer from parkinsons disease the intention is to provide therapeutic benefit for the affected patients by modulating gcase activity we look forward to working with the lti team to further their work in this area and the potential for positive phase  results lti is paving a new path in the characterization of parkinsons disease including the understanding of a patients glycosphingolipid profile and its relevance to therapeutic response said kees been ceo of lysosomal therapeutics  we are pleased to work with allergan to support the acceleration of ltis leading gcase activators to reach as many parkinsons patients as soon as possible  the allergan team matched its commitment to our leading science with a compelling approach to collaboration – we are thrilled to provide our new partner with development candidates for severe neurodegenerative diseases  we look forward to reaching the milestones that will deliver significant value to both companies and most of all to developing much needed therapeutics for patients with pd dr kenneth marek president and senior scientist at the institute for neurodegenerative disorders of the michael j fox parkinson progression marker initiative clinical professor of neurology at yale university and a member of ltis scientific advisory board added the key unmet need for parkinsons disease patients and families is to slow disease progression lti has taken a novel personal medicine approach to parkinsons disease targeting rapidlyprogressing patients who carry a mutant gba gene  the lti drug candidate which is designed to reverse the loss of enzyme activity in patients with the genetic mutation has a chance to be the first drug in its class  covington  burling llp served as allergans legal counsel  goodwin procter llp and faber daeufer  itrato
