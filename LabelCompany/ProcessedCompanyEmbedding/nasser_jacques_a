the editor and we may publish it in print as ford motor co struggles financially the no  guessing game in detroit is how long can ceo jacques nasser keep his job rumors swirl daily that nasser will be gone by year endthe pressure increased last week when the board of directors cut the stock dividend in half but that was just one more turn of the screw the company has lost  points of market share this year quality slipped below general motors and ford posted a  billion pretax charge to cover the cost of the firestone tire recalla company spokesman declined to comment on speculation about nassers futurewhether or not nasser holds on the question has turned a spotlight on his yearold administration revealing wrong turns misjudgments and mistakesnasser lost his footing on six fundamental issues ford lost its focus as an automaker under nasser ford did not define itself as an automaker instead ford became a consumer company providing automotive goods and servicesthe result ford began struggling in its core business of engineering manufacturing and selling cars and trucks product quality slipped below gm and daimlerchrysler product launches were botchedthe fix fords turnaround specialist nick scheele arrived from europe aug  this month he signaled a change in course we are going back to the basics scheele the new head of the ford brand in north america said let me repeat that first and foremost we are going back to the basics the company with the best cars and trucks wins nasser fell under the spell of the internet in the late s the internet bubble rose on the economic landscape enticing companies with the lure of profits from ebusinesses trading at huge priceearnings multiples nasser envisioned taking public various units of a newly created ford ecommerce group capitalizing on the phenomenal market value of internet stocks and vaulting ford into the internet agethe result the strategy collapsed with the internet economy the fallout spilled over to fords relations with a core constituency its retailers dealers today still smart from nassers experiments in eretailing viewing attempts to sell and service vehicles on the internet as a threat to the franchised dealer networkthe fix last week fords topranking internet executive brian kelley was moved to an oldeconomy job president of lincoln mercury ford division executives are meeting in orlando fla wednesday oct  through friday oct in an attempt to repair dealer relations nasser attempted to go on his own too much nasser tried to oversee personally too many aspects of running a global corporationthe result as many as  executives reported directly to the ford ceo bent on singlehandedly wielding power at the top nasser failed to create a strong operating executive to back up the ceo nassers micromanaging slowed decisionmaking and created a company in organizational limbo awaiting directionthe fix in july the ford board of directors moved to circumscribe nassers role and cultivate a new group of decisionmakers by the end of this year only  executives will report to nasser lines of authority were drawn more clearly ford granted scheele autonomous power to rebuild the ford brand in north america the company also vested more power in manufacturing boss jim padilla to tackle the core problem of shoddy vehicle quality nasser neglected william clay ford jr nasser failed to develop a sensible working relationship with bill ford when the ford scion became nonexecutive chairman in january the result the company had an uneasy balance of leadership nassers handson style failed to accommodate bill fords growing influencethe fix in july the ford board created an office of the chairman and ceo increasing the authority and decisionmaking voice of bill ford bill ford also has more facetoface dealings with company executives bill ford and nasser meet regularly relying on a formal agenda nasser underestimated bridgestonefirestone inc ceo john lampe nasser compounded the firestone tire recall by underestimating lampe who refused to back down when ford fingered  million additional firestone tires as potentially faultythe result nasser and lampe engaged in corporate mudslinging and fingerpointing before the press congress and the public the spectacle of firestone blaming the ford explorer and ford blaming the tire maker for road deaths damaged the reputations of both companies meanwhile the enormous amount of time that nasser spent on the crisis left other important tasks undonethe fix the debate is not over bridgestonefirestone is standing behind its tough tactics despite the companys decision to recall more tires labeled defective by the federal government ford has yet to be exonerated in the court of public opinion nasser spent too much time on premier automotive group as part of a lofty vision nasser acquired volvo and land rover hoping to leverage the bigname brands into a global luxury powerhouse under the premier automotive group umbrellathe result core brands such as ford in north america stood in line for management time talent and money nassers strategy made ford more vulnerable in north america the companys chief source of profitsthe fix the company empowered scheele to rebuild the ford brand but overhauling product quality enriching product offerings and reestablishing rapport with dealers will take time contact

the automobile maker founded by henry ford and one of the bestknown companies in the world nasser planned to transform ford by changing its focus from automotive products to consumer goods while emphasizing global competitiveness he was unable to reverse fords steady loss of market share in its core business and could not save the company from a product safety scandal nassers harsh human resources policies antagonized ford workers and their family members and contributed to his dismissal outsider born in lebanon nasser moved with his family to melbourne australia at the age of four his olive skin marked him as an outsider in an australia unfriendly to immigrants the experience of prejudice reinforced nassers ambition to succeed while imbuing him with a resistance to being bound by tradition it would also later make him sensitive to the problems of women and minorities despite the difficulties in australia nasser began to thrive as an entrepreneur he spent his teenage years starting businesses including a bicyclemaking operation and a discotheque his first professional experience came as a student intern at ford of australia after being graduated from the royal melbourne institute of technology with a degree in business nasser joined ford as a financial analyst on the move gregarious energetic and persistent nasser moved rapidly through the ranks of ford he held positions in australia thailand the philippines venezuela mexico argentina brazil and europe by displaying wizardry with cost cutting this global experience and leadership strength made nasser an appealing choice for a company looking to expand its reach around the world to almost universal acclaim nasser in  was named president and chief executive officer of ford motor company robert a lutz vice chairman of rival chrysler categorized nasser as a brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker before adding theyd be crazy not to give him the top job zesiger june   at the time ford had  employees in two hundred countries sales and revenues of  billion record earnings of  billion and a stock price of  per share passion for change despite its success ford had lost a considerable amount of market share by the s nasser immediately began to streamline the company in an effort to create a giant that responded quickly to consumers nasser closed moneylosing plants discontinued models that did not generate adequate profits sold unprofitable operations and weeded out executives he also instituted a human resources policy mandating that  percent of workers receive a c grade that could lead to termination nasser argued that new people new philosophies and new technologies were required to assure fords success in the new economy ford employees unflatteringly gave nasser the nickname jac the knife contrary to later complaints that he spent little time on the core car business nasser aimed to reinvigorate fords passenger car market but ford made most of its profits from trucks and nasser struggled to hold market share in the face of stiff japanese competition during his reign nasser oversaw the growth and acquisition of jaguar aston martin volvo land rover and hertz he added strength to fords light truck and sport utility vehicles and oversaw successes with the introduction of the ford ka and the ford focus as well as the sporty twoseater

program that provided home computers and internet access to employees workers gained the power in a very hierarchical company to make decisions both small and large nasser also launched his own affirmative action program ensuring that  percent of new employees came from minority groups product recall and personnel disasters nassers greatest challenge came in  when fords flagship fourwheeldrive sport utility vehicle the explorer was involved in numerous rollover accidents two hundred deaths were ultimately linked to the firestone wilderness at tires that were standard issue on the vehicle firestone recalled  million tires and ford committed itself to replace millions more nasser defended the integrity of ford even appearing in television commercials to protect the longterm corporate reputation of the company and its employees in the short term the company reported its first consecutive quarterly losses in nearly a decade while the explorer debacle soured fords fortunes and contributed to nassers removal in october  plummeting employee morale was the factor that ensured his dismissal the ford family controlled  percent of the company stock and had a paternal attitude toward employees the family had serious disagreements with nasser over his draconian personnel evaluation methods and the resulting employee lawsuits when he replaced nasser as ceo william ford jr

fortunecom whats behind fords fall  oct   fortunecom crunch time for jac  june   fortunecom idealist on board  apr     new york cnnmoney  ford motor co said tuesday that jacques nasser will be replaced as chief executive officer by william clay ford jr as the nations no  automaker struggles to stem losses in addition nick scheele the group vice president for north america will become the new chief operating officer of ford motor while jim padilla  group vice president for manufacturing and quality will take over scheeles job as head of the north america unit and longtime ford board member carl reichardt the retired ceo and chairman of wells fargo  co wfc research estimates will take the title of vice chairman of the board and take an active role overseeing financial operations including ford credit   jacques nasserford ceo is out of a job the moves come as ford has been cutting management positions and other jobs in recent months during a review of company operations as it struggles to return to profitability ford f up  to  research estimates stock was little changed in midday trading after the longanticipated announcement scheele who was brought to north america this summer after making improvements in fords european operations and luxury brands was already conducting a review of the businesses looking for cost savings scheele said tuesday that review was about halfway done although he said that the prechristmas deadline for a final costcutting plan could be pushed back to early january he and ford told a tuesday news conference that all parts of the company are under scrutiny we wont hesitate to pull the trigger if something isnt fitting in well said ford i think we have lost the focus in a couple of areas   william c ford talks about his new role as ceo of ford motor co real  k k windowsmedia k k   ford  is the greatgrandson of company founder henry ford and nephew of the late former chairman and ceo henry ford ii he also is greatgrandson of harvey firestone founder of the tire company that has clashed with ford motor co in the last year over which company is to blame for fatal rollover accidents involving the popular ford explorer sportutility vehicles and firestone tires a princeton graduate with a master of science degree in management from mit the scion joined the company in  as a product planning analyst and was elected chairman of the board in september  he admits he has a different kind of reputation than the typical ceo as he said his strong proenvironmental views have given him a treehugger label he insisted tuesday his views on the environment are not at odds with companys core objectives and will be integrated into ford products through use of improved technology he also has a relatively proemployee even prounion reputation and he said improving relationships with the united autoworkers union as well as other employees and constituency groups would be a key to his job going forward you cant rebuild the business if you dont have strong partnerships ford said dealers uaw white collar employees suppliers wall street  we have a lot of relationships that are important to us a lot of those are broken or not healthy ford becomes the third descendent of founder henry ford to hold the top executive job but the first since his uncle henry ford ii stepped down as ceo in  ford also said that while his name and his familys control of the companys voting stock was a factor in his selection he didnt think it was the deciding factor   william clay ford greatgrandson of ford motor co founder henry ford is the new ceo of the worlds no  automaker i would hope the board of directors takes their job more seriously than putting in the guy with the right last name he said at the press conference he insisted that despite reports of problems between him and nasser the two have a good relationship and had a cordial conversation monday when discussing the change while there has been speculation about ford assuming the ceo for some time he said it was fairly recently that he and others on the board decided it was time to make the change until very recently nasser and i felt the model we had in place was going to work he said the recent problems at the company had raised the level of speculation about a change to such a level that a change became necessary he said to say we were distracted was an understatement he said it was reaching a paralysis point for a lot of our management ford also is a black belt in the martial art of tae kwon do and the vice chairman of the detroit lions football team which his family also controls youd think the lions won a game or something he joked when he was greeted by applause before his remarks to employees nasser  joined ford of australia in  as a financial analyst known as jack his costcutting efforts earned him the nickname jack the knife some analysts said that nassers departure was a good thing for the company nassers been the primary architect of a failed transformation of ford from its core automotive heritage to some expansive consumercentric organization which we think employees dealers suppliers and investors have found to varying degrees to be somewhat incomprehensible said scott hill auto analyst with sanford bernstein told cnnfns market call tuesday nasser was the companys point man in the dispute with tiremaker bridgestonefirestone inc over which company was responsible for the safety problems and hundreds of deaths linked to ford explorers equipped with firestone tires ford motor eventually decided to replace firestone wilderness at tires on its vehicles at its own expense in addition to the replacement of firestone tires which cost ford about  billion after taxes the company has been hit in recent months with declining market share and narrowing of its competitive advantage over other usbased automakers in measures of productivity amid a series of recalls and problems with the launches of new vehicles click here for a look at auto stocks on monday the company announced it was following general motors corp gm research estimates and daimlerchryler ag dcx research estimates in extending popular but expensive zerointerest financing for many of its new cars the company has pointed to the cost of those incentives as part of the reason for its losses in the third quarter and warned it would have trouble making money in the fourth quarter as well ford executives confirmed that warning tuesday without giving more specific financial guidance in his comments to employees ford emphasized the continuation of much of fords other top management in his announcement we have a strong experienced management team in place he said ford motor company is not and never has been about

from over nov st   detroit add this article to your reading list by clicking this button tweet since the days of the first henry ford outside managers have always had a precarious grip on power at the ford motor company in which the ford family holds  of the voting shares when henry ford ii known to friends as hank the deuce fired his highprofile president lee iacocca a quarter of a century ago he offered a mere five words in explanation “i just dont like you” on october th the knife was out again at the worlds secondbiggest car maker this time plunging into the back of jacques nasser the companys chief executive mr nassers place at fords helm is being taken by william clay ford jr greatgrandson of the founder and parttime chairman for the past three years the relationship between mr nasser and mr ford was never easy one row a couple of years ago grew so heated that a frightened secretary sitting outside mr nassers office summoned security the rapport did not improve when several months ago mr ford became more closely involved in the running of the company after a powersharing “office of the chairman and chief executive” was formed this week mr ford admitted that he had been plotting the removal of mr nasser for about a month the company he said had become paralysed by the “cacophony” of speculation inside and out that the pair were not getting on amid worsening performance as ford racked up losses of  billion in the past six months after a long run of profits the stockmarket welcomed the changes not because investors have developed a liking for nepotism but because the company at last appears to be facing up to its problems—and because mr ford will be surrounded by some able lieutenants these include carl reichardt a former boss of the wells fargo bank and already a nonexecutive director at ford who becomes vicechairman and finance supremo and sir nick scheele head of fords north american operations who becomes chief operating officer in the reshuffle in effect sir nick will run the company alongside mr ford in this sectionjacques knifed soap opera into the crucible so much for dynamic a strange tale no frills plenty of promise wheres the beef reprintsrelated itemsford and firestone nasserrsquos nightmarejun th the shredding of jac nassersep th the revolution at fordaug th  although mr nasser had built a reputation as a ruthless costcutter his tenure as chief executive was marked by mistakes and mishaps modelling himself on general electrics jack welch he set out to transform a hidebound car company unlike mr welch however he failed to combine charisma with the charm that can make employees like even the toughest of leaders he dared to try to overtake general motors gm as the worlds biggest car maker largely by developing carrelated service businesses instead fords sales slipped as its products lost allure in both america and europe mr nassers bold foray into ecommerce led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses under mr nasser the quality of fords vehicles long the best in detroit deteriorated so did productivity and profits ford cars now cost about  more to make than they did five years ago but prices have meanwhile fallen in real terms mr nassers bold foray into ecommerce led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses his move into car distribution buying some big dealers merely alienated the others inside the company his performancereview system which threatened laggard managers with dismissal backfired and undermined morale like the dealer purchases this policy had to be reversed all might have been forgiven or tolerated a little longer were it not for the firestone fiasco in august  and again in may  ford was forced to recall millions of firestone tyres it blamed the tyre manufacturer for a series of accidents that have now claimed more than  lives firestone insisted that the problem lay with design defects in fords explorer sportutility vehicle suv hauled before congress and pilloried in the press ford faced a year of excoriation the campaign greatly damaged the firms reputation as being customerfriendly heir transplant is mr ford the right person to get the company back on the road the first family member at the wheel since  he insisted this week unconvincingly that his newly expanded role was not just the result of “having the right last name” the highest position he held before using family clout to get on the board was running the airconditioning division but those who question his credentials do so at their peril the tenure of a former ford chairman donald peterson came to an abrupt end in  when he dared question the young mr fords desire to take a board seat going from chairman “i manage the board jacques manages the company” he used to say to chief executive will test the mettle of the affable heir he has benefited from a carefully crafted image as a family man and avowed environmentalist unlike mr nasser he is popular in ford he got a standing ovation from staff after his appointment this week he was highly visible at the scene of a power plant explosion that killed several ford employees two years ago but stayed clear of the firestone flap leaving mr nasser to take the heat however his criticism of the companys most profitable product its gasguzzling suvs vexed investors in his new role mr ford promises to use technology to benefit both shareholders and the environment virtually everything mr nasser put in place is under scrutiny his first challenge is to stop fords losses which in his words requires the company to go “back to basics” he was anything but kind this week about mr nassers legacy the abrasive australian had he said “dropped the ball” and “lost focus” virtually everything mr nasser put in place is under scrutiny in a review that has been under way for some months led by sir nick who made his reputation turning round jaguar after ford bought it in  jaguar also lost its boss this week jonathan browning who helped steer the division to record sales resigned apparently unhappy that it was being lumped with other british subsidiaries under an “operating committee” until three months ago sir nick was overseeing the turnaround at ford europe before being called to detroit to run the north american operations and carry out a review of what was going wrong in the company he also took over much of mr nassers work sir nick says he has been looking at much more than just capacity cuts he points out that ford became complacent in the lighttruck market minivans suvs and so on where its dominance came to be challenged by superior new products from competitors such as toyota this hit ford hard because light trucks are where it makes most of its profits in north america so developing new products in this area is a priority another big challenge will be rebuilding the companys relationships with customers dealers suppliers and employees “he was the right man in the right place at the wrong time” is mr nasser really to blame for all that has gone wrong “he was the right man in the right place at the wrong time” argues an admirer but the reality now facing ford is anything but the rosy picture of industry domination that mr nasser painted the company will struggle to rebuild its market share and profits in the face of a withering assault from japanese european and south korean car makers sir nick says he will not disclose targets for market share—a sure sign that times are tough worse still for ford gm is on its way to posting its first annual marketshare gain in  years forced to match the market leaders interestfree customer finance scheme fords losses are mounting to make matters worse its debt was recently downgraded by the main creditrating agencies the extra borrowing costs put ford in a “very difficult period” according to mr reichardt with signs that the american economy—and car sales—will shrink in  mr ford and his new team will struggle to find early remedies when a car company slows down as much as ford has it takes a long time and lots of punchy new products to regain momentum this article appeared in the business section of the print edition tweet

melbourne nasser is the son of businessman abdo nasser career at ford xpxthis section is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states the wikipedia editors particular feelings about a topic rather than the opinions of experts please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style april  nasser joined ford motor company in  as a financial analyst in its australian unit he then joined fords international automotive operations in various management roles in  he became vice president of finance and administration for autolatina a joint venture between ford and volkswagen in brazil and argentina he was promoted to the chairman of the board of ford europe to vice president of ford motor company in  group vice president of product development in  in  he headed ford automotive operations nicknamed jacques the knife nasser was known for his sharp costcutting efforts with fords component supplier base on  january  he became president and ceo as well as a member of the board of directors of ford motor company in dearborn michigan usa nasser became ceo when ford was the worlds most profitable automaker with profits of  billion on sales of  billion so he was given free rein to experiment nasser proclaimed that he would transform ford from a boring old car maker whose shares achieve a priceearnings ratio of only ten into a consumerproducts and services company commanding a multiple of more like thirty nasser tried to model himself after general electrics jack welch in remaking ford but he lacked charisma under nassers watch ford acquired volvo cars and land rover and placed them under the newly premier automotive group in order to expand its market share in the luxury segment nasser also aimed to overtake general motors by developing carrelated services but hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted on ecommerce car distribution junkyards and autorepair shops meanwhile the productivity of plants and quality of ford vehicles slipped according to an analyst nassers been the primary architect of a failed transformation of ford from its core automotive heritage to some expansive consumercentric organization which we think employees dealers suppliers and investors have found to varying degrees to be somewhat incomprehensible his later tenure as ceo was tainted by the firestone and ford tire controversy in september  after initially trying to avoid appearing nasser fronted a us congressional subcommittee over the recall of firestone tires fitted to fords sports utility vehicles the tires were estimated to have caused between  and  deaths through disintegration and ford is suspected to have known about problems well before the recall was issued firestone blamed the problems on the ford explorer suv though ford denied the accusation the scandal was estimated to have cost ford around a billion with share prices and quarterly results also falling sharply shortly before nasser left the company jacques nasser was also the architect of the very controversial performance management process evaluation system which ranked employee performance the evaluation system mandated that  of senior managers be given the lowest of three grades each year those who didnt improve after  years could be demoted or fired the controversy began when nasser informed shareholders on may   that they could “expect to see accelerated change” in the “diversity of our employees” that change was implemented very quickly nasser stated in a videotaped address to top executives that he did not like the sea of white faces in the audience and that the ford motor company must ensure that in the future the company reflects the broad spectrum of ford’s customers numerous classaction lawsuits were filed against ford accusing them of using the system to weed out employees on biases of skin color age and gender – not because of job performance one of the suits accused ford of systematically forcing out white males to satisfy minority quotas nasser vigorously defended the ranking system stating that it inspired the best performance of everyone on the management team the flawed evaluation system cost the ford motor company tens of millions of dollars when the lawsuits were finally settled together the suits represented one of the largest and potentially costliest whitecollar civil actions against a major company in us history and it cost jacques nasser his job nasser submitted his resignation in october  however some sources report he was dumped by ford despite this nasser received a us million golden handshake when he left he was succeeded by william clay ford jr later career following his career with ford motor company nasser worked with one equity partners the private equity arm of jpmorgan chase as a partner
