alleviating symptom distress resulting from multiple symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients and their families to meet patients multiple needs it is generally believed that the care

to combine pd pathway blockade with a vaccination strategy because vaccines have been shown to be able to recruit immune effector cells into the tumor microenvironment   in a similar framework it has

reorienting the immune system in the treatment of cancer by using antipd and antipdl antibodiesshow abstract hide abstract abstract physiologically the programmed death  pd pathway is involved in limiting the killing of bystander cells during an infection and controlling autoimmunity however cancers exploit this system to avoid immune killing and pd ligand  and  pdl and pdl expression on tumor cells as well as pd expression on tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes have shown to be negative prognostic factors promising clinical results have been obtained by pd pathway blockade in a range of cancers while still maintaining a manageable toxicity profile and two antipd antibodies are now approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of metastatic melanoma as already shown

warrant a phase iii trial various statistical approaches have been developed for the pickthewinner design but have been criticized for lack of objective comparison among the drug agents methods we developed a bayesian pickthewinner design by integrating a bayesian posterior probability with simon twostage design in a randomized twoarm clinical trial the bayesian posterior probability as the rule to pick the winner is defined as probability of the response rate in one arm higher than in the other arm the posterior probability aims to determine the winner when both arms pass the second stage of the simon twostage design results when both arms are competitive ie both passing the second stage the bayesian posterior probability performs better to correctly identify the winner compared with the fisher exact test in the simulation study in comparison to a standard twoarm randomized design the bayesian pickthewinner design has a higher power to determine a clear winner in application to two studies the approach is able to perform statistical comparison of two treatment arms and provides a winner probability bayesian posterior probability to statistically justify the winning arm
