decision matter of  walker development  trading group inc file  b date  may 8  terrance walker for the protester david g fagan esq department of veterans affairs for the agency kenneth kilgour esq and laura eyester esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest protest challenging the agency’s decision to set aside the procurement for servicedisabled veteranowned small business concerns is denied where the agency had a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from at least two such firms and that award would be made at a fair market price decision walker development  trading group inc of reno nevada protests the terms of request for quotations rfq no vaq8 issued by the department of veterans affairs va for three types of medical devices  the protester contends that the agency’s market research provides insufficient support for the va’s decision to set this requirement aside for servicedisabled veteranowned small business sdvosb concerns we deny the protest background the rfq setaside for sdvosb concerns and issued in accordance with federal acquisition regulations far parts   and  and va acquisition regulations sought quotations for mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry mcot holter monitoring and cardiokey devices for patient care  agency report ar tab  rfq at    the period of performance would be from february   to february  8  id  award would be made to the firm offering the lowestpriced technically acceptable quotation  id at   the rfq stated that offers would be considered technically acceptable if the quoted products and services were brand name or equal  id  the agency assigned north american industry classification system naics code  electromedical and electrotherapeutic apparatus manufacturing to the rfq the rfq advised firms that the small business administration sba had issued a nonmanufacturing rule class waiver for that naics code  id at    the deadline for quotation submission was february    id at  on february  walker filed this protest challenging the adequacy of the agency’s market research  walker asserts that the agency unreasonably concluded that it would receive two or more quotations from sdvosb concerns and that award would be made at a fair market price  the agency argues that the va’s setaside decision had a reasonable basis discussion generally the decision whether to set aside a procurement for sdvosb concerns is a business judgment within the contracting officer’s discretion which we will not disturb absent a showing that it was unreasonable  aero sage llc b b‑ may    cpd ¶  at  starlight corp inc b dec    cpd ¶  at   no particular method of assessing the availability of capable small businesses is required rather the assessment must be based on sufficient facts so as to establish its reasonableness  starlight corp inc supra mountain west helicopters llc trans aero ltd b‑8 b‑8 july    cpd ¶  at   we will not question an agencys set aside determination where the record shows that the evidence before the contracting officer was adequate to support the reasonableness of the conclusion that small business competition reasonably could be expected  starlight corp inc supra  further in making setaside decisions agencies need not make actual determinations of responsibility or decisions tantamount to determinations of responsibility rather they need only make an informed business judgment that there is a reasonable expectation of receiving acceptably priced offers from small business concerns that are capable of performing the contract  inforeliance corp b8 sept    cpd ¶  at   here as explained below walker does not show that the va unreasonably determined that it would receive offers from two or more sdvosb firms at fair and reasonable prices the agency’s market research included a review of the prior acquisition history and searches of the va western states consortium blanket purchase agreement website the national acquisition center contract catalog and the general services administration’s website  ar tab  market research report at   in addition the agency posted a sources sought notice conducted a search on vetbizgov and emailed ninetyone vendors found on vetbizgov with information about the procurement  id at   some of the firms identified in those searches were found to be unable to provide the required equipment  id at   the va however received responses from two interested sdvosb concerns that provided capability statements and price estimates which the agency deemed to be fair and reasonable  id  during this protest the agency provided the protester with the names of the two firms identified in the agency’s market research  walker has not provided a reasonable basis on which to question the agency’s assertion that competition between these two sdvosb firms will not result in award being made at a reasonable price  walker asserts that the agency’s market research failed to consider whether an sdvosb concern would meet the limitation on subcontracting rule and whether an sdvosb nonmanufacturer would be providing the product of an sdvosb concern  protest at   here the agency incorporated by reference far clause  notice of service disabled veteranowned small business set aside and assigned naics code  electromedical and electrotherapeutic apparatus manufacturing to the rfq  far clause  notice of service disabled veteranowned small business set aside states that sdvosb concerns providing products as manufacturers agree that at least  percent of the costs of manufacturing will be performed by the concern or other sdvosb concerns  ordinarily in order to qualify as a small business concern to provide manufactured products or other supply items an offeror must either be the manufacturer or producer of the end item being procured or if it does not manufacture the item being purchased the offeror must comply with what is known as the nonmanufacturer rule   cfr § a  the nonmanufacturer rule provides that the offer of a nonmanufacturer small business concern can be considered provided among other things that the small business concern represents that it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor or that a waiver of this requirement is granted by the sba  usc § a see also  cfr §   where the nonmanufacturing rule applies to a procurement and the agency’s market research fails to consider whether the firms identified in the market research can comply with the rule the market research is unreasonable  triad isotopes inc b july    cpd ¶  at   the sba is permitted to waive the nonmanufacturer rule where the sba has determined that no small business manufacturer or processor can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications or where no small business manufacturer or processor is available to participate in the procurement   usc § sa  when sba issues a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule a firm can supply the product of any size business without regard to the place of manufacture   cfr § b    here as noted above the agency notified offerors that the sba had issued a class waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for the assigned naics code  consequently we see no merit to the protester’s contention that the agency’s market research failed to consider whether the firms identified had the capability to perform and could comply with the rule walker also argues that the agency failed to adequately assess whether the two identified firms could comply with the terms of the solicitation  see comments on ar at   as noted above the agency’s market research considered the capability of the vendors to meet the requirements  the agency was not required to make a  determination of responsibility in the course of conducting market research  inforeliance corp supra  the protest is denied susan a poling general counsel  the rfq incorporated by reference far clause  notice of service disabled veteranowned small business set aside  rfq at    walker initially argued that the agency improperly issued the rfq on a brand name only basis and conducted unreasonable market research when the agency failed to review “equal” products  however as the agency notes the rfq specifically states that the acquisition is for brand name or equal  rfq at     to the extent that walker is arguing that the agency should have assigned a naics code for services and not one for manufacturing we note that is a matter for review by the sba and is not a matter for consideration by our office    cfr § b  further with respect to any of walker’s remaining challenges to the solicitation walker is not an interested party to raise these concerns given that walker is not an eligible sdvosb and therefore is not a prospective offeror   cfr §§ a a see also encompass group llc b mar    cpd ¶  at  find recent legal decisions  » explore related legal resources  » jul
