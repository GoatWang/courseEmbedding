easier to buy by paul hope january    shares  sharing is nice to from yes send me a copy of this email send we respect your privacy all email addresses you provide will be used just for sending this story thanks for sharing oops we messed up try again later as sears struggles to stay relevant and profitable amidst a slew of store closings and disappointing sales figures fans of the famed sears craftsman brand have encountered a struggle of their own—finding the products in stores since  sears has shut down more than  stores meaning loyalists have to search far and wide to find a wellstocked sears store where  percent of craftsman products are currently sold but under the terms of a new deal stanley black  decker will acquire the sears craftsman brand and it might not be long before we see craftsman products starting to appear in bigbox retailers but questions about quality warranties and the future of the brand still abound heres what the future of sears craftsman might look like   product offerings while the craftsman name might conjure up images of wrenches and socket sets hand tools account for only about a third of craftsman’s business stanley black  decker seems to have its eye on craftsman’s presence in the outdoor power equipment market and with good reason this change should increase the availability of craftsman products to the consumer—many of which have done well in our testing says peter sawchuk who directs much of the outdoor power equipment testing for consumer reports indeed craftsmans snow blowers lawn mowers and string trimmers have all earned top marks in our tests and outdoor power equipment accounts for about  percent of craftsmans business black  decker has a more limited presence in outdoor tools and unlike craftsman has none featuring gas engines  where youll find them for the foreseeable future you’ll still need to head to sears to find craftsman products the deal allows sears to continue selling the craftsman brand in all its stores and even once the deal has closed stanley black  decker will need to make arrangements with new retailers and ramp up production currently black  decker tools are already available at walmart target lowes and home depot and in time we might also expect to see sears craftsman tools at those same stores   quality the biggest unknown is whether the deal will affect the quality of sears craftsman products in a recent conference call with investors stanley black  decker ceo jim loree noted that sears currently sources the majority of its craftsman tools from overseas manufacturers and in the very short term stanley black  decker will do the same thing but the company does have a manufacturing base that sears lacks—in addition to stanley and black  decker the company makes tools under the porter cable bostitch and dewalt brands among others and has a longterm plan to make more and more of those tools in the united states if and when they do we’ll be able to get a better sense of where craftsman products fall in our ratings of such products as cordless drills and cordless tool kits   warranties craftsman was something of a pioneer by offering a lifetime warranty on many of its hand tools loyalists might be wondering whether that warranty will remain if sears isn’t around to honor it the answer isn’t so clear the terms of the stanley black  decker acquisition seem to state that the company won’t be required to honor the warranties of craftsman products purchased at sears but it might still do so anyway most of stanley’s hand tools already offer a lifetime warranty and that policy could continue for its new tools manufactured under the craftsman name but in the interim shoppers who want the assurance of a lifetime warranty and are worried about the future of sears might consider different brands   craftsman and black  decker tools we like consumer reports has tested more than  products from craftsman and black  decker heres a sample of some categories where they

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
