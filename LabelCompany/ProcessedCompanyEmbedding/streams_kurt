provide both functional and stylistic value to a bedroom they protect your floor from wear and tear and your feet from a cold floor as well as enhance a room’s personality with the various colors patterns textures shapes and sizes that area rugs come in when choosing a bedroom rug take the following rule of thumb into consideration extend the carpet  inches around the bed for a king or queen bed the rug should extend  inches out from the sides for a twin or a full bed it should extend at least  inches out depending on the size of the room there can be more extension around the bed but most definitely not less as that would make the room look imbalanced and cover the entirety of the rug design with the bed a few other things to consider — what is your lifestyle like do you have pets or children a white carpet might not be the best alternative in this case and a sturdier longlasting material like wool or jute should be considered what is your decor style make sure you choose a rug that complements and enhances your current aesthetic how easy is it to clean consider if your rug will need to be dry cleaned or if standard vacuuming and carpet cleaning will suffice pillows  throwsadding decorative pillows and throw blankets to a bedroom is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your decor however before you start your hunt for the perfect pillow and throw blanket assemblage consider your current bedroom design if you have a neutral color palette of soft grays and whites a few brightly colored pillows or blankets will provide energetic pops of color if you already have a colorful home throwing in some subtler shades and patterns might be exactly what you need to complement your style and put the focal point on your polychromatic decor in general you should place two to six decorative pillows on your bed this will be enough to add a new element of style and color but not so much that you’ll have to spend  minutes removing pillows before you go to sleep throw blankets can be great arranged at the end of your bed showcasing their texture and pattern or elegantly draped over an armchair ready to snuggle up withtable lampstable lamps are one of those great decor items with a dual purpose — they are a complementary accent to your home while providing muchneeded light when choosing lamps consider this design rule you should not be able to see the neck of the light bulb or bulb socket from a standing or seated position if you can see it the lamp is likely too tall for your room and will cause glare for anyone standing or sitting in your bedroom most likely you however if you find a tall base that you just have to have get a larger lamp shade to cover the bulb and you’re all set tall lamps definitely contribute to an elegant ambience and elevate your room design to new heights literally if you want mood lighting or just a more decorative piece utilize an opaque shade if you’re an avid reader or need more light in your room use a translucent lampshade that distributes light throughout the space wall decor  mirrorsthe decor in your bedroom should be reflective of this space’s purpose  your bedroom is your refuge your retreat from the real world and it should make you feel happy content and inspired put up items that create a sense of peace if you have any specific pictures or pieces that make you happy or remind you of fun times these are great to include in your design if you have a large piece of wall art to hang put it in a place where it can be a focal point and won’t be overshadowed by clutter or other decor hanging and placing mirrors throughout your bedroom will reflect light and make it look larger as well as provide you ample opportunity to check out your outfit before work embed photo open photo in

personalized style right is to pick the pieces that you can’t live without regardless of their medium or composition drawings paintings prints and posters have just as much of a right to be together as peanut butter and jelly that’s not to say that a collection of coordinating photographs can’t look just as stunning but it’s ultimately your preference that mattersthink beyond the typical home

for corn masa processing byproduct streams by kurt a rosentrater skip to main content selected works of kurt a rosentrater follow contact dissertation developing valueadded processing techniques for corn masa processing byproduct streams retrospective theses and dissertations kurt a rosentrater iowa state university download degree type dissertation date of award  degree name doctor of philosophy department agricultural and biosystems engineering first advisor thomas l richard second advisor carl j bern subject categories agriculture bioresource and agricultural engineering food processing and food science abstract the objective of this project was to develop valueadded disposalreuse alternatives for corn masa processing residues ie waste or byproduct slurries to accomplish this the project was divided into four distinct phases the first phase entailed identification and quantification of relevant physical and nutritional properties of typical corn masa processing residues as a result these byproducts appear suitable for use as livestock feed additives or components thereof these byproducts are very high in moisture content but dried they are high in fiber and would probably be best suited for ruminant diets additionally when dried these products have a substantial calcium content so there may exist potential for use as a calcium source for livestock rations the second phase encompassed blending and extruding corn masa processing byproducts with soybean meal on a laboratoryscale and investigating the effects of blend ratio extrusion temperature and extruder screw speed on extrusion processing variables and final extrudate product physical and nutritional characteristics the third phase entailed blending and extruding corn masa processing byproducts with soybean meal on a pilotscale and investigating the effects of blend ratio extrusion temperature and extruder screw speed on extrusion processing variables and final extrudate product physical and nutritional characteristics extrusion processing during these stages produced extrudates with nutritional properties similar to the raw ingredient blends excellent durability and little product expansion the final phase of the project encompassed development of a computer model to assess the economics of various disposal and recycling alternatives for corn masa processing byproducts it was determined that under the current economic climate direct shipping of the raw byproduct slurry is the most economical disposal option for masa processing residues publisher digital repository  iowa state university
