november    et  source lazarus investment partners lllp denver nov   globe newswire  lazarus investment partners lllp the largest shareholder of perceptron inc nasdaqprcp with ownership of approximately  of the outstanding shares today announced that it delivered a letter to the companys chairman richard marz and the companys ceo harry t rittenour the full text of the letter follows november     richard marz chairman harry t rittenour ceo   perceptron inc  halyard drive plymouth mi  gentlemen i am writing to the board of directors of the company to request that perceptron inc prcp or the company immediately engage a prominent investment bank with a clear mandate to sell part or all of the company lazarus investment partners lllp currently owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of perceptron we believe this makes us the companys largest shareholder we have owned shares in the company for over eight years  prcps stock is deeply undervalued and meaningful opportunities exist to unlock shareholder value which are in the control of the companys board of directors and management despite marketleading technology and valuable intellectual property prcps stock has dramatically underperformed its peers and the overall market over an extended time period we do not feel that the current slate of directors possess the requisite skill sets to assist the company in evaluating opportunities to improve performance and shareholder value i have approached the company on a number of occasions and asked for some new perspective to be brought to the board currently the average tenure for the boards directors is approximately  years in fact four directors mr oswald mr decocco mr smith and mr beattie have served since july  or july  during which time shareholders have witnessed a decline in the value of their holdings of approximately  while the russell  has increased over  the most recently appointed board member mr ratigan previously served on the board prior to  mr ratigan was a board member when the company went public further demonstrating the boards inability to go outside of a very shallow well for leadership direction  i have also asked for the company to utilize its sizeable cash position currently around  per share to create shareholder value or to return the money to the shareholders yet the company still has not been able to even achieve the previously announced  million stock buyback simply stated we have had enough of the inertia that has enveloped the company i am tired of the same group think that has only provided shareholders a decreased share price since the majority of the current directors joined the board i am appalled at management and the boards inability at monetizing significant intrinsic value of perceptrons technology and intellectual property i can no longer accept the persistent tunnel vision and inability to diversify and utilize the companys technology outside of the auto sector and the current feeble and failing attempt in the construction and trade industry thus far shareholders have no recognizable value for the millions of dollars in salaries and board fees we have born over the years enough is enough for several years management has invested in rd with the promise that a new product is around the corner yet sales have declined from  million in  when the current chairman and current ceo took control to  million in the last fiscal year the share price has decreased approximately  over this time frame and the company has only entered one new business line the companys diversification into the trade sector appears to not only be poorly timed but illconceived with its first major vendor leaving the company the cbu unit has cost the company millions of dollars over the last three years in a failed attempt to diversify away from the auto sector we encourage the company to diversify and leverage its technological prowess but pursuing the trade sector when the construction market is in freefall does not seem to be the diversification anyone would desire therefore it is terribly disheartening to learn that our years of trust and patience have been in vain as management has instead expended millions of dollars worth of shareholders assets and has not successfully diversified or grown the company  as we discussed with the management team on several occasions during  since perceptron went public nearly  years ago the company has created virtually zero shareholder value during your time as chairman you have made in excess of  in cash compensation in addition to share grants during his time as ceo mr rittenour has received in excess of  million in cash compensation in addition to share grants in fact mr rittenour has received a generous raise every year since becoming ceo even while the company has struggled during the economic downturn it appears that the benefits reaped by the companys customers officers  directors and employees have come at the expense of its shareholders quarter after quarter year after year decade after decade perceptron has failed its shareholders and it is time to deliver the value for which the shareholders have so patiently waited i no longer have any confidence that management or the board of directors have the knowledge interest or skill set necessary for creating shareholder value a glaring example of managements apathy towards creating shareholder value can be seen on the companys website where the investor presentation has not been updated since december  this lack of even the most fundamental investor relations effort is truly astonishing  frankly the decades of dismal results and the current share price speak for itself this is a public company and the board of directors of perceptron has a fiduciary responsibility first and foremost to its shareholders if management and the board of directors really believe that the company is on the proper path to success and we and the rest of the world just dont get it feel free to make the shareholders an offer and take the company private we are confident that perceptron will find a prominent investment bank that is very eager to take on this transaction the outofpocket expenses for engaging an investment bank to explore the sale of part of all of the company will be minimal we have nothing to lose and we can always turn down an offer we deem inadequate its time for change and we expect the board to live up to its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders and maximize the value of the company i have no interest in engaging in a proxy fight where the companys management and board of directors squanders millions of prcps cash resources to protect their jobs after eight long and frustrating years as a patient shareholder of this company i am simply requesting that we explore our strategic alternatives i am very hopeful that management and the board of directors will comply with this request and we can continue a friendly and constructive dialogue with the company please feel free to call me with any questions sincerely justin b borus managing partner lazarus investment partners lllp lazarus investment partners lllp
