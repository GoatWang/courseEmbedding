video for breast augmentation mastopexy incisions cresent incision   probably the least common incision since very little true lift can be obtained it does slightly lift the nipple position and implants can be placed through the same location if needed   periareolar donut incision   hidden along the color change of the areola can be a very discreet scar in some patients it can provide several cm of lifting to the nipple and also reduce the excess skin of the breast with a small scar implants can be placed through here as well   vertical lolipop incision   probably the most common incision since more lifting can be performed with this incision and more sagging breast skin can be removed commonly performed with implant placement for more upper pole fullness   anchor incision   the most traditional scar that can remove the maximum amount of skin and provide the most lifting if needed implants can also be used and placed through the same incisions   if implants are needed do they go under the muscle or above the muscle submuscular below the muscle breast augmentation   in  of the cases the breast  implants will be placed in a submuscular position for  main reasons   more natural appearance less risk of capsular contracture scarring around the breast implant       dual plane breast augmentation   this occurs when the implant is placed behind the muscle in the top  of the implant and behind the gland in the lower  of the implant this is performed by surgeons who have experience in this technique in those patients who do not wants the scars from a breast lift but still want implants and they have some mild sagging to the breasts the dual place creates a lifting and rotation of the breast tissue       subglandular above the muscle breast augmentation   this is performed infrequently due to the higher risk of capsular contracture there are some patients who do benefit from this type of placement   constricted or tubular breasts better expansion with this technique sagging of the breasts but not interested in a lift these patients can have too much sagging they need to have ticker breast tissue to cover the implant surgery details   anesthesia general

what you need to know procedure time    hour recovery time    week approx cost        payment options eyelid surgery  blepharoplasty   eyelid surgery or blepharoplasty perks up drooping eyelids and minimizes puffy bags below your eyes by removing fat and excess skin and muscle from your upper and lower eyelids the procedure can make you look younger and more alert however it will not lift droopy eyebrows or erase crow’s feet or dark circles under your eyes to correct droopy eyebrows you may want to consider a brow lift   most eyelid surgery patients at augusta plastic surgery are  or older though some have the surgery at a younger age if baggy eyelids are a family trait if you are physically healthy and emotionally stable you should be a good candidate     what does eyelid surgery involve   the incisions are made in the creases of your upper lids and right below the lashes of your lower lids the doctor removes excess fat and trims baggy skin and muscle then closes the incisions   if you need fat but not skin removed from your lower lids we may recommend a procedure called a transconjunctival blepharoplasty the doctor makes an incision inside your lower lid and removes the excess fat leaving no visible scar   eyelid surgery typically takes one to three hours though that depends on whether you are having all four lids done or just the upper or lower ones it is usually performed on an outpatient basis     what should i expect after my eyelid surgery   right after the surgery your eyes will be lubricated with ointment and possibly bandaged the lids may feel sore and tight but your discomfort can be offset with medication   your stitches will be removed within a week after which the bruising and swelling will begin to fade you should be able to watch television or read in two or three days and return to work within a couple weeks strenuous activity must wait three weeks   your scars will look slightly pink for at least six months after the surgery but

  see before  after photos   patient portal  forms schedule online now got a question augusta plastic surgery blog guest post  from a familiar face rachel harper  tuesday october     those who are long time patients who read this may know me they may have sat across from me while i gave them their surgical quote or signed them up for brilliant distinctions perhaps we talked on the phone or at length about the procedure of interest invariably or in most cases i would get asked the same question is he good i took pride in my answer because i too was a patient before becoming an augusta plastic surgery employee and could answer with a resounding yes and i was not embarrassed to share my experience because i knew what it was like to consider cosmetic surgery   when i look back at my surgery my goal was to feel like me again after nursing two children things were just no longer the same a family member referred me to dr ewart everyone there made me feel comfortable but i struggled with spending that much money on myself the risk of anesthesia and my own religious beliefs my body is a temple a droopier temple than what i wanted nervous was an understatement knowing what i know now and how pleased i am with the outcome i never would have hesitated   throughout my time at aps there was a common theme amongst our patients for their reasons why they were there even with the most modest of patients they all wanted to feel better about themselves the desire did not discriminate from male or female young or old ive seen a young high school aged guy go from shy and embarrassed to walking tall after one patient received a juvederm injection the patient was staring into the mirror crying she looked at me and told me in amazement she no longer looked sad   although the perception of cosmetic or plastic surgery may be related to crude jokes about overworked celebrities the reality is it is extraordinarily common especially with injectables like botox and fillers patients ranged from young to mature male and female married couples and the like all trying to erase the s their forehead buttcrack crows feet bunny lines laugh lines etc coming for an injection is easier and quicker than a cut and color from a top salon and certainly lasts longer   after i left the practice to be a stay at home mom i committed to a personal goal of becoming fit this was not just a go to the gym goal it was a lose weight gain muscle and while i was doing it go ahead and compete in a fitness competition i know it was a crazy commitment but i wanted to see how far i could push myself   about  months later and  pounds lighter i went to visit augusta plastic for a little bit of competitive edge the weight loss had my face looking gaunt and tired and i knew a bit of botox juvederm and voluma could freshen up my face right before competition amazing how a few needle pricks can help ones perspective i felt and looked so much better my cheeks were full and healthy the forehead lines were smoothed and there were fewer lines around my mouth    happy is an understatement        comments   trackbacks   permalink bikini competitions are the new black madeleine giovannelli  monday december   bikini     the world of bikini competitions is one many of us only see from the outside but take one step inside and you can check off your motivationmonday for the week meet lecai williams a crsa woman who went from being an avid gymgoer an accomplishment in itself for many to placing  th among competitors at her first bikini competition in atlanta she gives us some insight into the world of sparkly costumes clean eating and days of devoted training that she loves so much   competitors all have their own goals and purpose for themselves when they decide to compete for williams it was the desire to take it to a different level already an athlete she sought to reach an even higher goal many women across the country are doing the same “i really think that a lot of moms and women are getting involved because of health risks says williams heart disease high blood pressure all the risk factors with women working out decreases those factors so i really think that that its just wanting to live a healthier lifestyle”     what does that look like for a bikini competitor “i had to be disciplined and i mean mentally and physically i was very disciplined recalls williams” she will readily admit to how difficult it was eating six small meals and drinking a gallon to a gallon and a half of water each day to stay hydrated she completely changed her routine a routine that already involved life as a busy mother working as both the office manager and secretary of corporation at one smile away inc “there were so many different entities that went into it not just working out but my eating habits had to change i had to do that for at least four months the last month was the hardest because as i got closer to the competition there was a decrease in carbs so my energy level went down of course because i didn’t have that fuel”   our only question is how “i had a nutrition plan you really have to want it i tell anybody you really have to want the change because it’s a lifestyle change” williams can laugh now but remembers actually crying when her husband would bring pizza into the house a struggle we can all relate to “you want it but you have this goal that you’re working towards and you want to master it” in addition to the dedicated eating regimen williams also attributes much of her success to her posing coach katie at be bella fitness boutique as well as the help of a her online fitness coach christina   carol johnson who founded supernatural bodybuilding and fitness snbf with her husband in  knows the sacrifices necessary to succeed in these competitions better than most “i think what keeps us going here and motivates us is that people begin to live these healthy lifestyles eating healthier and exercising” said johnson snbf works with some competitors from start to finish with the competition prep workshops they put on seeing positive changes first hand “confidence shoots to a totally different level both mentally and physically” said johnson   williams would agree not only did she build muscle she built her confidence something all women desire and few have actually attained “if anything it boosted my confidence just seeing myself in the mirror and looking at my transformation it’s just been great” and trust us williams exemplifies poise to find something you are truly passionate about is a gift for that passion to be something that contributes to your health and well being is even better we are all about bettering yourself for yourself whatever that looks like for you     williams is all set to compete again in the new year with snbf her advice to those considering their first competition it’s something every woman needs to hear “don’t compare yourself to anyone else do this for yourself and just stay focused you have to stay focused and disciplined and don’t let anything deter you it’s very important because we all have different body types i’m shorter and i’m heavier on the bottom so of course i’m going to be different i’m not going to look like the other ones or i’m not as thin don’t compare yourself do it for you be consistent”   comments   trackbacks   permalink october madeleine giovannelli  monday october   some people think instantly of orange and black halloween or bonfires and fall festivities pink is the other color associated with this month all over the football fields from high schools to the nfl many are wearing their pink to support breast cancer awareness month university hospital is proudly displaying its pink banner across the front of the building we are nearing the end of the month and the initial excitement over the new pops of pink all over the place has probably begun to fade looking beyond the ribbons nike socks and football cleats are the people they represent for a plastic surgeon the realities of breast cancer can be close it’s a special gift to be able to give someone back what they once had but lost because of the extent of not only the surgeries but also the number of follow up appointments our physicians typically get to know these patients better than any others while it might be a difficult job rewarding is how dr ewart describes it   “breast cancer patients are typically overwhelmed anxious and worried when i first meet with them because of the new found circumstances they are now in everything is new to them and they don’t know what to expect the initial consultation is typically longer than most consults because of the variety of options to reconstruct the breast the options available also are very dependent of the type of cancer will they need radiation or chemotherapy do they want to remove just one or both breasts their current breast size their desired breast size and the amount of extra abdominal fat they have an important part of this process is education and also support groups from other patients who have been through the same thing” our job then is to guide them through it all   it might surprise you to know that most breast cancer patients don’t actually have reconstructive surgery at least not right away some need time to think on it or may just be weary of recurring cancer the most common method of reconstruction is the tissue expander which is achieved through saline injections it takes two to three months to expand the skin and underlying muscle once this is done a permanent prosthesis can be placed after one month they can begin reconstruction of the nipple and two weeks from that point they can begin the tattoo process to try to make the color as it was before “satisfaction is high says dr smith even when the reconstruction isn’t done right away it gives patients hope knowing it can be done”   to our breast cancer patients we admire your strength and are proud to be on this journey with you   comments   trackbacks   permalink ​what is the one product that will solve all my problems madeleine giovannelli  tuesday october   it cant fix everything but its skincare powers are impressive   we ask this question everywhere but likely most often when we are starring at a vast array of skin care products with a look of exasperation in our eyes we all know that following a skin care regimen will help to get us the best results but is there one thing that might help get us on the right track the answer may just be a derivative of vitamin a     listed as one of the top  antiaging breakthroughs by webmd retinols are extremely effective in reducing fine lines wrinkles and dark spots one study showed after  weeks retinol had improved crows feet fine lines by  and mottled pigmentation by  with over  of subjects showing  grades of improvement in many parameters additionally at week  histochemical data confirmed the clinical results showing increased expression of type i procollagen hyaluronan and ki as compared to vehicle   in other words the antiaging properties are real   these days it seems that regardless of your age you were supposed to start using antiaging products yesterday the issue with that for many  and  somethings is that many are still trying to get their acne under control they then face the dilemma antiaging products and acne or clear skin and falling behind on the proactive wrinkle prevention bandwagon when it comes to our faces we don’t ever want to compromise we don’t want to deal with acne or wrinkles retinol can help both   how does it work retinol works by aiding in cell turnover it helps to get rid of dead skin cells and promote the growth of new ones this creates that glowing look everyone is after and wipes away all of the dullness getting rid of dead skin cells means less clogged pores one of the biggest causes of acne collagen production is boosted as well thickening the skin like it or not retinol use gives you just one more very compelling reason to use a sunscreen daily we all know we shouldn’t leave the house without it but for many when they can’t see the damage being done it can be hard to be diligent think of it like this this product is shown to reduce photodamage so why allow any more   many people experience peeling and dryness at first but this only means the retinol is doing the job when these side effects do show up all it takes is a few days of backing off to see these dwindle don’t let the potential of dry skin scare you away your face will tell you when to slow down and when it has become used to the product begin with a lower strength and work your way up trust us we think it will be worth the wait          comments   trackbacks   permalink why everyone will be talking about chins this year madeleine giovannelli  monday september   because the game has changed let’s face it you’re not going to the gym to hammer out your double chinfighting exercises and that’s okay the fda has recently approved an injection to dissolve submental fullness aka your double chin yes you read that right expected to be just as big as botox the new drug by kythera biopharmaceuticals kybella is the first of its kind and is hitting select facilities this fall augusta plastic surgery is one of them     kybella is made up of deoxycholic acid which our bodies actually naturally produce to absorb and break down fat this artificial version is injected right underneath the chin much like the results of coolsculpting the fat cells are killed and excreted through the body kybella is different than its other injectable counterparts in that once the results are evident there is not a need to continue treatments because the fat cells eliminated can no longer store fat most patients will require between two and four treatments spaced one month apart and only lasting about  minutes each up to six treatments can be given so what kind of research is out there quite a bit check out these stats released by kythera   kybella is supported by a global clinical development program that includes over  clinical studies with more than  patients worldwide of which over  have been treated with kybella in the pivotal phase iii studies  percent of patients responded to kybella based on a composite of validated physician and patient measurements patients treated with kybella reported an improvement in the amount of fat in the area under the chin patients also reported improvement in the emotional impact of submental fat when asked how happy bothered selfconscious embarrassed old and overweight they felt following treatment in relation to the amount of their submental fat     sign us up in a  survey administered by the american society for dermatologic surgery  of respondents reported dissatisfaction with excess fat under the chin this common dissatisfaction is not limited by a greater age or weight but can be a result of genetics regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle should always be a staple but some areas can be hard to address the cara delevingne chiseled jawline is in reach we know it’s brand new but it’s worth noting that kybella has already received a  worth it rating on realselfcom   a report from one of our staff members who volunteered to be the first to try our newest procedure   initial thoughts painless she did not feel much aside from the first numbing shot administered the area was a bit red and swollen    day post procedure the area injected felt a bit hard there were

you’re there front and center for every new class at the gym but that stomach has looked the same for years and you’re tired of the muffin top think of it as a fresh start you’ll continue to exercise just like before but that stubborn pooch is now gone and it really is gone the fat cells treated are excreted from the body put down the ipad and the ever popular contouring tutorials       you love the return of fall because it means big sweaters and riding boots but then you remember what goes in between the two skinny jeans cue the dreaded dance required to get them up our legs the fat cell itself does not weigh much so you won’t necessarily notice dramatic weight loss from your coolsculpting treatment but you will see inches lost which we all know is the key to squeezing into the jeans

imaging for breast augmentation christopher ewart  friday november   a most enthusiasticyes first off what is d imaging the vectra xt takes  instant images and creates a d replica of your chest on a large video screen we can then rotate the image and show what any size implant would look like on your chest why would i need this you can get a realistic view of what the results will look like and can pick the right size the very first time no morei wish i picked a larger size how accurate is it a recent study places the accuracy at about  which is what we have been seeing here at augusta plastic surgery other reasons more planning and discussion can be done about any asymmetry and if different sizes are needed we can address those before surgery view the potential results from the front side angles birds eye view look at different profiles to see about creating more cleavage so lets see an example this is a young lady who wanted to go from a  a cup to a full c cup we discussed using silicone implants placed behind the muscle to create the most natural feel and look with her body type i showed her some images with  cc implants which would give her a full c and she felt that might not be large enough this is a  cc midprofile silicone implant using the d imaging she felt this was more of the size she wanted which would put her closer to a small d in some bras here are her before d and after images side by side   if you are considering having this surgery get the d imaging first augusta plastic surgery breast augmentation with d imaging dr christopher j ewart md augusta plastic surgery  comments   trackbacks   permalink moderate versus moderate plus versus high profile implants christopher ewart  sunday october   disclaimer let your plastic surgeon help you decide which implant shape and projection is the best for your body if you are the patient who has gone the extra mile and researched every possible option involved in breast augmentation then this webpage is for you you either want to know why your surgeon has chosen a certain profile implant for you or you want to make that decision yourself well here is what you need to know plain and simple as possible there are basically three implant profiles and  types of material silicone gel and saline moderate flat and wide moderate plus inbetween high profile narrow and more projecting    notice above the saline implants are much taller and more projecting than the silicone implants if all of these are  cc implants then the high profile silicone will have the same projection as the moderate plus saline you may want to reread that last sentence to completely understand look at this photo all patients in their s who are approximately   lb and go from an a cup to a c cup with  cc implants     this photo shows why i lean toward placement of moderate plus saline and high profile silicone implants if possible too flat sometimes with the moderate silicone and too much projection sometimes with the high salines but remembernot always you can actually get great results with every type of implant when placed in the right patient your body shape measurements current and desired cup sizes and skin quality all come in to play when determining which implants are best for you at augusta plastic surgery we listen to what you want and can help you choose the right implant for you comments

nose i dont like profile view of my nose in pictures difficulty breathing through my nose history of a broken nose my nose is too flat imaging rhinoplasty what you need to know procedure time    hours recovery time    week basic  weeks full approx cost      payment options d imaging included with your consult interested in d imaging for your rhinoplasty   we can provide projected images of how a rhinoplasty can change your appearance with our vectra d in the vectra illustration the images shown below are the preop profile rhinoplasty and then rhinoplasty combined with chin augmentation nose surgery   also known as rhinoplasty nose reshaping or nose job   when to consider nose surgery   if you are unhappy with the shape size or angle of your nose if your nose is too large too small or not in proportion to the rest of your face if you have breathing problems resulting from irregularities inside your nose if you have a nasal hump or a nasal tip that is drooping too elevated or wide   related procedures   many people who consider a rhinoplasty also consider chin augmentation brow lift or eyelid surgery     am i a good candidate for nose surgery   the following are some common reasons why you may want to consider rhinoplasty   your nose is too large or too small your nose does not seem to fit with the rest of your face your nose is crooked badly shaped or out of alignment you have nasal blockage inside your nose and have trouble breathing you have a birth defect that you would like improved you would like improvement not perfection in the appearance of your nose   if you are in good general health have a positive attitude and realistic expectations you are most likely a good candidate for this procedure   how is a nose surgery procedure performed   after numbing the area your surgeon will make incisions to access the bones and cartilage that support the nose there are two general techniques for making the incisions open and endonasal   by adding or removing bone and cartilage and adjusting the supporting structures inside the nose the size of your nose can be reduced or increased and the nose may be shortened or lengthened   tip grafts made of cartilage can be used to remodel the tip of your nose making it more uplifted longer shorter or thinner your skin and other soft tissues will remodel to assume the shape of the underlying structure in some patients tissue fillers or fat grafts can be added to increase volume in desired areas   what are my options   there are two main incision approaches the open approach and the internal endonasal approach   in addition to incision options there are various methods for augmenting your nose or smoothing surface deformities   autologous cartilage grafts taken from your nasal septum the wall inside the nose that divides one air passage from the other offers the best chance for a natural result if cartilage and bone have already been removed from the nasal septum then ear or rib cartilage and sometimes bone from the skull are other options although solid silicone implants are available for nasal surgery these are foreign materials that may become infected or react poorly with your nasal tissues and have to be removed that is why natural cartilage if a supply is available is the most troublefree option fillers or fat grafts may also be injected to smooth the nose to camouflage deformities or indentations or to add volume in desired areas   how do i prepare for a nose surgery procedure   your surgeon will provide thorough preoperative instructions answer any questions you may have take a detailed medical history and perform a physical exam to determine your fitness for surgery   in advance of your procedure your surgeon will ask you to   stop smoking at least six weeks before undergoing surgery to promote better healing avoid taking aspirin certain antiinflammatory drugs and some herbal medications that can cause increased bleeding regardless of the type of surgery to be performed hydration is very important before and after surgery for safe recovery   rhinoplasty is usually performed on an outpatient basis be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and to stay with you at least the first night following surgery if your surgery involves septal work or is a revision of prior work it may require an overnight stay   what can i expect on the day of rhinoplasty surgery   your rhinoplasty will be performed in our aaaa certified outpatient ambulatory surgery center most rhinoplasty procedures take at least one to four hours to complete but may take longer   medications are administered for your comfort during the surgical procedure general anesthesia is commonly used during rhinoplasty although local anesthesia or intravenous sedation may be desirable in some instances for your safety during the surgery various monitors will be used to check your heart blood pressure pulse and the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood your surgeon will follow the surgical plan discussed with you before your operation after your procedure is completed you will be taken into a recovery area where you will continue to be closely monitored you will have a splint placed outside your nose to support its new shape as it heals nasal packing may also be used inside the nose to provide additional support   you will probably be permitted to go home after a short observation period unless you and your plastic surgeon have made other plans for your immediate postoperative recovery   aftercare and recovery   your surgeon will discuss how long it will be before you can return to your normal level of activity and work after surgery you and your caregiver will receive detailed instructions about your postoperative care including information about   normal symptoms you will experience potential signs of complication   immediately after rhinoplasty after surgery you may be asked to wear a nasal splint over your nose for support the splint will protect your nose while you sleep and shield it from accidental bumps you may also have a small triangular bandage beneath the tip of your nose nasal packing will be placed inside your nose for additional support it acts as an internal splint to hold everything in place and to keep the airway clean and free of crusts expect some swelling and bruising and possibly some discomfort your face will be puffy and the areas around your nose and eyes will be bruised and swollen after surgery we may recommend cold compresses to help minimize the swelling and reduce pain you may need to keep your head elevated and relatively still for the first few days after surgery we will prescribe a pain medication to deal with any pain you may experience you will have to limit your activities for a few days to weeks   recovery time frame after rhinoplasty it is vitally important that you follow all patient care instructions provided to you we will also provide detailed instructions about the normal symptoms you will experience and any potential signs of complications it is important to realize that the amount of time it takes for recovery varies greatly among individuals you will need to wait for several weeks before you can engage in exercise or athletics   the first two weeks all surgical packing within your nose will be removed within four to seven days after surgery the splint and bandages on your nose will be removed in a week to ten days it takes about ten to fourteen days before most of the swelling and bruising improves your return to work or school depends on how much exertion your job or your school activities require most normal activities including exercise can usually be resumed within three weeks you should avoid strenuous exercise straining bending and lifting until cleared to do so by your plastic surgeon   after the first two weeks minor swelling of your nose may persist for up to a year but most likely will not be noticeable to others it will be a few months before you can expose your reshaped nose to direct sunlight and it may be a number of weeks before you can wear glasses without special support such as tape if the bones in your nose were

or bonfires and fall festivities pink is the other color associated with this month all over the football fields from high schools to the nfl many are wearing their pink to support breast cancer awareness month university hospital is proudly displaying its pink banner across the front of the building we are nearing the end of the month and the initial excitement over the new pops of pink all over the place has probably begun to fade looking beyond the ribbons nike socks and football cleats are the people they represent for a plastic surgeon the realities of breast cancer can be close it’s a special gift to be able to give someone back what they once had but lost because of the extent of not only the surgeries but also the number of follow up appointments our physicians typically get to know these patients better than any others while it might be a difficult job rewarding is how dr ewart describes it   “breast cancer patients are typically overwhelmed anxious and worried when i first meet with them because of the new found circumstances they are now in everything is new to them and they don’t know what to expect the initial consultation is typically longer than most consults because of the variety of options to reconstruct the breast the options available also are very dependent of the type of cancer will they need radiation or chemotherapy do they want to remove just one or both breasts their current breast size their desired breast size and the amount of extra abdominal fat they have an important part of this process is education and also support groups from other patients who have been through the same thing” our job then is to guide them through it all   it might surprise you to know that most breast cancer patients don’t actually have reconstructive surgery at least not right away some need time to think on it or may just be weary of recurring cancer the most common method of reconstruction is the tissue expander which is achieved through saline injections it takes two to three months to expand the skin and underlying muscle once this is done a permanent prosthesis can be placed after one month they can begin reconstruction of the nipple and two weeks from that point they can begin the tattoo process to try to make the color as it was before “satisfaction is high says dr smith even when the reconstruction isn’t done right away it gives patients hope knowing it can be done”   to our breast cancer patients we admire your strength and are proud to be on this journey with you   comments   trackbacks   permalink comments post has no
