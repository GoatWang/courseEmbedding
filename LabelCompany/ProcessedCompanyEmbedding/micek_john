to the telegram may   … john micek this column is all about taking the time to look upsure theres plenty enough down here on our little blue and green rock to hold our attentionpresident donald trump made his first tour through europe and the middle east a congressional candidate in montana slugged a reporter there was a horrific bombing in england that killed teens and children and the model kendall jenner did something in cannes that was apparently worth of our attention but news this week that the weirdest star in the sky is acting up again and that theres an outside chance however tiny however remote that it might be the product of alien civilization is ample reason to pause and look upin case you missed it and who could blame you if you did scientists are eagerly tracking the activities of a star some  light years from earth in the constellation cygnus that strangely blinks in and out like a dying light bulbsometimes as the washington post reports its brightness dips by as much as  percentand scientists have absolutely no idea why its happeningthe star a yellowwhite dwarf by the way bears the boring scientific designation kic but i prefer its much homier and affectionate nickname tabbys star for the the yale university astronomer tabetha boyajian who first discovered it back in tabbys star did its dimming thing again last week the post and other outlets reported and as much as astronomers go bananas they went absolutely bonkers over this news thats because the could observe the dimming as it happenedso they started crowdsourcing observers encouraging them to train their telescopes at the star and to take down what they sawamong them is jason wright a penn state astronomer whos part of seti or the search for extraterrestrial intelligence projecthe has the coolest theory by far  that it might be an alien megastructure possibly a huge array of orbiting solar panels maybe constructed by an alien civilization that harvests the energy from a nearby starancient alien civilizations could be arbitrarily advanced and so its not clear what physics were allowed to assume wright wrote we dont know why they would create megastructures though energy collection seems like a good guess to me so we have no good reason to expect any particular shape or size for them imagine that it is advantageous to collect solar energy to be used for some purpose and that there is enough material to do so but not an infinite supply he continued imagine that the panels have a range of sizes and orbit the star in a range of orbital periodsbut even if its not aliens the recent activity at tabbys star gave astronomers a rare opportunityand whatever data they collect will go a long way toward explaining how and why it happens comet activity is another hypothesisno matter what scientists figure out its going to be pretty mindblowing and it will undoubtedly expand our knowledge of the cosmos but heres what i really love about stories like this however briefly we put aside all the stuff that divides us and turn our collective gaze upward pausing from our arguments to collectively marvel at the enormity and magnificence of creation and our own relatively minor place within iti have this friend who lives in a tucked away corner of central pennsylvania where theres hardly any houses and no development for miles and miles he has by far one of the best views of the heavens that ive ever seenit stops me in my tracks every timeand on clear and depthless night you can look up and see this blanket of stars blinking back at you you can watch as the planets make their transit across the sky and you can remember that theyve done this for millennia and will continue to do so long after you and i and everything else is dustthe light thats reaching us now from tabbys star is a message from our own pastit took  years for those fluctuations in starlight to travel from cygnus and if it came from an alien source they too might be long goneand whoever they were maybe they paused to look up and gaze at their own starry sky wondering if someone somewhere might be gazing back at them and what they might be like and what they might be thinkingtheres time enough for quarrels time enough for fighting but those moments when you can pause and look up and give thanks for all those slender and fragile threads that tie us togetherthose

photoalex brandon by john l micek jmicekpennlivecom a year ago this week newly anointed his partys candidate for president donald j trump capped the republican national convention in cleveland by ascending the podium in the quicken loans arena and offering these words nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it a year later as the latest iteration of an obamacare repeal lay in smoking ruins trump said this i think were probably in that position where well let obamacare fail were not going to own it im not going to own it he said tuesday i can tell you the republicans are not going to own it well let obamacare fail and then the democrats are going to come to us but trump along with congressional republicans does own the healthcare bills failure for this simple reason his party controls the white house and capitol hill trump cut democrats out of the process and neither house speaker paul j ryan rwisc nor senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky made any meaningful attempt to include them in talks this white house like the last one has outsourced healthcare to congress us rep charlie dent rpa told msnbc last month thats what happened with this bill congress is largely writing this bill lest you think dent who hails from the moderate th district in pennsylvanias lehigh valley heres tiana lowe writing in the national review which can hardly be confused for liberal rather than begin his tenure with legislation set to gain bipartisan or at least republican approval trump dived into the most complex cornerstones of gop dogma without a real plan or the discipline to sell it to the american people lowe wrote after publicly pressuring paul ryan to ram through a notoriously unpopular bill in the house trump slammed it as mean the senate then had to rewrite major aspects of it  while navigating even more difficult political terrain because republicans have a smaller majority in the upper chamber than they do in the house on wednesday as it became clear that mcconnell faced consistent and steady opposition to repealing obamacare without a replacement in hand pundits faulted trump for failing to do the hard work of selling the bill to voters the fact is donald trump did a terrible job selling healthcare because he didnt really try to sell healthcare joe scarborough the former gop congressman from florida who hosts the daily morning joe gabfest on msnbc observed wednesday in fact trump did the exact opposite of trying to sell the bill to the public  let alone to the congressional republicans with whom he allegedly works in common at various times trump threatened to primary republican holdouts in the house then he said he hoped the senate would come up with a better bill than the mean one passed by the house with that lack of message discipline coupled with the fact that despite seven years of big talk republicans failed to do much else than cobble together a set of unworkable talking points into legislation its no wonder the bill failed constantly distracted never really focused a lot of them complained that he didnt even understand what was inside the bill so he really couldnt rally the base to support it and you know he can talk about  and  but the fact is he is  and  scarborough observed trumps greatest selling point in cleveland  that he was a political outsider a pragmatist and consummate dealmaker who could cure what ailed washington has now become his greatest liability he has thus far demonstrated he is none of those things six months into his presidency trump has vacillated between pushing healthcare and tax reform ending up with neither away from capitol hill questions about his campaigns ties to vladimir putins russia linger and seemingly get worse by the day pathological tweeting has distracted attention away from his legislative agenda in fact here is little evidence that trump has the knowledge or patience to spend the long hours it takes getting a piece of legislation from to get a bill from the conception stage to the finish line nor is there any evidence that he has surrounded himself with those who can passing legislation is a painstaking and deliberative process some members of congress spend years working to get their bills onto the presidents desk sticktoitedness is part of the job description and for those who say give trump a chance it is worth pointing out that at similar points in their respective presidencies trump has signed fewer bills into his law than his predecessors and those he has signed are remarkable for being mostly unremarkable right now trump the president looks more like trump the real estate developer walking away from ruinous deals abdicating responsibility and leaving others holding the bag  thats a long

eitherthe senate bill rolls back the medicaid expansion thats extended coverage to millions of lowincome americans it makes health insurance more expensive offering inferior plans with higher deductibles and spikes obamacares individual mandate it hands a tax break to the wealthiest americans and just for good measure it eliminates federal funding for planned parenthoodthe bill was so bad in fact that even president donald trump apparently felt like he needed to change the subject to something less politically radioactive former fbi director james comey and the russia scandalon wednesday trump tweeted that democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with republicans on healthcaretax cutssecurity obstruction doesnt workby thursday any reference at all to healthcare evaporated and trump pulled a classic dont look here look there tweeting among other things that i did not make and do not have any such recordings of any meeting with comeynonetheless the white house still in search of its first major legislative victory says its open to negotiation the president is pleased to see the process moving forward swiftly in congress and he looks forward to seeing a finalized bill on his desk white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said told the washington posti dont think were as focused on the timeline as we are on the final productwhich may be good news because senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has his work cut out for himthanks to some procedural arcana mcconnell needed  votes to send the bill back to the house the post reported thursday that mcconnell wants to do that before congress july  recess regardless of whether he has the votes or not at this writing it doesnt look like he does and as expected there are zero democratic votesmcconnells fellow kentuckyian us sen rand paul ted cruz of texas ron johnson of wisconsin and mike lee of utah have all said they cant vote for the bill in its current formcurrently for a variety of reasons we are not ready to vote for this bill but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor there are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to americans to repeal obamacare and lower their health care costs the four lawmakers said in a joint statementyet republicans continue to plug away even as a growing number of americans finally realizing that theyll miss obamcare if and and when its gone say they oppose the houseauthored alternativefortyeight percent of respondents to a wall street journalnbc news poll released thursday said the housepassed repeal bill was a bad idea they were more narrowly split in their affection for obamacare saying  percent that it was a good ideabut republicans struggling to make good on a more than halfdecade old pledge to dismantle obamas
