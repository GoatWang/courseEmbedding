technology  texzon texzon technology the texzon wireless power™ system represents a paradigm shift in the science of electromagnetics what it is our texzon wireless power™ system allows the earth itself to be used for clean safe and efficient transfer of power between any two points on the globe wirelessly the system represents a paradigm shift in the science of electromagnetics today’s power distribution system of wired grids is fragile and aging  the transition to a global wireless system utilizing the zenneck surface wave is a breakthrough that will effectively “cut the cord” between power generation facilities and the local distribution grids  this breakthrough will significantly enhance energy surety reliability and resiliency of the world’s electrical distribution systems how it works texzon technologies has developed a system of patentpending processes and equipment to efficiently launch the zenneck surface wave currently our research and commercialization efforts are focused on energy transfer and communications but we recognize that this technology has the potential to impact numerous sectors of the economy a zenneck surface wave is an electromagnetic wave that uses the surface of the earth as a waveguide enabling it to carry communications signals or electrical power efficiently over long distances this wireless power system will employ a “transmitter probe” located near a power generation plant to launch a zenneck carrier wave  receiver antennae will be positioned appropriately around the world to receive the signal and download the power into a local microgrid or conventional grid architecture the wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses emp including those associated with a nuclear detonation  unlike a wired grid the zenneck wave cannot be physically attacked and cyber attacks would be challenged to target or cause cascading failures to a wireless system when launched the zenneck surface wave literally envelops the planet like a balloon enabling transmitter probes to be placed anywhere power can be generated and receivers to be placed anywhere power is needed the history of the zenneck surface wave jonathan zenneck  was one of the first known scientists to study electromagnetic wave propagation over the surface of the earth with zenneck surface waves electrical power is directed along the earth’s surface in much the same way that electrical power is directed through conventional transmission lines using electromagnetic waves in the early years of the twentieth century two theories of electromagnetic wave theory coexisted  classic hertzian radiated waves ground waves which are transmitted via conventional antennae on a line of sight path and dissipate over a distance into space  and zenneck surface waves which use the surface of the earth as a waveguide and travel at high levels of efficiency but had yet to be experimentally observed our technology uses only surface waves guided surface waves and not ground waves radiated waves safe and secure when the power industry looks at safety they focus on two key factors the potential for shock and the local rf field strengths texzon wireless power™ systems meet the most stringent standards for both shock hazard zenneck surface waves don’t deliver a shock for the same reason radio station signals don’t shock you to create a shock there must be a difference in voltage or potential difference between two points to overcome the resistance inherent in the material between the points your head and feet are a good example due to the low field strengths created by texzon wireless power™ systems much like broadcast radio or television the voltage potential between them is not enough to create a shock hazard in contrast when you touch an electrical wire the voltage potential between the wire and your feet can be extremely high meaning current will flow and energy will be dissipated through you this is why great care should always be used when working on traditional electrical wiring only through the use of precisely designed receivers can energy be transferred through zenneck surface waves field intensity the federal communications commission fcc the occupational safety and health administration osha and the american national standard institute ansi have strict guidelines for rf exposure levels these standards have been in place for decades those limits are more than ten times what will be produced by commercial texzon wireless power™ systems commercialization and patents texzon technologies has over  us patents pending and  international patents pending for this wireless technology additional patent applications are in development and more are expected  us patents filed todate wireless power  communications  international patents filed todate st set of enabling patents transmitreceive filed in  countries our science  texas

everywhere by enabling the delivery of affordable electricity throughout the world below are some initial applications we expect the list to grow along with the technology electricity distribution our technology will enable true global access to electricity particularly benefiting the  billion people who still don’t have it clean safe reliable and affordable wireless power systems will remedy this enabling necessities like hot meals advanced medical treatment and pure drinking water for people in the developing world electricity is the foundation for realizing growth and prosperity in the developing world and introducing it to communities without electricity would help boost economies around the world disaster relief what if affected communities had access to electricity immediately after hurricanes katrina and sandy the earthquakes in haiti and japan and the tsunamis in thailand and sumatra thousands of lives could have been saved our technology will allow for electricity to be delivered immediately to disaster areas transforming the scope and efficiency of relief efforts industrial power reliable electricity is the lifeblood of the global economy the texzon wireless power™ system will connect the world’s energy resources with those who need them with a fraction of the environmental impact of current technologies in the case of renewable energy prime locations for generation are often not in close enough proximity to the end user and building traditional transmission infrastructure is not economically viable we can overcome these problems through the use of texzon wireless power systems imagine solar farms in the world’s uninhabited deserts providing electricity to the world’s most populous cities or if wind farms that operate most efficiently at night when energy use is lowest sending  power to parts of experiencing peak daytime use green energy can be truly economical reducing outages natural and manmade events can result in longterm and widespread disruptions of the electrical grid texzon wireless power™ systems will harden the system by providing alternative energy sources when they’re needed as well as help bypass reliance on the aging transmission infrastructure the wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses emp including those associated with a nuclear detonation  unlike a wired grid the zenneck wave cannot be physically attacked and cyber attacks would be challenged to target or cause cascading failures to a wireless system  and obviously a wireless grid would never get old eliminating the problems related to the advanced age of today’s infrastructure   our science  texas symposium presentation on wireless and microwave systems and
