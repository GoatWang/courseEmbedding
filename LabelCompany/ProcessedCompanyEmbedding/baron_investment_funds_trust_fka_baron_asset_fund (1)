little more than sixteen years ago i had no grand plan for baron capital to become what it has i had been a securities analyst since  and a portfolio manageranalyst since  my initial investment successes in the early s were the result of my recognizing a few simple obvious and potentially large ideas mcdonaldswe ate their  hamburgers and  fries and drank their  cokes in high school and i felt demand for their food would be substantial their corporate growth was at an early stage and they just had to be able to raise pricesdisneyi was bullish on the prospects for the new themed amusement park they were building in orlando and for the  acres they owned surrounding that parkfederal expressi thought the idea of overnight and reliable mail service for businesses sounded like a great ideaand mattelthe prospects for barbie seemed to me a lot bigger than most other analysts expected my investment education advanced greatly in the mid sand i finally began to accumulate capitalwhen i met several hardworking brilliant no nonsense live by your word die by your word entrepreneurs with big ideasjay pritzker hyatt hotelsphil berman leader healthcare and hess department storesdavid murdoch flexivan and ibpand steve wynn golden nuggetand invested in their businesses in addition to a big long lasting idea people became the next element of our investment equation our formula continued to evolve i determined to invest in small and midsized businesses rather than larger ones i felt intuitively that smaller businesses had greater potential for growth smaller businesses were also less likely to be priced efficiently since few wall street analysts cared enough to follow their progress i believed investment information gathered through my independent research efforts as a result would often not yet be reflected in a business stock market valuation this offered significant investment advantage i felt then and continue to believe i invested in a relatively concentrated fashion to best take advantage of the opportunities my independent investment research had unearthed i had inadvertently begun to follow the investment precept to put all your eggs in one basket and dont take your eyes off the basket finally following a strictly common sense approach i was only willing to invest in a business that could be purchased at an attractive price i invested in businesses that not part of the prospectus prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd could be expected to double in size every three to five years i determined to purchase shares in these businesses only if we could buy shares at prices that offered my clients the same opportunity baron a long term investorowns major stakes in photo several businesses long term investments continue to offer promise recent investments provide significant embedded opportunity baron capitals investment philosophyand performancehave been built upon a relatively simple and straightforward idea we are long term investors in businesses we do not trade stocks we think of ourselves as part owners of publicly held businessesvery profitable businesses with important barriers to prevent others from usurping our corporate opportunities businesses in which we invest are run by terrific executives entrepreneurial executives we like trust and admireand who are also focused on growth our oldest and largest mutual fund baron asset fund was founded in june  baron asset annual portfolio turnover averaged just  during the past three years this means that we hold an average investment more than five years most mutual funds that invest in small and midsized businesses have annual portfolio turnover of more than those funds hold their investments less than twelve months investors in other funds can rarely know what their funds own investors in baron funds know what they own and even more importantly baron capitals analysts over the years have the opportunity to become more knowledgeable about these businesses than most other investors an important advantage for our shareholders baron asset has out performed the s  p  russell  and all but a few other funds since its inception baron funds owns major interests in several publicly traded photo businesses vail resorts sothebys manor care charles schwab american tower robert half heftel saga communications sun

in seven years of course we cannot predict future results baron a growth businessour investment performance has been very good our media coverage great our distribution extraordinary at its founding in  baron capital had less than  million customer assets under management our firm was dependent for revenue upon brokerage commissions paid by its institutional customers for our investment research we made the decision to stop selling our research to others seven years ago about six years ago our firms assets under management began to grow very rapidly since  baron capital has been one of the fastest growing domestic equity mutual funds in the united states the firms customer assets under management have grown to  billion as of december  the date of this letter each year for the past six years baron funds has garnered an increasing share of the assets invested in domestic equity mutual funds during the past two years baron funds has received more than  of net new assets invested in domestic equity mutual funds  our firms rapid customer asset growth has been achieved importantly because we recognized in  that charles schwabs mutual fund marketplace and later that schwabs mutual fund onesource would revolutionize mutual fund distribution baron funds has benefited greatly not just from its participation in schwabs onesource but also as a member in fidelitys fundsnetwork and other fund supermarket distribution systems the strong performance of baron asset fund since  and of our managed accounts for the seventeen years prior had already attracted the attention of the financial press the new financial supermarkets permitted independent fee based financial planners for the first time to easily invest for their clients in our by then already well known but still small mutual fund the very favorable publicity we have received in the financial press since has helped us add retail investors also through the convenience of the financial supermarkets baron asset fund has increasingly been chosen as one of several mutual funds to be offered as a possible k investment option for employees of large corporations our strategic alliances with other large mutual fund management companies and brokerage firms have also helped us begin to grow our k investors we believe  k plan investors will continue to increase their percentage ownership of our mutual funds this is of benefit to our funds other shareholders since these assets have greater persistency namely they last longer and accordingly allow us to continue to make longer term potentially very profitable investments in businesses baron has terrific employeestalented ethical hard working loyal not part of the prospectus pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th baron capital has

in securities of small and medium sized companies with undervalued assets or favorable growth prospects baron growth fund capital appreciation baron small cap fund capital appreciation through investments primarily in securities of small companies effective may   the shareholders of baron growth fund voted to change the investment goal and objective to capital appreciation dropping income as a secondary objective the board of trustees then changed the name of the fund to baron growth fund investment decisions are made by the funds investment adviser bamco inc the adviser baron asset fund and baron growth fund invest primarily in small sized companies with market capitalizations of approximately  million to  billion and medium sized companies with market values of  billion to  billion baron small cap fund invests at least  of its total assets measured at cost in the securities of smaller companies with market values of up to  billion and it can invest up to  in the securities of larger sized companies although baron funds invest primarily in small and medium sized companies the funds will not sell positions just because their market values have increased the funds will add to its positions in a company even though its market capitalization has increased through appreciation beyond the limits stated if in the advisers judgment the company is still an attractive investment the funds may invest in larger companies if the adviser perceives an attractive opportunity in a larger company what does the adviser look for in making investment decisions for the funds the adviser seeks securities that the adviser believes have o favorable price to value characteristics based on the advisers assessment of their prospects for future growth and profitability o the potential to increase in value at least  over two subsequent years prospectus  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the adviser thoroughly researches the companies in which the funds invest included in the research process are visits and interviews by the adviser with company managements and their major competitors the adviser looks for special business niches unusually favorable business opportunities the opportunity to benefit from long lasting economic trends barriers to entry strong management capabilities and strong balance sheets the funds may take large positions in the companies in which the adviser has the greatest conviction the funds have a long term outlook they are not shortterm traders of securities there is no assurance that the funds will meet their investment goals what kinds of securities do the funds buy the funds invest primarily in common stocks but may also invest in other equitytype securities such as convertible bonds and debentures preferred stocks warrants and convertible preferred stocks securities are selected for their capital appreciation potential and investment income is not a consideration the equity security portion of the portfolios consist primarily of common stocks and may include convertible securities preferred stocks warrants and convertible preferred stocks the debt security portion of the portfolios may include notes bonds debentures and money market instruments debt securities represent an obligation of the issuer to repay a loan of money to it often with interest the debt securities in which the funds may invest include rated and unrated securities and convertible instruments there is no minimum rating for the debt securities that may be purchased for those funds the funds rely on the advisers assessment of the issuers securities and do not use independent ratings organizations what are the principal risks of investing in the funds general stock market risk o the funds principal risks are those of investing in the stock market the value of your investment in a fund will increase as the stock market prices of the securities owned by the fund increase and will decrease as the funds investments decrease in market value equity securities fluctuate in value often based on factors unrelated to the value of the issuer such as political economic or general market conditions because the stock values fluctuate when you sell your investment you may receive more or less money than you originally invested  prospectus pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th small and medium sized companies o the adviser believes there is more potential for capital appreciation in smaller companies and in establishing significant positions in companies in which the adviser has the greatest conviction but there also may be more risk securities of smaller companies may not be well known to most investors and the securities may be thinly traded there is more reliance on the skills of a compa nys management and on their continued tenure investments may be attractively priced relative to the advisers assessment of a companys growth prospects management expertise and business niche yet have modest or no current cash flows or earnings although the adviser concentrates on a companys growth prospects it also focuses on cash flow asset value and reported earnings this investment approach requires a longterm outlook and may require shareholders to assume more risk and to have more patience than investing in the securities of larger more established companies debt securities o lower rated securities may have a higher yield and the potential for a greater return than investment grade securities but may also have more risk lower rated securities are generally meant for longerterm investing and may be subject to certain risks with respect to the issuing entity and to market fluctuations see the sai for more information the adviser will also evaluate the securities and the ability of the issuers to pay interest and principal with lower rated debt securities a funds ability to achieve its investment objective may be more dependent on the advisers credit analysis than might be the case with higher rated securities the market price and yield of lower rated securities are generally more volatile than those of higher rated securities factors adversely affecting the market price and yield of these securities will adversely affect the funds net asset value the trading market for these securities may be less liquid than that of higher rated securities companies that issue lower rated securities may be highly leveraged or may have unstable earnings and consequently the risk of the investment in the securities of such issuers may be greater than with higher rated securities the interest bearing features of debt securities carry a promise of income flow but the price of the securities are inversely affected by changes in interest rates and are therefore subject to the risk of market price fluctuations the market values of debt securities may also be affected by changes in the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuers convertible securities o since convertible securities combine the investment characteristics of both bonds and common stocks the funds convertible securities investments absorb the market risks of both stocks and bonds the combination does however make the investment less sensitive to interest rate changes than straight bonds of comparable maturity and quality and usually less volatile than common stocks because of these factors convertible securities are likely to perform differently than broadlybased measures of the stock and bond markets prospectus

the risk that prepayments on the underlying mortgages will cause the principal and interest on the mortgagebacked securities to be paid prior to their stated maturities mortgage prepayments are more likely to accelerate during periods of declining longterm interest rates if a prepayment occurs baron growth fund may have unanticipated proceeds which it may then have to invest at a lower interest rate and may be penalized by not having participated in a comparable security not subject to prepayment whenissued securities the funds may invest up to  of their respective assets in debt and equity securities purchased on a whenissued basis although the payment and interest terms of whenissued securities are established at the time the purchaser enters into the commitment the actual payment for and delivery of whenissued securities generally takes place within  days the fund bears the risk that interest rates on debt securities at the time of delivery may be higher or lower than those contracted for on the whenissued security failure of the issuer to deliver the security purchased on a whenissued basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment medium and lower rated corporate debt securities all of the funds may invest in debt securities baron growth fund and baron small cap fund may invest up to  of their respective total assets in securities that are rated in the medium to lowest rating categories by sp and moodys some of which may be known as junk bonds the funds will rely on the advisers judgment analysis and experience in evaluating debt securities the adviser believes that the difference between perceived risk and actual risk creates the opportunity for profit which can be realized through thorough analysis ratings by sp and moodys evaluate only the safety of principal and interest payments not market value risk because the creditworthiness of an issuer may change more rapidly than is able to be timely reflected in changes in credit ratings the adviser monitors the issuers of corporate debt securities held in the funds portfolio the credit ratings assigned by a rating agency to a security are not considered by the adviser in selecting a security the adviser examines the intrinsic value of a security in light of market conditions and the underlying fundamental values because of the nature of medium and lower rated corporate debt securities achievement by the funds of their respective investment objectives when investing in such securities is dependent on the credit analysis of the adviser the adviser could be wrong in its analysis if the funds purchased primarily higher rated debt securities risks would be substantially reduced a general economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates could severely disrupt the market for medium and lower grade corporate debt securities and adversely affect the market value of such securities the ability of issuers of medium and lower grade corporate debt securities to repay principal and to pay interest to meet projected business goals and to obtain additional financing may be adversely affected by economic conditions such consequences could lead to an increased incidence of default for such securities and adversely affect the value of the corporate debt securities in a  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th funds portfolio the secondary market prices of medium and lower grade corporate debt securities are more sensitive to adverse economic changes or individual corporate developments than are higher rated debt securities adverse publicity and investor perceptions whether or not based on rational analysis and periods of economic uncertainty may also affect the value and liquidity of medium and lower grade corporate debt securities although such factors also present investment opportunities when prices fall below intrinsic values yields on debt securities in the portfolio that are interest rate sensitive can be expected to fluctuate over time to the extent that there is no established market for some of the medium or low grade corporate debt securities in which the funds may invest there may be thin or no trading in such securities and the ability of the adviser to value accurately such securities may be adversely affected further it may be more difficult for a fund to sell securities for which no established retail market exists as compared with securities for which such a market does exist during periods of reduced market liquidity and in the absence of readily available market quotations for medium and lower grade corporate debt securities held in a funds portfolio the responsibility of the adviser to value that funds securities becomes more difficult and the advisers judgment may play a greater role in the valuation of the funds securities due to a reduced availability of reliable objective data to the extent that a fund purchases illiquid securities or securities which are restricted as to resale that fund may incur additional risks and costs illiquid and restricted securities may be particularly difficult to value and their disposition may require greater effort and expense than more liquid securities a fund may be required to incur costs in connection with the registration of restricted securities in order to dispose of such securities although under rule a under the securities act of  certain securities may be determined to be liquid pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees under applicable guidelines the funds may invest in securities of distressed issuers when the intrinsic values of such securities in the opinion of the adviser warrant such investment other debt securities the funds may invest in zerocoupon stepcoupon and payinkind securities these securities are debt securities that do not make regular interest payments zerocoupon and stepcoupon securities are sold at a deep discount to their face value payinkind securities pay interest through the issuance of additional securities the market value of these debt securities generally fluctuates in response to changes in interest rates to a greater degree than interestpaying securities of comparable term and quality the secondary market value of corporate debt securities structured as zero coupon securities or paymentinkind securities may be more volatile in response to changes in interest rates than debt securities which pay interest periodically in cash because such securities do not pay current interest but rather income is accrued to the extent that a fund does not have available cash to meet distribution requirements with respect to such income it could be required to dispose of portfolio securities that it otherwise would not such disposition could be at a disadvantageous price investment in such securities also involves certain tax considerations baron growth fund and baron small cap fund from time to time may also purchase indebtedness and participations therein both secured and unsecured of debtor companies in reorganization or financial restructuring such indebtedness may be in the form of loans notes bonds or debentures when the funds purchase a participation interest they assume the credit risk associated with the bank or other financial intermediary as well as the credit risk associated with the issuer of any underlying debt instrument the funds may also purchase trade and other claims against and other unsecured obligations of such debtor companies which generally represent money due a supplier of goods or services to such company some debt securities purchased by the funds may have very long maturities the length of time remaining until maturity is one factor the adviser considers in purchasing a particular indebtedness the purchase of indebtedness of a troubled company always involves a risk as to the creditworthiness of the issuer and the possibility that the investment may be lost the adviser believes  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st that the difference between perceived risk and actual risk creates the opportunity for profit which can be realized through thorough analysis there are no established markets for some of this indebtedness and it is less liquid than more heavily traded securities indebtedness of the debtor company to a bank are not securities of the banks issuing or selling them the funds may purchase loans from national and state chartered banks as well as foreign ones the funds may invest in senior indebtedness of the debtor companies although on occasion subordinated indebtedness may also be acquired the funds may also invest in distressed first mortgage obligations and other debt secured by real property the funds do not currently anticipate investing more than  of their respective assets in trade and other claims the funds may enter into repurchase agreements with certain banks or nonbank dealers in a repurchase agreement the fund buys a security at one price and at the time of sale the seller agrees to repurchase that security at a mutually agreed upon time and price repurchase agreements could involve certain risks in the event of the failure of the seller to repurchase the securities as agreed which may cause a fund to suffer a loss including loss of interest on or principal of the security and costs associated with delay and enforcement of the repurchase agreement repurchase agreements with a duration of more than seven days are considered illiquid securities as a form of borrowing baron growth fund and baron small cap fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements with certain banks or nonbank dealers where the fund sells a security and simultaneously agrees to buy it back later at a mutually agreed upon price to the extent a fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements it will maintain a segregated account consisting of liquid assets or highly marketable securities to cover its obligations reverse repurchase agreements may expose the fund to greater fluctuations in the value of its assets options transactions and swaps  baron asset fund may write sell covered call options or purchase put options on equity andor debt securities baron growth fund and baron small cap fund may write sell put and covered call options and purchase put and call options on equity andor debt securities the funds may also enter into equity swap transactions all calls sold by the funds must be covered ie a fund must own the underlying securities or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes that fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation when exercised to buy the underlying security at the exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller if exercised the obligation to sell the underlying security at the exercise price an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during a fixed period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period

derivative investments exchangelisted options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying security through the process of exercising the option listed options are usually closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option the funds ability to close out its position as a  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchangelisted options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option are negotiated by the parties the funds expect generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although they are not required to do so equity swap transactions are entered into with financial institutions through a direct agreement with the counterparty generally an isda master agreement the specific terms of which are negotiated by the parties the funds may use equity swaps or other derivative instruments for hedging purposes against potential adverse movements in security prices or for nonhedging purposes such as seeking to enhance return the funds may be required to post collateral for such transactions unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option or derivatives including swaps as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security or other instrument or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in according with the option the fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction the adviser must assess the creditworthiness of each counterparty to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option or the derivative will be satisfied the funds will engage in otc option transactions and derivatives only with previously approved counterparties the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of the funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitations on investments in illiquid securities use of segregated and other special accounts  many hedging transactions in addition to other requirements require that a fund segregate liquid high grade assets with its custodian

securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities or instruments required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid high grade securities at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by a fund will require that fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed

obligations of the trust the declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the fund or any series thereof notice of such disclaimer will normally be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the funds or trustees the declaration of trust provides for indemnification by a fund for any loss suffered by a shareholder as a result of an obligation of that fund the declaration of trust also provides that a fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for an act or obligation of that fund and satisfy any judgement thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account or shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the fund itself would be unable to meets its obligations the trustees believe that in view of the above the risk of personal liability of shareholders is remote the declaration of trust further provides that the trustees will not be liable for errors of judgement or mistakes of fact or law but nothing in the declaration of trust protects a trustee against liability to which he or she would otherwise be
