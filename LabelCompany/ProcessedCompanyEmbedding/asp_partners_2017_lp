busy trying to weather the storm of the last two years weve positioned ourselves for the demand phase of the cycle and are set to benefit from the demand increases that are coming for us hydrocarbons it felt good to see the word record in our press release and with production coming back and a number of our own long lead time projects coming online we hope to be using that word more total gross operating margin was  billion up  from first quarter of last year ebitda was a record  billion and our distributable cash flow was up  with a coverage ratio of  three of our four business segments reported higher gross operating margins than the same quarter last year we had record ngl pipeline transportation volumes record marine terminal volumes and record onshore liquids pipeline transportation volumes of  million barrels a day our biggest demand project our pdh remains on target to be up and running in the third quarter permitting and engineering is moving along for our ibdh plant which is expected to be up in the second half of  both of these projects are similar as the movement towards increased ethane cracking that brought us numerous feedstock opportunities is now giving us the opportunity to take growing lpg volumes and turn them into higher value propylene and butylene in april we announced that well develop ethylene storage and transportation in and around our us gulf coast assets because we are already connected to every ethylene plant in the us and supply them with substantial amounts of their ethane and propane as well as their storage needs we feel like we can add value to these customers storing and transporting their ethylene we expect that to be online in  as to supply projects in the permian we recently announced a major ngl pipeline our chinook pipeline the pipeline will have an initial capacity of  barrels a day but its expandable to  barrels a day we expect that in service in the first half of  this pipe adds to our other westtoeast ngl pipelines in moving ngls to our fractionation storage distribution and export systems at mont belvieu we recently added two new processing plants in the permian and have a third our orla plant under construction and frankly we expect to add more processing in that basin as our forecast indicated that additional gas processing will be needed we have plant   under construction in order to support all of these liquids which is expected to be up and running in the first half of next year our midlandtosealy crude pipeline is currently under construction with an expected inservice date late this year ramping up to full capacity early next year there are two areas that have been seen as laggards over the last couple of years the eagle ford and the haynesville starting with the haynesville over the last  to  months there have been significant ma activity the buyers are applying new drilling and completion techniques have very low breakevens and are experiencing significantly improved initial production rates and reserves and they are committed to the basin and are moving quickly to maximize their returns after bottoming at  rigs last year haynesville rig counts have improved considerably to around  and there were over  wells drilled in the play in the first quarter with parties like covey park considering ipo it appears that capital markets understand the capabilities of these new producers and the capabilities of the haynesville with this increased level of activity volumes in our gathering systems are increasing rapidly in fact by yearend we project that our state line system in north louisiana could exceed our peak volumes of a half of  bcf set back in  this outlook was a key driver behind our recent acquisition of the azure gathering and processing assets these assets access both rich and lean haynesville and cotton valley production and are an excellent fit with our systems in east texas and louisiana in addition these assets complement our supply footprint and will help us grow our gulf coast markets we feel good about what we have seen from this new type of haynesville producer and we like where the production sits relative to growing demand in the eagle ford similar to what we have seen in the haynesville eagle ford acreage is now beginning to turn over in a trend that is expected to continue the highest profile resale was anadarkos sale to sanchez but there have been others including pioneer selling some of their atascosa county acreage and acreage sales by newfield sm and rosetta obviously the cost of entry is much lower in the eagle ford than the permian and the basin has technical upside both in new drilling and completion techniques and in the spec phase now being developed in the upper eagle ford austin chalk and the buda after hitting the low of  rigs last october the eagle ford rig count has moved up to around  with  wells permitted and  horizontal wells drilled during the first quarter while rig count increases – instantaneously bring incremental volumes we project that eagle ford production is now stabilizing and will soon begin to grow as eagle ford production grows we have the capacity in our existing assets so increased production means cash flow upside and from a competitive standpoint our enterprise value chain is hard to match we also believe there isnt a better basin situated for the growth in the crude ngl and gas markets including exports finally we think its important that the market appreciates the ability of the houston ship channel to handle the growth in energy exports that we expect to occur over the next  to  years with our facilities at our enterprise hydrocarbons terminal and at morgans point there isnt a company that has more experience and more conviction around the capabilities of the houston ship channel than enterprise over the years weve become used to rhetoric from competitors trying to get a toehold into exports but recently the houston ship channel has been the recipient of deceptive allegations from folks promoting other texas ports frankly because they dont have and cant get a position on the ship channel ive read commentary from socalled experts many of whom have never loaded a ship about growing congestion on the houston ship channel people are entitled to their own opinions they are not entitled to their own facts here are the facts actual ship traffic data shows that the houston ship channel operates at well under  of its peak day capacity nothing compares to the ship channels capabilities nowhere has the combination of over  pilots designated barge lanes twoway traffic a draft of  feet max beam of  feet air draft of  feet and probably most important somewhere in the neighborhood of  berths the ability to stage a lot of vessels at multiple docks is what really allows ship traffic to move in and out smoothly theres a reason the houston area is considered the energy capital of the world one reason is the houston ship channel another reason is refining capacity that offers producers a domestic market of  million barrels a day of crude and more storage than all other gulf coast locations combined all of these gives producers the two things they value the most full assurance and market choices and with that ill turn it over to bryan bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp thank you jim and good morning everyone i will discuss a few income statement items for the first quarter provide an update on our growth and sustained capital spending for  and wrap up with an overview of our balance sheet metrics and capital raising activities for the quarter but before doing so id like to reiterate comments ive made in the past regarding revenue and seasonality the changes in revenue and operating costs and expenses are largely influenced by changes in commodity prices and are not typically an accurate depiction of the partnerships performance in contrast to the past few quarters the first quarter of  revenue was up  when compared to the same quarter of  while associated costs and expenses were up  we believe total gross operating margin is a better performancebased metric and as jim mentioned it increased  to  billion for the first quarter of  when compared with the first quarter of  also its important to be reminded that the fourth and first quarters are typically our seasonally stronger financial performance quarters now moving along to income items for the quarter net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter of  was  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of  it was a relatively clean quarter with no material nonrecurring items total capital spending in the first quarter of  was  million including  million for sustaining capital expenditures for the full year of  we expect organic growth capital expenditures to be approximately  billion to  billion and sustaining capital expenditures to come in right around  million this is slightly elevated from the levels provided during the analyst day given the number of new organic projects weve announced and were mentioned earlier in jims comments in addition we recently closed the previously announced  million acquisition of the midstream assets – midstream business and assets of azure midstream partners through a bankruptcydirected auction process at march   our total debt principal outstanding was  billion the average life of our debt portfolio was  years and our effective average cost of debt was  adjusted ebitda for the  months ended march   was  billion and our consolidated leverage ratio continues to trend lower after peaking near  times in third quarter  for the first quarter of  it was  times after adjusting debt for the  equity treatment ascribed by the rating agencies for the hybrid debt securities and we reduce it further for cash and cash equivalents further when we adjust debt for elevated working capital levels associated with shortterm continuing opportunities across commodities and contracted growth projects under construction our adjusted leverage ratio was just under  and  times respectively for the first quarter of  we retained  million of distributable cash flow and raised  million in net equity proceeds from our distribution reinvestment program our employee unit purchase program and the aftermarket or atm program to that end we had record unaffiliated unitholder participation in our distribution reinvestment program that was paid in february which raised  million in equity proceeds finally our consolidated liquidity was approximately  billion at march   which included available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash with that ill turn the call back over to randy john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you bryan nicole were ready to take questions from our participants but before we do that let me remind everyone that wed like to limit the questions to one question plus one followup please to give more people time to ask questions go ahead nicole questionandanswer session operator certainly it is now time for the questionandanswer session your first question comes from the line of jean ann salisbury with bernstein jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi good morning i just wanted to see if you could give a little more color on how to think about the competitive positioning of your oil gas and ngl pipelines in the permian youve mentioned before that your crude acreage dedication could be a primary feeder to your oil pipeline would those be the same customers on your other pipelines or is it just a totally different set that youre pitching a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think its a mix some of the customers will be the same but there will be others that will be different jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay so the acreage dedications support the crude pipeline but not necessarily the other pipeline a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thats correct they would be individual per pipeline jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay thanks and separately i get a lot of questions about whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the permian i think youve said before that you dont expect that due to the no permitting and quick build time for the plant but i just wanted to get your latest view on that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp im sorry i missed your question you said what now jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the permian anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp not if we have anything to do with it a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thats correct jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brandon blossman with tudor tuckering sic pickering holt  co brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning everyone a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning brandon brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc lets see ill circle back on the ngl pipeline what just broadly from a macro perspective what are you guys seeing in terms of takeaway capacity over the next five years for ngls out of the permian and are you thinking – how do you think about market share gains relative to your competitors over that fiveyear period for ngl takeaway in the basin anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp brandon this is tony when we made our announcement on our ngl pipeline we said it was expandable and as we see the numbers at current drilling rates that we think theres a good chance that over the time period that you discussed that we will be expanding it thats how we see it brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay fair enough related topic the texas interstate system – natural gas system – saw a downtick yearoveryear whats and probably for tony whats the trajectory there from your expectations going forward bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp hi this is brad i think that from a trajectory perspective we – kind of seen the bottom and i suspect that well start to see some upside on a goforward basis as we maximize the use of the pipes out of the permian going east and south and then with the pickup of the eagle ford we should see some revenue growth there as well brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thats my two ill circle back thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of tj schultz with rbc capital markets tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc great thanks good morning i guess just first if you can give any update on centennial just discussions with customers on needs for diversification and how much that may ultimately play into the dynamic i guess just to find a second market for ngls a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well the centennial project is a slow play right now these projects require a multitude of players to be involved they have fast phases and slow phases and were in slow phase weve suspended work in the field were pressing on with our negotiations with shippers northeast producers that want additional access to the gulf coast market for their propane and were calling on other people to see if they would be interested to be shippers and when theres sufficient volume demand therell be a project i think were a long way from talking about abandonment but until theres a volume at acceptable levels to justify a project it wont go forward but the good news i think in that is that because of the acceptable range of volumes that would justify the high end of that is very realistic it should be just a matter of timing but until its there until the demands there theres no project in a nutshell tj were not going to chase it if people want it well do it but were not going to chase it tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay that makes sense i guess second would just be on the eagle ford and haynesville you spent some time there so you see leases turning over you just bought the azure assets i guess are there other assets in those particular basins that you think make sense potentially from an ma perspective or is azure kind of a oneoff and the message is just that more that theres open capacity right now in your system that youll participate in with minimal capex a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think azure was a unique situation that fit us like a glove and i think that the eagle ford wed like to see production come back more tony thinks it will weve got plenty of capacity to handle it without doing a heck of a lot in the permian we found that its more economical to build than to get caught up in the frenzy of paying high premiums for existing assets tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay great thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of kristina kazarian with deutsche bank kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc good morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc jim you started off talking about the multiyear period of petchem demand growth that were going into and i know you guys announced a handful of new projects in the quarter but maybe could you talk high level about like what the next set of major infrastructure needs or projects epd is kind of focused on to meet these needs and i guess most importantly how big could this opportunity be a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well with pdh and ibdh its pretty big already kristina but from an ethylene perspective i think what rb and his groups putting together is kind of sticking your toe in the water to see where we can go with ethylene logistics i think putting together a storage system that the entire gulf coast can use putting together a distribution system is a first step now we rb has worked tirelessly on ethylene export but the question there is how long is this market how long is it with ethylene for how long and well keep working that and see where it goes but right now we just kind of like what were doing just a minute im getting a note and then tonys reminding me that he thinks that theres a second wave of crackers that will be built in the us he doesnt think were through building crackers which will be supportive of us putting together kind of an ethylene hub and distribution center and will be supportive of our ethylene delivery infrastructure kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect so i guess my followup will be maybe just timeframe on those latter two points so timeframe to developing a lot of the infrastructure needed to handling the end products on the ethylene side and maybe timeframe to tonys second wave of crackers that maybe might be coming anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp this is tony so relative to the second wave were watching the announcements quasiannouncements like everyone else so lets think in the early s thats what we expect and then relative to hub activities rb will take it roger b herrscher  enterprise products partners lp yeah were currently developing the pipeline transportation and the storage if the ethylene terminal goes if the demand is there it will go but a lot of the crackers focus a lot on their feedstock supply and their derivative capacity and what we have found is theres a little bit of a gap there on the ethylene side of the business that were trying to fill their needs kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect guys hope you win all of them thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of darren horowitz with raymond james darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc good morning guys jim maybe a question for you or tony id like your thoughts on the expectations that propane balances possibly could meaningfully tighten this winter and what you think about the impact on market dynamics and pricing specifically if we dont have enough us supply to meet lpg exports running at  barrels or  barrels a day without drawing down inventories how do you guys think about capitalizing on what could be a very profitable arbitrage of securing propane nearterm storing it at belvieu selling it forward especially if were heading into a scenario where mont belvieu propane could sell at a premium to like northwest europe a james teague  enterprise products partners lp hey darren i wondered where you were darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc i did too jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp and you didnt start out with saying nice quarter have you been hanging out with our ngl marketing guys darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc as much as i can a james teague  enterprise products partners lp now youre speaking of contango obviously and we did quite a lot of contango last year tuck  we havent done – frankly we havent had the opportunity to do as much i dont think the first quarter as we did last year but it is in our playbook and the beauty of our system is when you have things like weve had the last couple of years invariably it creates other opportunities that arent otherwise there contango being one of them and weve got a system that can capitalize on that big time brent tuck  anything brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp well i think youre deadon this is brent talking the market has not told propane that it needs to be stored yet and so youre starting to see some stuff happen youre starting to see just from the industry talk cancellations happen this month and yeah for the month of may but ultimately i think youre spoton the market will tell propane that it needs to be stored so that they can get geared up for this winter darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc hey jim by the way good quarter thats all i had thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of matthew phillips with guggenheim partners matthew phillips  guggenheim securities good morning guys so continuing on the petchem theme tony alluded to it before but exxon recently announced the possibility of a new cracker down near corpus christi you all have a frac in nueces county i mean do you – that part of texas is fairly light in ngl infrastructure i mean do you see the room for more of a buildup there whether its your own assets or acquiring thirdparty assets a james teague  enterprise products partners lp if they build that monster were certainly going to be in there pitching a system to supply it if you look at – we say it a lot for ngls were tied to every ethylene plant in the united states were very proud of that and were not going to let an ethylene plant come online that we dont have some kind of access to matthew phillips  guggenheim securities would it make more sense to extend aegis that way or would you build a bespoke frac for a plant like that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well the reality is we – from mont belvieu down to south texas we have a inch pipeline in ethane service thats bidirectional so we call aegis from mont belvieu to the river the reality is weve got an ethane header from corpus to the mississippi river so were positioned to do some but if they build what they say theyre going to build what is it tony over  barrels i think anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp over  barrels a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp theyre going to need an infrastructure i bet were talking to them out there matthew phillips  guggenheim securities to that point i mean the fact that exxon and sabic would build a plant of that size does that kind of throw some cold water on the idea that were going to be tight ethane anytime in the next five six seven years a james teague  enterprise products partners lp personally ill let tony weigh in but as i look at all the associated gas and rich gas im having a hard time thinking were going to run out of ethane anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes our balances for ethane and we published them at the analyst meeting changed considerably over the last year so we have a slide we published it in our investor materials all the time as to how we see it and its – the situation is much better than it was before and out of the shales ethane is plentiful and getting more plentiful all of the time matthew phillips  guggenheim securities you mean much better from a supply perspective anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes yes matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp thats correct matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay got it thank you anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp matt i guess i want to add one other thing jim alluded to infrastructure when we look at the second wave of crackers they need services that particularly around storage and transportation that are offered in and out of mont belvieu so i personally dont believe that youre going to disconnect mont belvieu from anything that happens further south just like you didnt disconnect it from whats happening in louisiana matthew phillips  guggenheim securities does it make sense for you to – would it dilute your turns to build a frac further south than i would at mont belvieu at this point a james teague  enterprise products partners lp no matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay thank you operator your next question comes from ted durbin with goldman sachs theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co thanks just coming back to the permian and the gas takeaway question i guess can you quantify how much gas youre moving or can you move right now on the texas intrastates is it because youve got a lot of capacity on that system but its hard to know exactly how much can come up right now before you get your new gas line built a james teague  enterprise products partners lp brad bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp yeah we can move – weve got the two pipes the inch and the inch we can move over  bcf a day away from the area as it sits today what i can tell you is on a daily basis we run fairly full already because weve seen the volume start to show up so theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful thanks and then second question is when you think about whether its a permian gas pipe or an ngl pipe this mandate to use american steel i think you mentioned that you always use american steel but im just curious about your thoughts on the costs as they kind of come through the industry how that might impact your ability to pass on if there are higher costs and earn the returns on capital that you want to earn a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were going to adjust the kind of deals we do based on what our costs are the one thing is we – the fact that weve had a real initiative to build kevin  for the last eight ten years that we were going to buy american weve developed pretty good relationships with the mills and we think that gives us an advantage kevin  youve got anything to add i mean yeah more demand probably increases costs but american capitalism is pretty neat it has a way of making it up unknown speaker yeah weve been successful so far we havent had the big you know price problems and as you know weve bought american on virtually all our major projects for some time theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay ill leave it at that thank you a james teague  enterprise products partners lp weve got an american flag in here in the conference room you know operator your next question comes from the line of shneur gershuni with ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hi good morning guys a lot of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just a quick followup i think kristina asked earlier about potential project opportunities and so forth you know excluding the gas pipeline that youre thinking about out of waha is there kind of a number that were thinking about in terms of how big the backlog could potentially get to are we talking  billion to  billion more are we talking something on the scale of  billion to  billion im just wondering if you can sort of give us a frame of reference a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well i think our biggest problem is holding our people back we never talk about our backlog we dont publish that at all weve got this many billions of dollars of backlog but we seem to always – if we think were going to spend a  billion two years from now when we get there its usually a lot more shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc i mean is there kind of like a capacity that you feel that you can handle on an annual basis  billion to  billion is kind of your max capacity that your staff can handle or do you think that you can do something bigger than that bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp this is bryan weve had in the past weve handled quite handily  billion to  billion without thirdparty acquisitions and i think with our size and the access to capital markets to the extent theres opportunity there we dont really see it as being a huge limiting factor of course well always instill the discipline that weve demonstrated over the years with respect to our balance sheet and approach in dcf coverage shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc very helpful and then just in terms of financing and equity needs and so forth youve had a pretty decent quarter – or pretty good quarter actually – in terms of ebitda and dcf and so forth does this take down your equity needs for this year youve talked about being selffunding in  has that timeframe moved at all either up or backwards just given the changes to your capex forecast bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp well just on your latter notion with respect to yes being selffunded is dependent upon a recovery and of course were on that the winds not quite fully at our back at this point but we are continuing to spend and find the opportunities so the more opportunities we find the less likely well be fully selffunded but our equity needs still as we look forward into  remain light and as far as this year pretty much the last three quarters are a pretty good indication of the range of activity that we might have with respect to raising thirdparty equity shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc perfect thank you very much guys really appreciate the color operator your next question comes from the line of brian zarahn with mizuho brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc on the chinook  project you secured customer contracts from a high level how do you view producer willingness to sign contracts for existing projects and potential future projects a james teague  enterprise products partners lp if you look at that pipeline the most reliable supply that you can have for a pipeline is that that comes out of your own plants which should tell you something about our plans in the delaware permian from a processing perspective brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc understood i guess maybe trying to extend throughout your other projects how do you view the producer willingness to increase their contracted capacity so for example midlandtosealy a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah midlandtosealy i think were going to be fine we originally said that pipeline was going to come on at  barrels a day we have opted to take it up to its full  barrel a day capacity we did that because we feel like  barrels well be at easily and theres room to grow were talking to a lot of folks theres a lot of interest i think a lot of the reason theres interest it isnt just that they are signing up for a pipeline theyre signing up for a system that gets them to the water on the houston ship channel that gets them to a market that has  million barrels a day of refining capacity and gets them to a location that has tons of storage so what theyre looking at i think is this is ideal for giving me the flow assurance that i want and the ability to market my crude to a variety of customers brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc along those lines on crude exports weve seen significant growth this year and assuming the eia data is correct exceeding over  million barrels a day at times how do you view the crude export opportunity given the current spread environment and do you have enough capacity in the future to accommodate expected permian production growth to load vessels a james teague  enterprise products partners lp go ahead bob  laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp i feel like we have plenty of capacity to handle it and ill let brent speak to our future potential for crude exports a james teague  enterprise products partners lp how much crude could we load today without spending a dime laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp four million barrels a day brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp yeah four million barrels a day across all the terminals and that can be increased for minimal dollar impact a james teague  enterprise products partners lp on the our  piece for a while last year we had structural working for us and so we were doing quite a few exports just based on structure not based on brent wti spreads but as structures come in youre seeing these spreads widen youre seeing it widen all the way down the curve our belief much like we said at the analyst meeting is that these barrels have to clear on the water theres only so much demand here domestically for this light sweet crude it is the cheapest barrel thats going to be out there for the global market and ultimately this barrel its not justified to be stored so wheres the next move it goes out by the water brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy tonet with jpmorgan jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good morning a james teague  enterprise products partners lp hey jeremy jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc just wanted to touch on waha basis youve talked about this a bit here but just wondering if you could walk me through how to think about what stops that basis from widening out at this point youve really seen it move and just what can you guys do to capitalize on that in the near term i guess a james teague  enterprise products partners lp brent brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp waha basis a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yes brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp hes talking gas a james teague  enterprise products partners lp oh gas brad bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp weve got a little bit left i guess id say in the near term as far as this basis or pipeline capacity to take advantage of the basis but for the most part we have sold that capacity on a firm basis away so its – a lot of the daytoday business that we do is not basisoriented between waha and south texas a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think one of the things we can do to take advantage of it is and others are trying is they are given present an opportunity to have more infrastructure out of there jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc so does the basis just anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes this is – jeremy this is tony when you look at the forward markets on basis for the waha area the markets already telling you capacity is tight and going to get tighter infrastructure is required to solve this problem jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks and then just one followup youve talked about in the past just wondered if you had any updated thoughts to share with regards to any potential in the future to adopt a dual c corp currency to kind of broaden investor access to enterprise bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp yeah jeremy thats something that well continue to evaluate it but really no update jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks thats it from me operator your next question comes from the line of faisel khan with citigroup faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc good morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning faisel faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc i had two questions but then you threw out this  million barreladay crude oil export number i just want to clarify that is that just crude oil or is that – youre talking about total liquids where its products and crude oil and condensate i mean my understanding is you have to have segregated tanks youve got to sort of – you cant just – theyre not  interchangeable i just want to make sure i understood your comment on the  million a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i would tell you the  million barrel a day does relate to all the commodities you referenced but as far as you dont necessarily have to have completely segregated tanks if you have the ability to completely drain a tank to load a ship so its a clean tank for the next product and that is across the system in that regard it does not include refrigerated products in that number faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc right but if youre already exporting sort of – the us exporting  million barrels a day of total liquids products i mean its displacement right you cant just like – if the product was in there to be exported then you would have the excess capacity for crude but you have to actually have both right a james teague  enterprise products partners lp his number doesnt have anything to do with lpg if thats what youre asking about faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc sure no but for the products right we export what the extra two three million barrels a day of product so im just trying to figure out how much excess capacity you have to move crude i guess thats the – yeah thats the more critical number as we grow production and keep product exports growing too right anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp faisal this is tony from a fundamental standpoint youre either going to export more crude or more refined product not both right and the behavior of the refineries isnt that theyre going to massively expand so if we look at that capacity and say whats the guess if you will as to whether or not its going to export crude or refined products because it wont be both we think that crude oil exports are the one that are the game just because the refineries arent adding all over the united states we just dont see that faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc okay sure no okay thats fair enough and last question just on the midlandtosealy pipeline going back to your comments so do you have the – i think at the analyst day you commented that you didnt have the  barrels a day of contracts in hand but that you were sort of very close to sort of inking those deals has that been done yet laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp yes we – well we have the  barrels a day filled of capacity and we actually think that well be at the  barrels a day capacity upon startup faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc sure i mean my question was on the contracts though are the contracts at capacity laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp yes a james teague  enterprise products partners lp what shes saying is weve got laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp were up to  barrels a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc okay okay got it okay makes sense okay thats it for me guys thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of michael bushi with tiaa  unknown speaker hi good morning gentlemen great quarter i wanted to talk about the capex number that was up a little bit from the analyst day is that  capex getting pulled forward or do you see new opportunities and following up do you expect if it is getting pulled forward from  to replace that in  thanks bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp michael  this is bryan that is not pulling  forward that is just the addition of the projects that have been added that has moved the  number up so also clearly we didnt talk about  but our  number has also moved up unknown speaker great great bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp yeah unknown speaker thats very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of barrett blaschke with mufg securities barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc hey guys just wanted to followup on the commentary about a second round of cracker buildup kind of timeline for that and do you see it as all being gulf coast or do you see the east coast finally trying to develop more of a local market around the volumes that are being produced up there anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp this is tony so we see the timeline as early s and as we look at the projects for now we see it as all being gulf coast barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc so no thoughts on – i guess that all tries to remain an export market as it builds out anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp up in the northeast barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc yes anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes sir thats how we see it barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc okay thank you anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris sighinolfi with jefferies christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc hey good morning jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc appreciate the comments about the many attributes of the ship channel i was intrigued by the conversation earlier on the call about export capacity so i just wanted to try and clarify that  million barrel a day number that you quoted im just trying to reference that relative to lets say what the q volume was so if i just think crude and refined products somewhere in the neighborhood of  million barrels a day is that the right sort of starting reference point to think about your headroom without meaningful capital spend a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yes thats probably in the ballpark yes christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay okay and then second just – or as a quick followup the number that you quoted for crude export last night or i guess this morning  –  barrels a day was just slightly different than the number that i saw in the release in april so i was just wondering if it was just a difference in definition or if i misinterpreted something or any help in clarifying that would be helpful john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp yes this is randy the press release that we put out in march was reflecting gross barrels and then what we referred to in the press release thats more our economic barrels or net our netted christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay okay perfect perfect and a final just followup on exports jim your comments in the release you had talked about morgans point ramping to sort of  barrel a day level by sort of the end of the year just curious i know your slide presentation had sort of indicated around that range as an average for  but you had mentioned in those presentation slides the opportunity of shippers to sort of flex around customer elections might change im just curious if im reading just way too much into your comment and nothings changed or if there were any maybe changes in the election a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think youre probably reading a little much into it christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay im at risk of doing that at times so thats fair all right thanks a lot guys appreciate it john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp nicole this is randy i think we have time for one more question operator okay and your final question comes from the line of john edwards with credit suisse john edwards  credit suisse good morning guys thanks for taking my question just on the second wave of steam crackers in terms of size i guess this first wave was around  barrels give or take of incremental ethane demand so maybe tony you can tell us whats – how big you see that second wave in terms of ethane demand a james teague  enterprise products partners lp john this is jim and ill turn over to tony you know theres a basic assumption that is the gas to crude spread so if youre assuming second wave youre assuming a wide gas to crude spread which frankly we do but that can – you have crude fall relative to gas so thats a different ballgame but we think it wont so tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp right yes so we have been on the bandwagon that the us has ample natural gas for a considerable time but relative to the question the projects that we are monitoring today have call it between  to  barrels of incremental demand those are the handful that were monitoring today as im going to call them prospects okay john edwards  credit suisse okay a james teague  enterprise products partners lp and that would include exxon sabic tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes sir it would john edwards  credit suisse okay now does that include shells cracker in the northeast or no anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp those are the existing wave those are being built theyre under construction this is the second wave john edwards  credit suisse okay all right fair enough and then just i guess for my second question jim you made the comment better to build than buy in the permian so you know i just thought maybe you could give us a little more insight into the permian opportunity i mean obviously youve talked about some of these with the – your midlandtosealy pipelines are you think is going to hit  barrels per day by the third quarter obviously very bullish there so any other comments you can make around opportunities that youre seeing in the permian and how enterprise can take advantage a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were building a truck line upstream of midland what is that laurie how long is that pipe that youre building up the loving county laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp from loving county into midland about  miles  miles  miles a james teague  enterprise products partners lp all right so we are building upstream of midland were being very disciplined and im – i mean heck i dont know were pretty sold on the place were pretty proud of our position i really dont know how to answer the question other than we continue to build out there in both crude gas and ngls john edwards  credit suisse okay fair enough thank you john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you nicole if you would give

executive officer “combined with the benefit of our recently acquired sampson plant and dong energy offtake contract we are right on track year over year with the expected fourth quarter lift from the wilmington terminal acquisition we are pleased to increase our  distribution guidance to at least  per unit” financial results for the first quarter of  we generated net revenue of  million an increase of  percent or  million from the corresponding quarter of  included in net revenue was product sales of  million on volume of  metric tons of wood pellets representing an increase of  million

were driven by increased product sales due to the sampson dropdown and a favorable customer and shipping contract mix adjusted gross margin per metric ton was  for the first quarter of  as compared to

our sponsor and affiliates of john hancock life insurance company for total consideration of  million comprised of two payments as described below wilmington owns a fully operational deepwater marine terminal in wilmington north carolina the “wilmington terminal” that we expect to generate approximately  million in incremental adjusted ebitda when it reaches its currently contracted runrate the acquisition of wilmington the “wilmington dropdown” is expected to close on or about october   subject to customary closing conditions the wilmington terminal is capable of receiving product by rail and truck storing up to  metric tons of wood pellets and loading up to panamaxsized vessels wilmington is party to longterm terminal services agreements to receive store and load a total of approximately  million metric tons per year “mtpy” of wood pellets from the partnership’s production plant in sampson county north carolina the “sampson plant” and a thirdparty production plant for our sponsor subject to deficiency payments if minimum throughput requirements are not met the wilmington terminal utilizes stateoftheart handling equipment and storage infrastructure designed to

acquisition of wilmington we initially expect to generate incremental adjusted ebitda of approximately  million for  and runrate incremental adjusted ebitda of approximately  million in  the partnership expects to fund the initial purchase price with borrowings under its revolving credit facility in addition wilmington is party to a longterm terminal services agreement with the hancock jv to receive store and load wood pellets from the hancock jv’s planned production plant in hamlet north carolina the “hamlet plant” wilmington’s terminal services agreement for production from the hamlet plant is also subject to deficiency payments if minimum throughput requirements are not met our sponsor is completing the detailed design of the fullyfinanced hamlet plant and has commenced site work and equipment procurement with full construction of the buildandcopy replica of the sampson plant expected to begin later this year and completion anticipated for late  production from the hamlet plant is expected to supply mgt power’s teesside renewable energy plant which is currently under construction in the united kingdom upon first deliveries to the wilmington terminal from the

income to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million the partnership expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures of  million and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of  million in  as a result the partnership expects fullyear distributable cash flow to be in the range of

our customers are generally ratable over the year the partnership’s quarterly income and cash flow are subject to the mix of customer shipments made which may vary from period to period as such the board of directors of the partnership’s general partner evaluates the partnership’s distribution coverage ratio on an annual basis when determining the distribution for a quarter market and contracting update our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the partnership our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of offtake contracts that has a weightedaverage

decarbonization in europe the united kingdom the “uk” recently completed a full hour period without burning coal to generate electricity a major milestone in its efforts to displace coalfired generation in addition the uk department of business energy and industrial strategy the “beis” completed a study that confirmed wood fiber sourced using practices employed in the southeast united states is a lowcarbon sustainable source of energy after agreeing last year to extend the uk government’s powers to award new contract for difference cfd incentives for lowcarbon energy projects out to  the beis is now considering the potential implications of the study on future policy decisions and cfd awards the japanese government recently reconfirmed the targeted power source mix for  the program includes  to  gigawatts of biomassfired capacity which represents demand for  to  million mtpy of biomass additional biomassfired power projects have been announced including kansai electric power’s potential conversion of its aioi power plant to wood pellets under a joint venture with mitsubishi corporation power and chubu electric’s plan to build a new cofired unit with capacity of approximately  gigawatt at its taketoyo power facility driven by consumer preference several multinational corporations have announced specific commitments to significantly reduce carbon emissions and increase adoption of renewable energy across their operations and supply chains biomassfired generation for the power and thermal needs of these operations is a reliable complement to intermittent wind and solar power we remain in active discussions with customers in europe and asia for longterm offtake contracts for the supply of wood pellets to be fulfilled directly by the partnership and by new capacity under development by our sponsor throughout the southeast united states including at its sites in lucedale mississippi and abbeville alabama as well as other sites positioned to take advantage of the existing terminal capacity at the chesapeake and wilmington terminals in addition our sponsor continues to evaluate its option to build and operate a marine export terminal at the port of pascagoula mississippi which could support wood pellet production from a potential production plant in lucedale mississippi and other potential facilities in the region conference call we will host a conference call with executive management related to our firstquarter  results and to discuss the agreement to purchase wilmington our outlook and guidance and a more detailed market update at

provided because gaap net income generated by the wilmington terminal is not available without unreasonable effort in part because the amount of estimated incremental interest expense related to the financing of the additional payment due upon first deliveries from the hamlet plant is not available at this time      nongaap financial measures we use adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenuegenerating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense early retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts we use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cashgenerating performance of the partnership from period to period and to compare the cashgenerating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions if any that are expected to be paid to our unitholders we do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with gaap we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations our nongaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measures you should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our definitions of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing their utility the following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted gross

nyse smlp announced today its financial and operating results for the three months ended march    smlp reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  compared to a net loss of  million for the prioryear period  net cash provided by operations totaled  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the prioryear period  adjusted ebitda totaled  million and distributable cash flow totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million and  million respectively for the prioryear period  natural gas volume throughput averaged  million cubic feet per day mmcfd in the

volume throughput metrics exclude its proportionate share of volume throughput from its  ownership interest in ohio gathering steve newby president and chief executive officer commented smlps first quarter  financial and operating results correspond with our expectations and full year  financial guidance  over the last several months drilling activity has increased significantly across our systems  we expect volume growth from this drilling activity to positively impact our operating and financial results in the second half of the year we took advantage of a favorable capital markets environment in the first quarter of  by accessing the bond market for  million of senior notes at a  coupon  this opportunistic financing enabled us to repay all of the outstanding debt under our  senior notes extend our debt maturity profile and term out  million of revolver borrowings  we continue to have a positive outlook on our business and we believe well see growth accelerate as we move throughout the year  our customers are increasing their drilling and completion activity behind our systems and many have taken steps to strengthen their balance sheets and enhance their capital position to execute their growth plans  in addition we are encouraged by the level of commercial activity we are seeing and we are evaluating a number of opportunities around our existing system footprints and in new basins  financial guidance smlp is reaffirming its  financial guidance with adjusted ebitda expected to range from  million to  million and an annualized fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda run rate between  million and  million  smlp expects to incur  million to  million of capex in  including maintenance capex of  million to  million  smlps  capex guidance reflects the inclusion

natural gas gathering system in service and under development spanning the condensate liquidsrich and dry gas windows of the utica shale in harrison guernsey noble belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  segment adjusted ebitda for the utica shale includes our proportional share of adjusted ebitda from ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag  the utica shale reportable segment also includes summit utica the natural gas gathering system we operate which is currently in service and under development in belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  summit utica gathers and delivers dry natural gas to interconnections with a thirdparty intrastate pipeline which provides access to the clarington hub  segment adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  totaled  million up  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to significantly higher volume throughput across summit utica partially offset by lower volume throughput on ohio gathering and lower stabilization revenue at ohio condensate  volume throughput on the ohio gathering system which is based on a onemonth lag averaged  mmcfd gross in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd gross in the prioryear period and  mmcfd gross in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput on ohio gathering in the first quarter of  was impacted by natural declines from existing wells on the system  ohio gathering commissioned the larew compressor station in march  which is expected to facilitate incremental dry gas production beginning in the second quarter of  and generates an incremental compression fee on all dry gas volumes  currently our customers are running five drilling rigs across the ohio gathering footprint and we expect to see the volume benefit from this activity beginning in the second half of   volume throughput on the summit utica system averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd in the prioryear period and  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput for the first quarter of  increased relative to the prioryear period due to our continued buildout of the summit utica gathering system and our connection of  new wells throughout  and another four new wells during the first quarter of   we expect volumes on summit utica will continue to grow throughout the balance of the year as new wells located on new and existing pad sites are completed  in april  we commissioned a new project to offload capacity constrained natural gas from a thirdparty gathering system adjacent to the summit utica system  we expect this project to significantly increase volumes on summit utica beginning in the second quarter of  albeit at a lower gathering rate given that we are providing highpressure gathering and compression services and not lowpressure wellhead gathering services williston basin the bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream systems provide our midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment  bison midstream gathers associated natural gas production in mountrail and burke counties in north dakota and delivers to thirdparty pipelines serving a thirdparty processing plant in channahon illinois  the polar and divide system gathers crude oil production in williams and divide counties in north dakota and delivers to the colt and basin transload rail terminals as well as other thirdparty intra and interstate pipelines  the polar and divide system also gathers and delivers produced water to various thirdparty disposal wells in the region  tioga midstream is a crude oil produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in williams county north dakota  all crude oil and natural gas gathered on the tioga midstream system is delivered to thirdparty pipelines and all produced water is delivered to thirdparty disposal wells segment adjusted ebitda for the williston basin segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the prioryear period  compared to the prioryear period first quarter  volumes were negatively impacted due to a minimal number of new wells being commissioned behind our gathering systems during the first quarter of   in addition to lower volumes a certain williston customer has gathering rates that reset up or down annually based on actual volumes delivered relative to a predetermined schedule  the higher gathering rates that we enjoyed for this particular customer in the first quarter of  were lowered in the second half of  and impacted our sequential quarterly and yearoveryear comparisons for this segment  without any new drilling activity in  we would expect to see gathering rates for this particular customer to reset higher in   the williston basin segment benefitted from the recognition of  million in the first quarter of  related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim associated with the temporary suspension of produced water gathering activities in      liquids volumes averaged  mbbld in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to the fourth quarter of   lower liquids volumes were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the polar and divide system as no new wells were commissioned during the quarter  certain of our customers remain active across the polar and divide system with three drilling rigs currently working and adding to an existing backlog of more than  drilled uncompleted wells ducs currently behind our williston gathering systems  we expect many of these ducs to begin to be commissioned over the next several months following the startup of new thirdparty longhaul takeaway pipeline associated natural gas volumes averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and flat compared to the fourth quarter of   volume declines were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the bison midstream and tioga midstream systems as only three new wells were connected during the quarter  in addition the severe winter weather experienced late in the fourth quarter of  continued into the beginning of  and negatively impacted volumes during the quarter relative to the prioryear period      piceancedj basins the grand river and the niobrara gp systems provide our midstream services for the piceancedj basins reportable segment  these systems provide natural gas gathering and processing services for producers operating in the piceance basin located in western colorado and eastern utah and in the denverjulesburg dj basin located in northeastern colorado   segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period  first quarter  volume throughput averaged  mmcfd an increase of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and flat with the fourth quarter of   volume growth relative to the prioryear period was primarily due to ongoing drilling and completion activity from our singlebasin focused private equitybacked customers  these customers commissioned dozens of new wells across our piceance and dj basin gathering systems in  and in the first quarter of  these customers commissioned another  new wells  this activity was partially offset by the impact of our anchor customers continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin and the resulting natural declines from existing production  this impact of our anchor customers volume declines was partially offset by higher minimum volume commitment mvc shortfall payment adjustments associated with our gas gathering agreements  certain of our customers remain active across our piceance and dj gathering systems with three drilling rigs currently working barnett shale the dfw midstream system provides our midstream services for the barnett shale reportable segment  this system gathers and delivers lowpressure natural gas received from pad sites primarily located in southeastern tarrant county texas to downstream intrastate pipelines serving various natural gas hubs in the region  segment adjusted ebitda for the barnett shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  a decrease of  from the prioryear period  volume throughput of  mmcfd in the first quarter of  was down  compared to the prioryear period average of  mmcfd and flat with the fourth quarter of   no new wells were commissioned behind the dfw gathering system in the first quarter of  but drilling activity behind the system has recently increased with two rigs added to the field since the end of the first quarter of  and workover rigs returning several dormant wells to service late in the first quarter of   this increased level of activity is largely due to the customer turnover weve experienced behind the system in the last several quarters and we expect that it will lead to increasing volumes in the second half of  marcellus shale the mountaineer midstream system provides our midstream services for the

wwwsummitmidstreamcom prior to the beginning of each conference use of nongaap financial measures we report financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also present adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow each a nongaap financial measure  we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization our proportional adjusted ebitda for equity method investees adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments unitbased and noncash compensation deferred purchase price obligation expense early extinguishment of debt expense impairments and other noncash expenses or losses less interest income income tax benefit income loss from equity method investees and other noncash income or gains  we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda plus cash interest received and cash taxes received less cash interest paid senior notes interest adjustment cash taxes paid and maintenance capital expenditures  because adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other entities in our industry our definitions of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities thereby diminishing their utility management uses these nongaap financial measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our financial performance furthermore management believes that these nongaap financial measures may provide external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others adjusted ebitda is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector without regard to financing or capital structure the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities and the financial performance of our assets without regard to i income or loss from equity method investees ii the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or iii the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items distributable cash flow is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make future cash distributions and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities both of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap for example certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are significant components in understanding and assessing an entitys financial performance such as an entitys cost of capital and tax structure adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements we compensate for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap financial measures understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decisionmaking process reconciliations of gaap to nongaap financial measures are attached to this press release we do not provide the gaap financial measures of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities on a forwardlooking basis because we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort certain components thereof including but not limited to i income or loss from equity method investees ii deferred purchase price obligation income
