knockoff batteries that fail to operate the board properly we at best reviews online recommend searching for a hoverboard that has certified lg batteries these batteries contain cells that contact heat and wont allow the battery pack to overheat at high temperatures a few reputable hoverboard companies were judicious and spent extra dollars by building with quality lg batteries   battery cells and quality as consumers our aim is to determine what peculiarities exist between models and brands that appear to be largely identical on the surface and sometimes sell at vastly different prices thus quality of hoverboards should be on the list the search for hoverboards has become a difficult discovery in that it’s impossible to know exactly who is making what which brands are in copycat mode and who is telling the truth however our recommendation is to first start with a company that has certified lg batteries they uphold ul certification standards and the extra battery seals protect the cells from any fire due to battery failure   warranty we recommend purchasing a hoverboard from a company that doesnt shy away from providing a warranty a six month warranty should be in play at the minimum to ensure you can still have technical assistance even months after your purchase when looking to buy a hoverboard make sure the warranty does cover most technical issues that might arise   not recalled it is an absolute must to now search for a board that is not on the recall list of the cpsc while some of these boards were recalled initially most of these companies have gotten proper certificates and are now back on the market it is important to note that ul has come out with a ul  certification for hoverboards so make sure to look out for hoverboards that are ul  compliant domain
