limousines wont spill their pampered contents for another two hours but a battery of cameras has already begun its siege its late afternoon in the no mans land outside the red carpet of manhattans sam s shubert theatre as in any scene of plotted hoopla the crowd is as selfpropagating as a virus celebrities draw photographers flashbulbs draw tourists gawkers validate the celebrities thickets of tripods jostle above the media fence while grunts in bulging safari vests calibrate television cameras every lens is focused on the theater door in brilliant electricity the words “bernadette peters” and “gypsy” sear through the highrise shadows its opening night on broadway “this is probably a stupid question” a woman asks the cashier inside the box office “but you wouldnt have any tickets left would you” it is indeed a stupid question tickets have been held for names that have long since been burned into the public retina kate winslet and mia farrow matthew broderick and nathan lane susan lucci joel grey even — reverent pause — tom hanks opening night is for people with a scrolling corinthian capital “p” people like miramaxs harvey weinstein who shakes and greets his way down the aisle mobbed by suppliant hands or new york mayor michael bloomberg who has proclaimed “curtain up on gypsy day” in new york people with names and influence with glamour as the lights draw out the sparkle and noise of the opening act and bernadette peters strides from the darkness with the cry “sing out louise” the man clapping hardest is also one of the least likely to be there almost as incongruous as the floral midwesterners populating the balcony he is in fact a yearold electronics engineer from revere a grandfatherly computer nerd — albeit one with the healthy coloring and firm handshake that come from lots of golf and holidays in tuscany he is giddy with excitement and he is sitting improbably close to tom hanks this is because he is roger marino a founder of and the “m” in the multibilliondollar massachusetts computer giant emc he is also one of the producers of the show any broadway producer on the flip side of max bialystock is filthy rich and marino is among the richest ten years after he retired from it hopkintonbased emc remains the biggest shark in the yawning deeps of an industry — data storage — that most people dont understand assuming they even know it exists its massachusetts most valuable company its market capitalization passed gillettes way back in  and though few people in dedham where he now lives could probably readily identify him marino has been dubbed a “demibillionaire” with a net worth once estimated at as much as  billion that was admittedly during the technology boom but his current bank balance is nonetheless reliably muttered to still be in the hundreds of millions one day he was lying by the pool talking to his broker on the phone “buy” he would say and “sell” after a while it occurred to him to question whether this was a useful thing to do “i dont think so” marino says “what a bunch of bullshit that is you might as well become a lawyer” it was time for reinvention and so began the tale of the rich man who could buy just about anything and decided to go hollywood marino became an executive producer of movies including the upcoming ill sleep when im dead and an adaptation of john irvings novel a widow for one year called the door in the floor he bought and later sold the pittsburgh penguins he tried to buy the red sox he invested in a broadway show of course these are expensive hobbies hockey teams may be playthings but theyre playthings for a rarefied income bracket and while paupers often meddle in theater production few will ever boast a bernadette peters marino jokingly told a boston globe reporter that he left sports after dropping  million on the penguins and went into the movie business “because i hear you can lose a lot of money doing that” he is said to have since spent at least another  million on his films other rich executives have traded cash for bigscreen credits federal express founder fred smith microsoft cofounder paul allen and ebay cofounder jeff skoll have all produced films some have even made a killing at it gateway computer cofounder norm waitt jr bankrolled my big fat greek wedding but marino is different he also wants to direct hes “a lot more than just your average guy with a lot of money” says michael corrente  marinos partner in revere pictures a fledgling movie production outfit that the two formed two years ago “hes very very well versed and literate in the world of cinema” indeed he is few fortune  executives would cite the  richard burton drama look back in anger as a profound influence nor does marino need much prompting to trumpet the beauties of cinema arcana he lists bryan forbess the lshaped room tony richardsons the loneliness of the long distance runner and lindsay andersons this sporting life as celluloid masterpieces and he has a taste for subtitles “i first started liking french cinema when i was a kid because of the sex” he says “then i started appreciating the art” in addition to ill sleep when im dead and the door in the floor marinos revere pictures — named for his hometown — is about to release a thriller called corn and a flick for young adults when zachary beaver came to town based on a book of the same name thats for the future though as the curtain comes down at the shubert theatre the night bubbles with camera strobes and champagne with cheekkissing and selfcongratulation in the center of it stands roger marino snug in the coils of celebrity how marino ended up there is a story not unlike a broadway ragstosequins fable his father was a selfeducated tailor who took the boat from naples in  then slept in doorways before getting work in a shop within the shadow of the elevated orange line on forsyth street next to northeastern university the younger marino would one day plant the family name on a futuristic  million recreation center to which he and his wife gave  million the old man worked hard and crossed the water to revere where he and his family lived a relatively comfortable existence “i didnt grow up poor” says marino who still speaks with the hammered vowels and street consonants of the north shore “it wasnt a bad neighborhood at all i took the trolley to the beach” and to less sweaty diversions “my father took me to operas when i was a kid” he says “puccini and joe green giuseppe verdi i grew up with opera in the house” more significantly he became a regular visitor to the revere theater “twelve cents for two movies and a serial” he remembers marino went through the expected motions of a sepiatinged childhood one set of relatives in the walkup above another in the apartment below sandlot baseball sandlot football street basketball every game apparently except hockey he worked on one of the towns two remaining farms and even walked behind a horse once or twice “not plowing” he says “but turning up the dirt to air it out” after graduating from revere high school marino carpooled to northeastern with three or four of the neighborhood boys and earned himself a degree in electrical engineering “electrical not electronic” he stresses although he worked as an electronics engineer after he graduated this led naturally enough toward breakneck thrills in the exciting world of early computer development “from the early s on boston became more technical” marino says “there was no need for travel outside i stayed in boston my whole career” by  he had a wife janice lundgren and two daughters they would later divorce marino remarried and had three more children including a set of twins but marino found that engineering whatever its glories lacked vim “there wasnt enough action i went into marketing and then i went to smaller companies to get closer to the action” he stuck his foot into startup ventures newton of course had something to say about actions and their opposites and for every push to the heavens the unwashed hand of reality comes crashing down with all the bludgeoning malice of the cosmos “i started a couple of failures” says marino and then just when it seemed that the natural state of an object ought to be at rest he found movement in  marino and a northeastern friend dick egan founded emc this company would become a winner changing both their lives reshaping an industry and becoming one of massachusetts biggest employers “we started off as manufacturers reps selling peddling on the street” says bob blanding the third person to join emc and now ceo of technical applications associates “emc started on a card table the current mrs marino was our rentasecretary i remember the typewriter sitting there on that rickety card table and michelle marino — st pierre at the time — typing away” any fledgling business is less a walk in the park than a stroll through a minefield crammed with alligators emcs early years proved no exception “it was hard work” says greg strakosch who worked under marino during the s and who is now the ceo of techtarget a media company specializing in information technology “we were selling a very unsexy product computer memory and disk drives and we were competing against ibm which had a  percent market share we were fighting goliath” unlike the technology firms that would one day selfimmolate on pyres of torched ipos emc survived by blending rockskulled business sense with something rare in the hightech milieu frugality nor was the vigor of its staff a handicap “i hired guys i liked” marino says “i like smart people i like athletes these guys that worked for me were smart athletes and they went out and killed” “roger is one of the best salesmen i ever knew” says blanding who left emc in  “he got our first order” it was for computer desks furniture being emcs first line of product before it became a manufacturer “roger said well just bring the order right up to the customer about  minutes before we were ready to leave roger said im tied up youre going to have to take that in yourself i took it in there was construction and i had to drag these large computer desks down the sidewalk and up two flights of stairs to his customer and he did forget to say thank you” “i found that it was not a good idea to go out to lunch” says annie tulley who joined emc as its fourth employee and left in  “because they would have sold my desk it was probably the best job i ever had in my life though you were never bored” the ghost of horatio alger or perhaps of gordon gekko walked emc through those early years by  the company had swelled into a fullblooded giant hiccups did occur — “events” as marino calls them “burning crashes that almost kill people” in  and  for example emc lost  million because of contaminated disk drives it bought from japanese manufacturer nec “we had a war chest of about  million in the bank if we didnt have that wed have been dead” even today marino waxes sarcastic about “japanese reliability” but by  he was able to retire his fortune padlocked tight marino then faced what has been termed the conundrum of the lucky bastard

influences on growing up in a tripledecker on boston’s north shore  “i grew up in revere massachusetts at  north avenue and i lived in the middle floor of a threefloor building my grandmother and grandfather and a couple of their kids lived on the bottom floor and a couple of their kids lived on the top floor”  as a child in revere massachusetts on his father immigrating to america from italy in the early twentieth century my father came from naples italy in  he was  years old he claimed that in the first couple of weeks he lived in doorways in boston because he couldn’t find a place to eat and sleep so he had to get a job on his father being his greatest inspiration “he has always been my hero he was a hard worker he was very studious he read a lot he read a lot of poetry he was an art appreciator in that he had poems and artwork and he loved opera   roger marino and his father anthony on a sunday morning in  northeastern reflections on why he studied engineering at northeastern i was really interested in science i loved science when i was high school in fact i have a scholarship dedicated to one of my science teachers from high school at revere high peter cerasoli on how coop made his northeastern education possible “coop is key my father paid for my first two tuition bills which were  each per term and i paid from there on in they did supply me with roomandboard because i commuted in a volkswagen every day to school”  on launching emc with fellow trustee richard egan e’ h’ “i got a phone call from dick egan saying ‘i would like to meet at the marriott in newton’ that’s where all good businesses meet central location we met one night and he said ‘listen you’ve been in a few companies i’ve been in a few companies some have gone out of business let’s start our own company and if it goes out of business it’s our fault’”   roger marino and richard egan center with president joseph e aoun    philanthropy and giving back on the importance of giving back “it’s because i think you have to give back i give back in two areas health and education and i work with revere high and i give scholarships there and i work with northeastern and i enjoyed northeastern’” roger marino with torch scholars on why he supports the torch scholars program “i had a talk with richard freeland a while ago and i sat down and said ‘you know this university is getting so popular and so good people like me can’t come here anymore’ and you have heard that a thousand times since then” campus transformation and great momentum on how much it means that the marino center was built close to where his father worked in a factory “i said that in the groundbreaking speech and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house when i said it it’s pretty touching that you can build a building where your father used to work in a factory” singing a beam during the marino center construction on his first visits to the iconic marino recreation center “i was impressed it of course bowled me over when i saw it in person i will tell you when i really was bowled over—when i saw it at night all lit up against the boston background that was just amazing that’s when it was really pretty” the marino center at night on northeasterns physical transformation since the late s “when i was coming here i never got lost when i come here now i get lost that’s really kind of an overview of what the difference is i’ve taken pictures on my iphone now of various parts of northeastern that show how pretty it is i want to show it to people roger marino visiting the marino center on northeasterns great progress and momentum “i think the progress that i have seen through my years has just been spectacular it would take a book to describe the type of progress that was made here through all of its presidents i am really happy to see that this president joseph aoun can take it to another level which i thought was impossible and he is doing it” president aoun and roger marino this interview is available in its entirety in the northeastern university archives photos roger marino heratch ekmekjian and university libraries archives and special collections department biography hailing from a modest background roger marino learned the value of hard work early in life—his father worked as a tailor in a factory that was a stone’s throw from the northeastern campus when roger arrived at northeastern in  as an engineering student he quickly made the most of the opportunities afforded him and earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering » read more northeastern home
