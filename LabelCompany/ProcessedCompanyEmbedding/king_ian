purchasethe perfect king is a very enjoyable to book to read mortimer seems to understand the importance of keeping the story part of history in the telling of the life edward iii mortimer can be both funny and serious at the same time as any good history professor who has to lecture in front of students his subject is a fascinating one king edward iii came to throne after his fathers violent overthrow and for the first few years of his reign was under the thumb of the man who brought down his father roger mortimer the earl of march edward would survive to dispose of mortimer and become one of the most successful kings in english history he was a warrior prince who would humble france like none before him his son prince edward would succeed in capturing frances king john ii and bring to england a prisoner one of the main themes of the book is how the kings legacy would change through the ages although he was considered one of the greatest monarchs for five hundred years after his death in the nineteenth century historians took a much more critical view emphasizing his faults and failings while ignoring his good traits and record of success mortimer tries to tell edwards story to be understood in the context of edwards own eraprobably the intriguing argumentif not the most famousthat mortimer tries to advance in this book is the theory that edward ii did not die in berkeley castle but lived on into  in the past i had never really questioned edward iis death not even the brutality of it the hot poker story i had heard criticized on the grounds of it being too gruesome but i always thought that a silly argument for it was brutal time period where people disemboweled as a form of execution in such context the hot poker story seemed very probable to me i still think he died at berkeley but this book did make me pause the part that got me the most was the whole william the welshman royal pretender who is not only spared from any punishment but is also entertained at royal expense and gets to the meet the family maybe edward iis body should be exhumed to determine what age he was at before he diededward iii is most famous for his war with france and his reputation is as a great warrior king mortimer shows in this story that edward was an excellent and imaginative tactician who not only waged war but change the very way it was fought in the western world he would win victory after victory nearly reclaiming all the lands lost by his greatgreatgrandfather king johnuntil now gunpowder had only been used in sieges with the sole exception of mortimers use of crakkis of war on the stanhope campaign those had been dangerous exploding buckets by comparison with edwards refined guns as well as small cannon with calibres of roughly four inches the shot were still stone he brought his newly developed ribaldsseries of bound gun barrels designed to shoot metal bolts like crossbow bolts and edward had not only developed them he had thought of how to use them too pwhere edward iii does not get a lot of credit is in his abilities as a lawmaker while his grandfather king edward i had the first model parliament it was actually king edward iii whose parliaments were model it was under edward iii that the two chambers of house of lords and house of commons formed it was also during edwards reign that the commons had actually begun to have a real role in the making of law that was respected and consistent edward iii had a strong relationship with the parliamentedward was a man who listened to his representatives and held a dialogue with them even if he did not or could not agree to their demands although it is the mass of legislation passed by his grandfather edward i that caught the attention of early legal historians prompting them to call that king the english justinian referring to the great byzantine emperor who codified the roman law edward iii was no less of a legislator but his methods were different he was a lawmaker not a lawgiver he made laws responding to parliamentary demands sometimes these demands allowed him to promote his own agenda for legislation at other times the measures were all but forced upon him as a result of his need to maintain a high level of taxation sometimes even he had his own wishes presented to him in the form of a petition from a magnate but the parliaments of edward iii are remarkable for the breadth and depth of the parliamentary dialogue between king and people so great was edwards contribution that one modern scholar has assigned him the title of second english justinian putting him on a footing equal to that of edward i the codifier of the english common law pone of king edward iii lasting achievements was the creation of the order of the garter an association of twentysix knights including the king and the prince of wales that continues to exist to this dayit was at this point that edward foundedor to be exactcompleted the foundation of the order of the garter on st georges day  at the very height of the most horrific disease the kingdom had ever seen edward held a great tournament at windsor during which he formally instituted his order of twentysix men who would joust and pray together once a year and conduct themselves everywhere like proud arthurian knights pedward tried in every way to be a good king although he was from perfect nevertheless he was an amazing king it is unfortunate that he outlived his glory his sanity and his own heir apparentcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

stoutvine voiceon july  format kindle editionverified purchasethe author points out that his subtitle the perfect king is not because edward iii was the perfect king but that he strived to beedward iii came to his throne early  his mother and her lover deposed his father edward ii and set edward on the throne at age  a few years later tired of being their pawn he manages to remove them from power enamored with jousting and chivalry he practices the arts of chivalry and at the same time reclaims the french throne  which precipitates the hundred years war between england and francethis book does an excellent job of telling the story of edward including both his glorious side and his bloodyminded unrelenting side it draws strongly from original sources the chroniclers of the period as well as later historians perspective and reads very well edwards life and political battles are interesting and complexthere is a sense that the author wishes to restore the honor of edward  he does point out that in the th century edwards reputation is deeply diminished and i occasionally feel that the author excuses a few things that i dont feel comfortable excusingbut overall this is a well research and lively account of a key figure in medieval english history  read it if this era interests youone small note i read the kindle version which was clearly scanned to text in that version there are many small flaws due to the scanning for example clays for days my stars do not reflect that flaw which i was able to look pastcomment  people found this helpful was this review

on an amazing kingbymars ultoron october  format paperbackverified purchasethe perfect king is truly remarkable it is a book of facts yet ian mortimer made it seem like a legend even though it was nonfiction a warrior edward certanly was he brought the use of the gun and longbow together against the scots and the french this along with his stunning and aggressive courage was a truly invincibale tactic but edward wasnt just a warrior he was a lawmaker who was called the second english justinian putting him on the same level as edward i edward was also the greatest english patron of the arts of the late middle ages collecting italian paintings making alabaster tombs and above all creating this majestic castles and churchs when it comes to this book i believe what ian said was right that

on this king one would imagine with all the excitement of his reign from the early execution of mortimer to the hundred years war to the creation of the order of the garter and his final end as a frail elderly man dominated by a greedy mistress there would be sources a plenty for researchhowever the length of the reignalone makes thorough scholarship difficulrmortimer ian is a good historian however i do find he takes liberties with the re corded histories and this can be seen in his nearly singular view that his father edward ii was not killed i have actually read other books that have an appendix added just to refute this see seymore philips great accountit is good for a historian to think outside the box but considering that ones father a king was not killed in his cell and that edward was to learn the truth soon afterward sets him on a path dictated by this for the nearly the whole of his early reign mortimer sees its influence in nearly every decision the king makesa historian cannot base a mans judgement on something that is doubtful reality in this case it would be enough to examine edwards judgement on the fact that his father was the first english king to have his throne taken away by reasons other than war or death that his mother became the mistress of his fathers sworn enemy that in this new reality a weak and misguided king now has precedent to be removed if unpopular these are hard realities for an anointed king who commands through god to acceptif u can overlook this one rather large item which is interesting to consider then the rest of the book is one of the finer accounts dedicated to edward specifically with a layman in mind for those more dedicated read anything by ormond and for the love of god read the epic hundred years war by j

environmental ethics characters ian cheney curt ellis earl l butz other films by director aaron woolf dying to leave  synopsis �two friends with one year to spare and a deep curiosity about the american food distribution system set out to grow and acre of corn and see what becomes of their crop in director aaron woolfs agriculturalthemed documentary ian cheney and curt ellis are best friends from college who have decided to move from the east coast to the midwest in hopes of getting a better idea where the food they consume on a daily basis actually comes from corn is americas most productive and subsidized grain upon relocating to iowa the pair and seeks out the assistance of friends and neighbors in procuring the land seeds fertilizers and herbicides needed to grow a oneacre bumper crop of this highlyversatile commodity as their maize is harvested and the sometimestroubling realities of modern faming begin to emerge the pair sets off on a mission to track the progress of their product and find out just how it is used to create a variety of different food products what emerges is an informative and at times disturbing account of both the food americans so readily consume without so much as a second though and the alarming state of the contemporary agricultural industry�  jason buchanan all movie guide discussion questions  the movie opens with ian and curtis saying that we are the first generation of people that will likely have a shorter life span than our parents largely because of the food we eat a scientist then states that a disproportionally large amount of the carbon in our bodies comes from corn both of these are probably little known facts whose fault is that  since the s us agricultural policy has involved government subsidization for farmers prior to  the government regulated agricultural production by keeping supply and demand in balance which sometimes meant paying farmers to take some farm land out of production this stabilized agricultural prices kept them high and allowed smaller farms to survive was this a good policy as opposed to no policy of restriction or subsidization at all  in  nixon�s agricultural secretary earl l butz reoriented the us farm program by not restricting what a farm can produce butz states in an interview with the film makers that under the old farm program �we paid farmers not to produce one of the stupidest things we ever did i think� according to butz the increased agricultural production in this country has driven food prices down now so that we only pay about  of our incomes on food previous generations paid twice that amount butz acknowledged that this has led to large scale farming where smaller farms can�t compete and while he was secretary of agriculture he routinely told farmers �get big or get out did butz make the right decision  even under butz�s restructured farm program the us government still subsidizes farmers at the time of the movie the government was paying farmers  per acre of corn according to the film if you grow corn without payment from the government you�ll lose money is anything wrong with this policy and what would happen if it was discontinued  according to the film the government subsidy system essentially rewards overproduction of corn one person stated �we subsidize the happy meals but not the healthy meals� is this an accurate assessment of the results of the government subsidy system  corn yield has increased by selecting types of corn plants that grow closer to each other so there are more corn plants per acre this has increased the yield from  bushels per acre in the past to  bushels of corn per acre now the trade off is that it has more starch and less protein is the trade off worth it  most farmers use genetically modified seeds to make crops like corn resistant to the herbicide weed killers eg libertyready roundupready the result is that an entire field can efficiently be sprayed with herbicides without killing the crops this keeps the yield per acre high and thus lowers the cost we pay for food what if anything is bad about this  the corn that ian and curtis grew was essentially inedible in its unprocessed form as one person in the film said �it�s a raw material like feed stock for all these other processes�  specifically ethanol for fuel feed for animals and high fructose corn syrup for food is anything particularly bad about this  corn grain isn�t a healthy food for cows and too much of it will produce acidosis which will kill them large cattle feedlots are unsanitary and expose the cows to diseases antibiotics are put into corn feed to help combat both acidosis and disease from confinement about  of the antibiotics in this country go to that purpose all of this is driven by economics corn is cheap food and confinement allows cows to put on weight quickly is the tradeoff worth it  according to one expert in the film the muscle in factory farmed cows looks more like fat tissue than muscle tissue steak from grainfed cows has about  times the saturated fat as grass fed cows again this is driven by economics steak with less saturated fat would mean spending more money on how cows are raised is the tradeoff worth it  the corn sweetener industry emerged as an outlet for the excess corn that was produced after farming was deregulated about  of high fructose corn syrup goes into beverage sweeteners one problem this creates is obesity one expert stated that drinking calories doesn�t produce the digestive �stop signals� that eating calories does another problem with sweet beverages is that it contributes to type  diabetes can we really blame corn sweetener or earl butz for this  near the end of the film the narrator states �we spend less of our income on food than any generation in history and fewer of us are needed to produce that food than ever before but we also might be the first generation to live in a time when abundance brings too much� is the narrator right reviews �king corn� opened my eyes to the food industry i was not aware of the millions and billions of dollars that are made off of this simple crop the two men that made the documentary were very interested in corn i really did not care too much about this certain topic but now i do i find myself looking at the labels on all the food i consume and wondering is there high fructose corn syrup in them what really hit home were the images of the man putting his hand inside the cow and removing the waste if these grains can harm cows them they certainly can cause damage to our bodies now that i see the problems the feed can cause us i really want to start eating grass feed beef cattle this is healthier for us and our children to come i did notice how the women they interviewed had a very flat affect she seemed like nothing was bothering her and that everything she was doing was right i do appreciate the film and its filmmakers for showing this to the public we as the consumer need to be more educated on what we are putting into our bodies at some points in the movie i did fall asleep but i got the main overall purpose of the film it made me feel bad for some of the small mom and pop farmers but this was soon going to happen with the modernization of the world i would recommend people to see this film as well � cj king corn was an alright documentary it didn�t try to shove the filmmakers viewpoints down your throat like some others anything michael moore super size me religulous it did open my eyes to this whole world of corn production and particularly to the fact that corn is in virtually everything that we eat as far as the agricultural side of the movie the only part that surprised me was the huge surplus of corn that is stocked up and left over from year to year are there not other things that this surplus can be used in besides food products for humans or livestock the production of high fructose corn syrup and its implementation into almost every sweetened product on the food market was pretty astonishing the biggest surprise was the cattle farms that immobilize the cattle as much as possible and just pumped this corn into them basically i prefer lean meat and would rather have beef from better animals but i do understand the supply and demand issue that raising cattle in this way helps solve however i will be cutting down on my sweetened drinks intake at least for a while � te i really enjoyed king corn i don�t watch many documentaries anymore thanks to america�s douche bag michael moore but this one has really jump started my interest again i had no idea how the agriculture system in america worked this film did a great job at showing the process of overproduction of resources we are overproducing corn and using it in everything from food to fuel but the film shows how this process is not so decidedly good or evil there are pros and cons to the overproduction of food one major benefit of over production is cheaper food lower food costs make it easier for us to not only feed ourselves but also to help feed the less fortunate that appeals to the utilitarian mindset that america seems to have but a drawback to cheap food is that quality suffers also because food is so cheap we tend to eat more obesity is plaguing our country and it appears that by trying to make things better we have only created other problems this movie has a ton of great topics for thought it has made a lasting impact on me now i buy the more expensive �healthy� groceries i also drink about a tenth of the soft drinks that i did before seeing this movie the guys really did a good job of presenting an unbiased opinion and presenting only facts � jr king corn was an eye opening movie and i still look at the ingredient list on things i buy it showed how different today�s farmers and the farmers from the �s and �s are the industrial age has changed the life style of farmers and how they grow their crops i too thought that farmers still toiled over their crop everyday and had to take a lot of care in doing so but when ian and curtis begin to grow their crop they realize that it�s more of a waiting game than what most of us would think of when we think of farming also the image of a farmer growing his own food was shattered when ian tried to at the corn and it was practically inedible the fact that a farmer who grows thousands of acres of corn and cannot even feed his family with it is very shocking to me one man is quoted in the movie saying it�s a raw material  it being corn like feed stock for all these other processes i believe that there is something wrong with growing food that you cannot eat we should strive to make food healthier not alter it in a way that makes it inedible we can make it so we can use it in so many ways that other foods can already do also another man is quoted saying we subsidize the happy meals but not the healthy meals this movie has made me rethink the way i look at food and what i choice to eat � dh the movie king corn was the first documentary movie i have ever watched and i really enjoyed it the movie in essence gives the down low on the corn industry and how it affects the american culture throughout the movie you journey with two young men from the boston metropolitan area to rural iowa upon arrival at iowa they somehow got a farmer to let them �borrow� an acre of land to plant corn on during their odyssey they speak with many researchers and experts on corn and how it has transformed american culture the uprising of corn from a simple plant in mexico to an inedible crop in america is an intriguing story that has an ugly side to it corn as a raw material has many uses particularly high fructose corn syrup this ingredient has many uses especially in food if you look at almost any food label you will find that particular ingredient this ingredient has been linked to causing the obesity epidemic we also learn the complicated side of farm economics and how subsidies manipulate the corn economy some farms are paid to under produce and over produce but at what cost the cost is the implication that small farms cannot survive without merging with larger farms in the industry overall i really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anybody who enjoys documentaries and being educated on current events � jm king corn presented me with enough information about the negative impacts of the corn industry to make me swear off soda and beef as an american consumer i rarely think about where the products i eat and drink come from apparently ian and curtis were also unaware of the origin of food this coupled with a finding that most of their hair samples were composed of corn led them on a journey to figure out the cornbased food economy while there were several scenes that were shocking in this film a few stand out in my mind as especially heinous the most disturbing image of the film was the holey cow i was amazed to learn that the cornbased diet these cows were being fed actually ate up their stomachs not only is this an instance of animal cruelty it seems like a health risk for those that consume beef the standard of living for corn farmers was also a concern brought up in this movie the farmers were growing a crop they knew was subpar and still barely making a profit off of it at first it seems difficult to empathize with the farmers because they chose to go into this profession however in small midwestern towns there are not very many job opportunities also the farmers have little control over the quality of corn they grow they take whatever kind of corn the government is willing to pay them to grow if they chose to grown a different type of corn and did not take advantage of government aid most farmers would go out of business due to high cost of farming and low crop prices � do king corn this documentary style film observed the journey corn takes from the stalk through its processing and utilization in a smorgasbord of emptycalorie foods largely unbeknownst to the majority of those consuming these foods for this reason i found this film incredibly interesting and informative not to mention aesthetically pleasing and artistically superb the scenes presented in this film shed precious light on important health issues the american people are currently facing at the price of cheap bountiful amounts of tasty but unhealthy food containing what is referred to as high fructose corn syrup manufactured from highly processed corn this high fructose corn syrup is a cheap and tasty replacement for regular table sugar but as this documentary reveals comes at a price providing no nutritional value this mass production of corn does not only affect the corn industry as well as those foods with high fructose corn syrup it also largely influences the beef industry as the narrators of the film explain forcing cows to consume mass produced corn in order to speed up their growth is a cheap and easy alternative to simply allowing cows to graze and develop naturally in this way cow farmers can save more money on buying cow feed and make money faster by growing cows at a faster rate and selling them for meat sooner however stuffing cows with corn feed is terribly unhealthy for the cows as researchers in the movie state if the cows were not killed so quickly they would instead have died from food poisoning as corn does not digest correctly within the stomachs of a cow it has aversive effects on their body when forced to consume it also growing the cows in this way causes their meat to be much more fatty as opposed to how grassfed cows are more lean and healthy this means that corn is not only poisoning an incredibly amount of foods consumed unknowingly by many people every day it is also causing other animals to yield more fatty products thus being increasingly less healthy for us at the top of the food chain i found this movie particularly interesting as it highlighted the cost of the age of plenty � jd king corn is a documentary about two friends ian cheney and curt ellis use one acre of land to test the nutritional value of modern corn agriculture they realized that the burgers sodas and candy are all composed of corn this movie was eye opening and has made me rethink my diet this movie helped me understand the importance of eating healthier and more aware of what is better for my body after hearing the statistic if you drink a soda a day you double your chances of getting type two diabetes i started being more aware of how many empty calories corn syrup offers and that it is only a sweetener and has chemicals in it that i don�t in my body they presented interesting facts about how cows cannot live past four months of being corn feed before they get sick and even die ian and curt even try eating the corn they produced and discovered that eating it raw is not exactly fulfilling nor palatable i thought that this film effectively and intelligently informs its audience of the dangers eating fast food the film never once seemed to stand on a soap box instead it offers the viewer a chance to reevaluate exactly how much high fructose corn syrup is commonly used this film also helped me understand the history and philosophy of agriculture over the past few decades however i found the aesthetic value of this movie to be pleasing and in accord to the movie as a whole for all ages � dm an informative journey through the science history and policy behind america�s favorite source of empty calories king corn raises consciousness on why eating cheaply may not mean eating better the film follows the lives of two college friends as they move to iowa to grow an acre of corn for a year after learning through laboratory analysis that their bodies are made up mostly of the yellow stuff the viewer quickly learns that most of what they eat is derived from corn in one way or another sweetened with high fructose corn syrup thickened with cornstarch etc even most beef on the market today is corn or corn derivative fed not only does it result is beef that is less healthy but cheap the consumption of a primarily grain diet is harmful to cows resulting in acidosis � not to mention the horrid conditions of feed lots in which cows are confined until they reach market weight but king corn is not interested necessarily in animal rights but in whether or not the current policy of over production of corn which has led to cheap prices and inferior corn is really such a good idea sure americans spend less money on food than ever before but at what cost to our health the most poignant scene is an interview with earl butz the us secretary of agriculture who is primarily responsible for the change in us policy which led to today�s over production agenda if you live in the us and eat then this documentary is a must see king corn was an extremely welldone documentary the two filmmakers ian and curtis played an active role in the film without being the �stars� their plan to grow an acre of corn is a novel idea by today�s standards most college graduates without an agriculture degree have no interest in growing corn especially such a small plot of it i enjoyed watching ian and curtis operate the farm machinery the information about corn syrup was alarming it is in almost every packaged food we consume many people consume only packaged food i liked watching the scientists make corn syrup although it was a bit disturbing to see what it actually looks like before it is put in my food the makers of king corn were not out to �get� anyone they reported the facts and the different obstacles they experienced this film was special to me because i worked at a grainery in the summer of  although i worked only during wheat season i heard horror stories of how angry farmers got if their corn didn�t get the grades they thought it deserved one detail i liked about the film was the use of the toy farm and small plastic farmers it was an original way to transition different parts of the film i had the exact same farm and toys when i was little and it was entertaining to see them onscreen these filmmakers objectively showed audiences objective facts and figures and did not propagandize the film for their own cause this method shows how credible and disturbing the statistics really are � cr king corn this movie had a huge impact on my diet and buying habits for a week or two actually because of this movie i have instituted a �no high fructose corn syrup� boycott at least personally the kids have to have it to survive i believe i was completely unaware of the impact of the corn industry and i at first found myself being upset with the corn growers after more careful inspection i found the blame pointing toward our government which only responses i believe to the electorate we have become so complacent that most americans are unaware of the items we ingest and this film brought that home to me the movie required me to inspect my own behavior to see what is the true cause of the state of our health in america i was also drawn into the movie because of the back story of the two young film makers even if their relationship was odd they seemed courageous to research their own family history and find the ties to a subject worth documenting they could have just done a documentary film about some random topic and make a living but the strove to connect to the story and make the audience become interested in the lesson to be taught the last scene with them playing baseball in the unplanted field was the best ending in a documentary i have ever seen the film demonstrates the lengths two young graduates will go to not to find a real job � lt   king of the masquerade  ian randle publishers contact    login username
