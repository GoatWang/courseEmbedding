equates chaos with opportunity by rance crain published on july   most popular when kay koplovitz founded the first adsupported cable channel usa network in  cable needed bundles of channels to succeed now viewers are unbundling making it a very challenging time for advertising kay told me prior to her induction into the advertising hall of fame an advertisers message needs to be seen by the exact person to whom its going to matter she said people dont mind the advertising but they dont want to watch the advertising that doesnt address them its a chaotic time and a fascinating time kay said shes been surprised at how quickly some of the upstart streaming channels like netflix amazon and hulu have produced highcaliber programming and theyve fostered the growth of binge viewing a phenomenon that the established cable networks were forced to copy ive always loved chaos because in chaos theres opportunity she said today we have some of the bestwritten and bestproduced television series of all time when kay began her career the biggest challenge was to launch enough satellite dishes to receive signals from the new cable networks then hbo at the time a client of kays changed the course of television history she said by telecasting via satellite the thrilla in manila boxing match in  between muhammad ali and joe frazier but she said the questions remained how could you start a cable business with so few subscribers and the ones that did exist were mostly in rural areas using cable antenna systems called catv and how could you deliver original programming without a business plan nobody to sell advertising to and nobody to watch it kays big idea was to reverse the network model have the cable operators pay for the programming and in turn give them timeslots to sell local advertising the first package that kay brought to the operators consisted of  events from madison square garden which was why usa network was then called madison square garden network she then added major league baseball the nba nhl and more the cable operators were happy to pay for sports because they were gaining subscribers rapidly the whole idea was to have live sports every single night and i achieved that in the second year kay recalled but then the companys ownership reorganized and no longer wanted msgn—which it renamed usa network—to be in sports i argued so hard for another separate sports network i think it was a huge mistake not to stay in sports she said one other battle kay lost—it really angered me she said—was a deal to buy fnn she realized in the late s that financial reporting would be simple to cover you dont have to send people to war zones you just have them at desks she said and it was hoursaday trading she partnered with the wall street journal and after a year of negotiating had the needed approval but just when she was literally signing the contract kay got a call from sid sheinberg of universal studios who said he changed his mind and heres a story about a deal kay thought shed lost but ended up winning she went to george steinbrenner the legendary head of the new york yankees to pitch him on carrying the teams away games the first game yankees vs the red sox in april of  went  innings it was the perfect game to start with she said the next day kay got a call from bowie kuhn then commissioner of mlb who told kay she didnt have the rights to carry the game—even though she had the signed contract in front of her—and who threatened to get a restraining order to stop her from cablecasting more games kay told him shed trade the deal with the yankees for a deal with mlb to televise games from all the teams there was silence she said then kuhn said ill see you in my office tomorrow morning at  oclock ms koplovitz and that was how she traded the yankees for mlb in  kay started springboard enterprises as a venture capital firm to help women in tech raise money to bring products to market some numbers she cited springboard has brought  companies through the program and her companies have raised more than  billion in venture capital women still do not raise money at par with the market she said but they outperform the market kay said she has been most influenced by the great sciencefiction writer arthur c clarke whom she heard lecture on geosynchronous orbiting satellites it had a profound effect on me she said it was a reason why she started the syfy channel launched as scifi channel in  which combined her love of science and storytelling but kay warned were in danger of people who dont believe in science influencing policies  i think we need to have more storytelling about the great scientists of the time and how theyve actually impacted our society so i think thats what i would say about who kay
