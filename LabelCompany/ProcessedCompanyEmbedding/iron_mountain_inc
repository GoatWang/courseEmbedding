mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the new jersey turnpike usa at exit  full of corporate documents this was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away both buildings are owned by iron mountain inc in may  time warner disclosed that a container of  unencrypted backup tapes containing the personal information of  current and former employees had disappeared while being transported in an iron mountain van that made  other stops in manhattan that day after the loss time warner began encrypting its tapes and iron mountain advised its other clients to do the same a year later tapes containing personal information for about  long island rail road employees were lost while in transit to the railroads office along with tapes belonging to the us department of veterans affairs being shipped in the same vehicle in july  a fire completely destroyed a leased sixstory company warehouse in london the paper records of  customers including

customers to the more expensive advanced newer productproduct marketing manager at juniper networks was asked nov   can you tell me how you would manage a new product launch  answeri would put together a launch plan with input from the necessary teams product management engineering testing support a part of the plan would include schedule key stakeholders and responsible team members and key deliverables and milestones with dates i would arrange weekly meetings leading up to the launch date and manage the progress on each of the milestones and deliverables by coordinating with each of the team membersproduct marketing manager at aruba networks was asked sep   tell me the thought process and planning as well as the execution in the launching a product x or creating a positioning for a productfeature y  answerstart with the target customer the use case and the differentiation of this productproduct marketing manager at hewlettpackard was asked apr   if germans were the tallest people in the world how would you prove it answersi first asked how would we define germans people who were born in germany people who lived in germany from east or west the food they ate had to do likely w  and stuff like thatmanpoorly constructed question we only have to prove it if germans are the tallest people in the world therefore if we are forced to prove it it must be the case that germans are actually the tallest people we could also randomly sample heights from people considered german and compare it to a random sampling of heights from people in nongerman groups we are interested in assuming we have resources to get large enough samples and can account for a variety of biases some anova and other stats stuff can get us the answerask yourself who you are supposed to prove it to the question was for a product marketing manager interview could it perhaps be that what they want is to see how you take something you know to be true you have to believe that the products you are trying to sell are great products to be a really great salesperson and convince everyone else of that factshow more responsestheres a lot of poorly defined stuff in here define germans include polish or french post wwii rapes define prove leave no doubt or is a statistical rejection of the null hypothesis acceptable and if so by what percentage define tallest include children under the age of i would check out the guinness book of world records and find out the nationality of the tallest person in the worldid probably say to the interviewer as long as no one can disprove that germans are the tallest people then you really dont have to prove anythinggermans were the tallest people in the world is a statement that is considered to be a statement that is made on basis of some statical analysis data point then thats the proof in given statement conclusion is made prior to the proofit would be an appropriate question if there was no if in a questiontake height measurements of a statistically significant sample of germans as well as all other groups to be considered if the average height of the german sample is the highest youve proven what was to be proveni can think of two different ways to get a quick insight into this  survey mcdonalds get them to count the heights of the first  people in the door on a given day then compare that information i havent done the confidence math on this  call the levi strauss company and ask them what distribution of pants they sell around the world bluejeans are sold just about everywhere so except for the possibility that leg length isnt an exact indicator of overall height i for example have short legs for my height they should be able to tell you how tall people are in any given country based on the pants they sell thereyou can prove that there is a statistically significant difference between  classes using a tailed students t test it just requires the average and standard deviation of each class instead of just giving up and saying we cant define who is german pick a definition of what a german is  take their average height and standard deviation and compare it to the average and standard deviation of the rest of the world using the tailed students t test or other similar statistical tests collecting height data may not be realistic for  person but if the interviewer asked you the question with no other stipulations then you can fill in the rest pretend you have unlimited resources just assume the data you need is known or can be looked up i think the interviewer wants to hear you think through a problem that displays youre creativity and resourcefulness just saying its not possible wont get you the jobim sorry  i feel uncomfortable with holocaust jokesother than measuring the height directly another possible solution is to use the side effects of taller people eg higher ceilings larger shoes or clothing or maybe its all in the dna anyway just call up an international retailer and ask if they make things bigger for germansshow more responsesi would answer with the following procedure  get the height of the shortest german  get the height of the tallest nongerman if the shortest german is taller than the tallest nongerman then this argument is true otherwise its falsedmv records or likewise entities are available all over the worldresearch engineer wrote pick a definition of what a german well if we are going to pick our own definition mine would be  everyone who is over  is german  everyone under  is not german qedi would look to the medical community cdc or ama possibly the unthe proposed answers seem rather convoluted you would have to prove it by statistics the statistics indicate that the dutch are the tallest people with an average height of  feet for men most of western and eastern europe have surpassed the united states in height due to the us fast food compulsion and inequitable health careif we already know that germans are the tallest people in the world then we dont have to prove itthis is a problem solving question  straight up pure and simple you take the question as a hypothesis and explain how you would go about proving the veracity of the statement if stats exist on the internet thats probably the fastest way to answer the question if there was time an money you could pay for secondary research if it exists or primary research the interviewer only wants to see how logical you are  not to actually solve the problem or question the thesis statementi have to agree driver licenses are a good source for height information httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedgather as large of a sample of german and nongerman heights employ a ttestztest to accept or reject the hypothesis at a given confidence intervalpull out my phone and access wwwguinnessworldrecordscom this one was easy hp needs to come up with more challenging questions if they are to prosper in  hps hr interviewer is now answering similar questions since being fired for lack of defining what he meant by a german tsk tskshow more responsestheir cars would be the biggest if they were indeed the tallestsorry assumptions cannot be proved but let me try to convince you this will strike some conversation just enough time for you to think on how to convince i am sure all this questions do not have a perfect answer they want to check your thought process patiencethe average length of mattress in germany is higher than the other countries then germans are the tallestbefore i do that how will the answer best help us solve our business challengesgermany has the largest number of stores that sell shoes in larger sizes inch and above and foot size is directly proportional to the height of personhence germans are proved to be the tallestif germans were the tallest people in the world i would have to prove it by determining what group is the tallest people in the worldno need  the dutch are the tallest apparentlyif you work with the definition that the country with the tallest median person are the tallest nation you can get to a solution algorithmically assumptions no multiple citizenships allowed median on an even number of persons is the one at positon n for simplicity we have lots of time to do this so we dont care about getting to a result quick  get everybody in a room  ask people to stand together by nations and form a line each  repeat for each line until nobody swaps  ask each person to swap with their right neighbour if that neighbour is shorter  for each line should be sorted by height now  ask the smallest and the largest person of each nation to leave  repeat until only one or two people are left  for each of the pairs left send the shorter one home  repeat until only one person is left  ask the remaining persons to form random pairs dont worry if one person is left standing alone  send all the shorter persons in each pair home  if the remainin person is german  you have proved iti would respond by saying that this is a profiling question and would prefer not to answerdmv records dont include heights in many countries of the world including germany which kind of puts the kibosh on this approach httpenwikipediaorgwikieuropeandrivinglicenceshow more responsesi think average height for adults is available from census or other survays per country now if you consider a person living in germany german citizenshipresidence vs nationality the highest number of your list should be germany theres the proofin the hypothetical world of the question it is a fact that the germans are the tallest a fact is a statement that can be proven so the fact was already proven at some point in the make believe world answer is a question how did the person who proved it before do itin science there is no absolute truth a hypothesis is not proven per se you can support your hypothesis with positive data but you can never really prove it scientifically conclusion your theory that germans are the tallest people can either be supported or negated but not provenuse arrest warrant or inmate records they do have height information because that is an identifying characteristic just like scars marks or tattoosjust check the most selled pant sizeby taking the average height into consideration of every country it would be proved that germans were tallest in the worldanalogy if ab how would you prove it answer i dont need to because you already said that abmeasure the height of the shortest doorway in a railway station or a common everyday place and compare to other nationsgermany is known for the automobile manufacturing giants like bmw etc just measure the the distance from the seat beneath to the rooftop above if it is greater than any other car manufactured then certainly an average germans height would account as the tallestsince in the qn they have used if i wud answer that how can i prove you right or wrong if you itself not sure about the factshow more responsestape measuredmv reporti would show the average height of germans compared to the average height of the rest of the worldlook upi would google itfirst you have to define your population then you have to establish a plan for your research what method are you going to use to gather data and also define your sampling plan the bigger the sample group the more reliable in market research there are several methods to analyze your data establishing your sampling procedure we can use deductive or inductive researchclassic puzzle question with aim to understand a persons thinking process and structure the interviewers original question drilldown approach or any of the statistical approaches are the only correct ways to answer such a problem solving question the others  like pant sizes shoe sizes  are interesting leading questions to lead to the solution you never simply answer such a case question without drilling down on the use cases first apparently the other responders either failed math  proofs are not anywhere near the product spectrum or are random trolls jumping on a hot question sadly they downvoted the best answer and the only one that probably would have passed the interviewproduct marketing manager at vmware was asked sep   who are our competitors answersthey have a lotmost notably parallels comes to mind but i think there may be one or two smaller playersmicrosoft citrix oraclesunshow more responsesditto experience interviewing with them for a similar positionthey did not bother even responding to mailsphone calls requesting for updateslearnt from an acquaintance over there that they had quietly moved on with another candidatehelps a lot if you have strong internal backinglack of professionalism is obviously loud and cleari would probably attribute it to arrogance for having quickly moved up the ranks as a successful silicon valley companyprincipal product marketing manager at atlassian was asked jul   if john locke from lost was

possible am i content to get there in one piece no matter how much time am i more interested in the journey this question is about thought processdirector product marketing at seagate technology was asked jun   what should our strategy be for xyz answeri find that companies use this question and others like it to be telltale signs that a company is using the interview process to get ideas or competitive information without ever hiring for the role ialways have to determine how to answer this as a true interview question without crossing the line into gift giving or a breach of confidentialityproduct marketing manager at hewlettpackard was asked jul   give me a search optimization plan for telecommunications service answeri was confused by the question because the service
