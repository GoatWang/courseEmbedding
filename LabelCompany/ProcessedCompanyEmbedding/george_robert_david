a september afternoon about  prominent christians assembled in the library of the metropolitan club on the east side of central park it was a gathering of unusual diversity and power many in attendance were conservative evangelicals like the bornagain watergate felon chuck colson who helped initiate the meeting metropolitan jonah the primate of the orthodox church in america was there as well and so were more than half a dozen of this country’s most influential roman catholic bishops including archbishop timothy dolan of new york archbishop john myers of newark and cardinal justin rigali of philadelphiaat the center of the event was robert p george a princeton university professor of jurisprudence and a roman catholic who is this country’s most influential conservative christian thinker dressed in his usual uniform of threepiece suit new college oxford cuff links and rimless glasses­ george convened the meeting with a note of thanks and a reminder of its purpose alarmed at the liberal takeover of washington and an apparent leadership vacuum among the christian right the group had come together to warn the country’s secular powers that the culture wars had not ended as a starting point george had drafted a word manifesto that promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion embryodestructive research or samesex marriagetwo months later at a washington press conference to present the group’s “manhattan declaration” george stepped aside to let cardinal rigali sum up just what made the statement and much of george’s work distinctive these principles did not belong to the christian faith alone the cardinal declared they rested on a foundation of universal reason “they are principles that can be known and honored by men and women of good will even apart from divine revelation” rigali said “they are principles of right reason and natural law”even marriage between a man and a woman rigali continued was grounded not just in religion and tradition but in logic “the true great goods of marriage — the unitive and the procreative goods — are inextricably bound together such that the complementarity of husband and wife is of the very essence of marital communion” the cardinal continued ascending into philosophical abstractions surely lost on most in the room “sexual relations outside the marital bond are contrary not only to the will of god but to the good of man indeed they are contrary to the will of god precisely because they are against the good of man” advertisement continue reading the main story george looked on with arms crossed and lips sealed but he was obviously pleased to anyone who knew george’s work the cardinal’s words sounded very much as if george had written them and when i asked him about it later he acknowledged providing assistance rigali’s remarks were a summation of the distinctive moral philosophy that is the foundation of george’s power continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story he has parlayed a thcentury catholic philosophy into real political influence glenn beck the fox news talker and a big george fan likes to introduce him as “one of the biggest brains in america” or on one broadcast “superman of the earth” karl rove told me he considers george a rising star on the right and a leading voice in persuading president george w bush to restrict embryonic stemcell research supreme court justice antonin scalia told me he numbers george among the mosttalkedabout thinkers in conservative legal circles and newt gingrich called him “an important and growing influence” on the conservative movement especially on matters like abortion and marriage“if there really is a vast rightwing conspiracy” the conservative catholic journal crisis concluded a few years ago “its leaders probably meet in george’s kitchen”for  years george has operated largely out of public view at the intersection of academia religion and politics in the past  months however he has stepped into a more prominent role with the death of the rev richard john neuhaus a lutheran minister turned roman catholic priest who helped bring evangelicals and catholics together into a political movement george has assumed his mantle as the reigning brain of the christian right and he is in many ways the public face of the conservative side in the most urgent culturewar battle of the day the national organization for marriage the advocacy group fighting samesex marriage in albany and trenton maine and california has made him its chairman before the  election he helped a coalition of christian conservative groups write their proposed amendment to the federal constitution defining marriage as heterosexual more than any other scholar george has staked his reputation on the claim that samesex marriage violates not only tradition but also human reasonit’s part of a philosophy that has found support among a group of catholic bishops who have become some of the most persistent critics of president obama and the congressional democrats george serves as their intellectual point man in the past few years many of the evangelical protestants who once defined the religious right have turned inward after their disappointment with president george w bush in their place george’s friends among the catholic bishops have stepped to the fore hammering obama for his prochoice catholic cabinet nominees for being invited to speak at notre dame’s commencement for his stemcell research policies and most recently for his health care proposalsas democrats have stepped up their explicitly religious appeals to catholic voters these bishops have pushed back against the intrusion on their turf while democrats talked of finding common ground on abortion archbishop charles chaput of denver the informal leader of this side of the american church gave a muchpublicized speech denouncing obama as “the most committed abortion rights candidate in history” chaput chose to publish his remarks on the web site of a think tank cofounded by george — the man who had himself argued in an essay disseminated widely last fall through conservative circles fox news and christian radio that barack obama was “the most extreme proabortion candidate ever to seek” the presidencygeorge’s role as an adviser to these bishops began more than  years ago when he was a young professor and recent phd a mutual friend introduced him to the rev john myers then a bishop in peoria ill who was working on a pastoral letter about the moral obligations of catholic voters and politicians with george’s assistance myers wrote a letter laying out the case that abortion as the taking of a life was a crime against the natural law of human reason not merely a violation of catholic theology therefore myers and george argued catholic politicians and voters were wrong to write off the church’s teachings as a matter of personal faith what’s more the letter warned voting for a candidate or a law upholding abortion rights would almost invariably put a catholic so far outside church teachings that he should not receive communion as the first systematic rebuttal to mario cuomo and other catholic politicians who support abortion rights the letter kicked off a nowfamiliar debate inside the church “whenever i venture out into the public square i would almost invariably check it out with robby first” myers now the archbishop of newark told me many of the bishops myers says rely on george as “a touchstone” and “the preeminent catholic intellectual”last spring george was invited to address an audience that included many bishops at a conference in washington he told them with typical bluntness that they should stop talking so much about the many policy issues they have taken up in the name of social justice they should concentrate their authority on “the moral social” issues like abortion embryonic stemcell research and samesex marriage where he argued the natural law and gospel principles were clear to be sure he said he had no objections to bishops “making utter nuisances of themselves” about poverty and injustice like the old testament prophets as long as they did not advocate specific remedies they should stop lobbying for detailed economic policies like progressive tax rates higher minimum wage and presumably the expansion of health care — “matters of public policy upon which gospel principles by themselves do not resolve differences of opinion among reasonable and wellinformed people of good will” as george put it advertisement continue reading the main story a few months later in a july  letter to congress the bishops did something close to that in the health care debate setting aside decades of calls for universal coverage the bishops pledged to fight any bill that failed to block the use of federal subsidies for insurance covering abortion “stalin famously asked ‘how many divisions has the pope’ ” george wrote to me in an email message after house speaker nancy pelosi allowed a vote on an amendment that satisfied the bishops’ demands “i guess pelosi now knows”in the american culture wars george wants to redraw the lines it is the liberals he argues who are slaves to a faithbased “secularist orthodoxy” of “feminism multiculturalism gay liberationism and lifestyle liberalism” conservatives in contrast speak from the high ground of nonsectarian public reason george is the leading voice for a group of catholic scholars known as the new natural lawyers he argues for the enforcement of a moral code as strictly traditional as that of a religious fundamentalist what makes his natural law “new” is that it disavows dependence on divine revelation or biblical scripture — or even history and anthropology instead george rests his ethics on a foundation of “practical reason” “invoking no authority beyond the authority of reason itself” as he put it in one essaygeorge’s admirers say he is revitalizing a strain of catholic naturallaw thinking that goes back to st thomas aquinas his scholarship has earned him accolades from religious and secular institutions alike in one notable week two years ago he received invitations to deliver prestigious lectures at the southern baptist theological seminary and harvard law school his critics including many of his fellow catholic scholars argue that he is turning the church into a tool of republican party they say he is too focused on the mechanics of sex and morality neglecting the other sides of the christian message the corruption of human reason through original sin the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption citing george’s comparison of catholic scholars who support abortion rights to defenders of chattel slavery cathleen kaveny of the notre dame law school another scholar of law and theology in the thomistic tradition has called george and his allies “rambo catholics” and “ecclesiastical bullies”i met george  years ago when i was a prince­ton student and he was praying for tenure the next time i saw him was in  when he invited me back for a postelection conference on the future of the conservative movement rove spoke at lunch to a movement still stinging from decades of condescension george brings gleaming ivory tower credentials degrees in law and theology from harvard a doctorate in philosophy of law from oxford a supreme court fellowship and the endowed chair at princeton that woodrow wilson once heldin late august i returned to princeton where george was striding around a seminar room at the princeton theological seminary — “john paul ii style” as he put it a reference to the pontiff’s habit of strolling as he spoke at  george has thick graybrown hair bright blue eyes and a certain boyishness seemingly everyone from rove to cardinal rigali calls him simply robby a few dozen graduate and starundergraduate students had traveled from as far away as cambridge and poland for a seminar on the new natural law he is by all accounts a terrific teacher “awesome” several undergraduates said in a stack of glowing evaluations he showed me part of the reason may be that he brings almost every philosophical question back to a central debate about the nature of the self a battle between reason and the passions moral philosophy as george describes it is a contest between the greek philosopher aristotle and the scottish enlightenment thinker david humearistotelians like st thomas aquinas hold that there is an objective moral order human reason can see it and we have the free will to follow or not “in a wellordered soul reason’s got the whip hand over emotion” george told the seminar in a favorite formulation borrowed from plato humeans — and in george’s view modern liberals are usually humeans — disagree against aristotle hume argued that the universe includes facts but not values you cannot derive moral conclusions from studying the world an “ought” from an “is” there is no builtin objective reason for me to choose one goal over another — the goals of mother teresa over the goals of adolf hitler in george’s hypothetical reason then is merely a tool of whatever desire strikes my fancy “reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and may pretend to no office other than to serve and obey them” george said paraphrasing hume just as he does in seemingly every essay or lecture he writesin georges view if i have no rational basis for picking one goal over another then i have no free choice only predetermined “passions” — the result of genetics a blow to the head whatever made me prefer either curing the sick or killing the jews we have reason and free choice he teaches or we have amorality and determinismgeorge’s thinking draws on a system of ethics first developed against the backdrop of the s debate inside the catholic church over contraception in the tradition of aquinas catholic thinkers had for centuries tried to establish moral laws of nature by studying biology anthropology and history when it came to sex the church taught the idea of a “perverted faculty” sex was intended for the dual purpose of procreation and marital unity so deliberate ejaculation in any other context — oral or anal sex artificial contraception masturbation premarital sex adultery — demeaned sex and contravened the natural law female orgasms incidental to conception were not an issue advertisement continue reading the main story but by the late s most secular philosophers had abandoned the project of finding moral norms in nature amid the openness of the second vatican council some of their catholic counterparts began to wonder if they should give up too then came the pill some catholic scholars all the way up to the level of papal advisers questioned whether a form of birth control that did not put a physical barrier between the partners might be permissible some began to suggest that the church should shift its focus from the act of sex to the totality of marriage as protestants did and stop worrying as much about ejaculation and contraception wasn’t it marital love that was meant to be fruitful and that gave sex its meaningan orthodoxminded georgetown university philosopher named germain grisez mounted a novel defense of the birthcontrol ban instead of beginning with science or history he started by listing certain basic human goods that he believed anyone could see were “integral to human flourishing” like friendship knowledge excellence in work and play religion life and procreation each was an end in itself not a means to anything else you could never prove each’s value by referring to other values — only assert and defend each one on its owngrisez argued that contraception violated the “basic good” of “the handing on of new life” for george and the new natural lawyers grisez’s tactic of starting from selfevident human goods gave “the whip hand” back to reason photo point man robert p george receiving the presidential citizens medal in december  credit chris greenberggeorge w bush presidential library in practice george and his allies have usually found the rules of sexuality quite absolute while the church’s teachings about social justice come out more contingent that may be why he is almost uniformly popular among evangelicals but controversial among many of his fellow catholics particularly those who prefer the churchs peaceandjustice liberalism to its conservative bioethicson the question of capital punishment george says he is against it but he considers it a matter of interpretation about which catholics can disagree the intentional killing of innocent civilians in war is as grave a moral crime as abortion george says but what constitutes a “just war” is a more complicated judgment call before the  invasion of iraq he wrote an oped article in the wall street journal arguing that the attack was not necessarily unjust and might even be a moral obligation “on the evidence that hillary clinton voted for the war on and george bush went to war on i thought it was justified” he told methe “rights” to education and health care are another matter george told his seminar “who is supposed to provide education or health care to whom” george asked “health care and education are things that you have to pay for resources are always finite” he went on “is it better for education and health care to be provided by governments under socialized systems or by private providers in markets or by some combination” those questions george said “go beyond the application of moral principles you can get all the moral principles dead right and not have an answer to any of those questions” newsletter sign up continue

“straightforward” george told me several times in his most recent book “embryo” written with christopher tollefsen george tells the story of noah benton markham rescued from hurricane katrina by a team of policemen in boats noah was an embryo frozen in liquid nitrogen on a hospital shelf later implanted in the womb of his biological mother he will turn  next month science shows that you remain the same human with the same dna as a teenager a toddler and an embryo george argues the only moral debate he says is whether you deserve legal protection at each stage of your lifegeorge grew up in morgantown wva the oldest of five brothers all served as altar boys four attended oxford and became lawyers his father was a liquor broker and george is a wine connoisseur his mother the daughter of italian immigrants taught her children “some pretty firm ideas about sexual morality” george told me and then he begged me not to repeat some of his more recent arguments on the subject “mom i have got to explain” george said raising his voice to imitate first himself and then his mother “ ‘george’s opposition to sodomy what are you doing talking about sodomy you shouldn’t even know what that is why do people have to know your views about that’“the roman stoic musonius rufus said look there are some things you just shouldn’t have to talk about and i think sex is one” george said “but in the circumstances we are in what can you do i can’t possibly make the case — to people on my own side or on the other side — about what i think marriage is and why it is so important unless we get into the earthy stuff” advertisement continue reading the main story the samesex marriage debate george argues illuminates an error in our understanding that he blames for most of the ills afflicting modern marriage — infidelity divorce outofwedlock births marriage is not just for procreation love or sexual pleasure “people have lost their grip on the true reasons for marrying so they are unwilling to make all the sacrifices real marriage requires” he saidhe admits the argument for marriage between a man and a woman can require “somewhat technical philosophical analysis” it is a twostep case that starts with marriage and works its way back to sex first he contends that marriage is a uniquely “comprehensive” union meaning that it is shared at several different levels at once — emotional spiritual and bodily “and the really interesting evidence that it is comprehensive is that it is anchored in bodily sharing” he says“ordinary friendships wouldn’t be friendships anymore if they involved bodily sharing” he explained to me “if i despite being a married man had this female friend of mine and i said ‘well gosh why don’t we do some bodily sharing’ and we had straightforward sexual intercourse well that wouldn’t be friendship or marriage it is bodily ok but it is not part of a comprehensive sharing of life my comprehensive sharing of life is with my wife which i just now violated” but just as friendships with sex are not friendships marriage without sex is not marriage sex george said is the key to this “comprehensive unity” he then imagined himself as a man with no interest in sex who proposed to seal a romance by committing to play tennis only with his beloved breaking that promise he said would not be adulterythe second step is more complicated and more graphic george argues that only vaginal intercourse — “procreativetype” sex acts as george puts it — can consummate this “multilevel” mindbody union only in reproduction unlike digestion circulation respiration or any other bodily function do two individuals perform a single function and thus become in effect “one organism” each oppositesex partner is incomplete for the task yet together they create a “oneflesh union” in the language of scripture “their bodies become one they are biologically united and do not merely rub together in coitus and only in coitus similarly to the way in which one’s heart lungs and other organs form a unity by coordinating for the biological good of the whole” george writes in a draft of his latest essay on the subject unloving sex between married partners does not perform the same multilevel function he argues nor does oral or anal sex — even between loving spousesinfertile couples too are performing this uniquely shared reproductive function george says even if they know their sperm and ovum cannot complete it marriage is designed in part for procreation in the way a baseball team is designed for winning games he says but “people who can practice baseball can be teammates without victories on the field”george argues that reason alone shows that heterosexual sodomy and homosexual sex are morally wrong just as the catholic church classical philosophers and other religious traditions have historically taught unlike marital union in his special sense he contends such acts treat the body as an instrument of the mind’s pleasure as both a practical and a philosophical matter he argues the law should not necessarily police such things but the need for the state to establish a proper definition of marriage is a different matter he says because the law has always regulated it in the interest of parenthood and community “marriage in principle is a public institution” he said “i don’t think it can be like bar mitzvahs or baptisms or the elks club”it is safe to say that not many contemporary philosophers — whether secular or catholic — agree with george’s marriage argument many balk at the mystical “unitive and procreative” qualities george ascribes to sexual intercourse the idea of “one flesh” union seems far less obviously intelligible than other “basic goods” like friendship knowledge or religion even fellow catholic thomists who oppose samesex marriage question the esoteric quality of george’s argument why not just begin with the fact that humans are sexual and ask how best to channel that sexuality liberals on the other hand generally argue that the meaning of marriage is in the partners’ love not their loins to which george counters that they offer no definition that would exclude polygamygeorge once won two terms as governor of the west virginia democratic youth conference in high school and even served as an alternate delegate to the  democratic convention he moved right in the s initially over the issue of abortion which eventually took him back to politics on the day of the pennsylvania primary in the  presidential campaign bob casey then the state’s governor and the father of the current senator casey surprised george with a phone call to talk about george’s criticisms of mario cuomo later that year when bill clinton denied casey a chance to speak about abortion at the  democratic convention it was george who had helped to write casey’s speech two years later george represented mother teresa before the supreme court in an amicus brief seeking the overturning of roe v wade when george w bush became president in  george was an active player in weekly white house conference calls for catholic allies bush later awarded george a presidential citizens medal during the  campaign rudy giuliani mitt romney and john mccain each sought george’s counsel advertisement continue reading the main story at princeton george founded an independently financed center the james madison program in american ideals and institutions conservatives celebrate it for bringing conservative thinking to the campus and for adding “princeton” to the résumés of young scholars in the decade since its founding george has helped scholars and foundations use it as a template for similar outfits at georgetown new york university and williams college last spring he joined a group of undergraduates in their call for a new university center for chastity and abstinence he suggested they might have better luck with the name “center for love and fidelity”george’s leftleaning colleagues say he is unfailingly polite and even helpful he coteaches­ a greatbooks seminar with the africanamerican scholar cornel west who told me he thinks of george as “just a nice brother” george and his wife cindy who is jewish socialize with liberal professors but his relationships with other catholic scholars are sometimes more contentious especially about politicsshortly after the last presidential election john haldane an eminent thomist who is a friend of george’s and an adviser to the vatican sent an open “letter to america” to a web site of the witherspoon institute a conservative think tank that george helped found citing issues like the iraq war and the wall street debacle haldane argued that obama won in part because american voters “took moral exception to some of the policies pursued by the bush administration and i believe that in this their judgment was correct”haldane an orthodox catholic opponent of abortion and samesex marriage argued that his fellow “moral conservatives” like george risked their own credibility if they continued attacking obama as morally inferior when i reached him by phone in scotland where he lives haldane told me that he could not have recommended voting for either candidate in america’s  election “if you were going to vote for john mccain how are you going to square that with these discussions about social justice — about the running sore of structural deprivation running through american society or the prosecution of an unjust war” he asked “there has been a tendency of social conservatives to either hold their noses because they are more concerned about abortion or just not to notice the smell”when i asked george about the letter he was derisive “john thanks for the advice” he said sarcastically “gosh i wish we would have taken it we would have the strong and vibrant social conservative movement that you guys have in great britain”george instead is plunging deeper into partisan politics alarmed at signs that the republican party was moving away from cultural issues he recently founded a new group called the american principles project which aims to build a grassroots movement around his ideas “his new venture will make him a major political player” the conservative writer fred barnes predicted in the weekly standard among the group’s first endeavors has been to call for the ouster of kevin jennings an obama education official who previously founded the gay lesbian and straight education network jennings george says wants to “use our elementary schools in defiance of the wishes of parents to use our elementary schools to teach prosexualliberationist prohomosexualist propaganda”i asked george several times if he was really hoping to ground a mass movement in abstract principles of reason so at odds with the prevailing culture it was a bet he said on his conviction about the innate human gift for reason still he said if there was one critique of his work that worried him it was the charge that he puts too much faith in the power of reason overlooking what christians describe as original sin and what secular pessimists call historyit is a debate at least as old as the reformation when martin luther broke with the catholic church and insisted that reason was so corrupted that faith in the divine was humanity’s only hope of salvation until relatively recently contemporary evangelicals routinely leveled the same charge at modern catholics “this is a serious issue and if i am wrong this is where i am wrong” george acknowledgesover lunch last month at the princeton faculty club george noted that many evangelicals had signed the manhattan declaration despite the traditional protestant skepticism about the corruption of human reason “i sold my view about reason” he declared he was especially pleased that by signing onto the text so many catholic bishops had endorsed his new naturallaw argument about marriage “it really is the top leadership of the american church” he said advertisement continue reading the main story “obviously i am gratified that view appears to have attracted a very strong following among the bishops” he went on “i just hope i am right if they are going to buy my arguments i don’t want to mislead the whole church” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related
