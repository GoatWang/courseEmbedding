mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

insurance policy our administrative procedures may vary depending on the state in which your contract is delivered portfolio optimization the service portfolio optimization is an asset allocation service that is offered at no additional charge for use within this variable annuity asset allocation refers to the manner that investments are distributed among asset classes to help attain an investment goal for your variable annuity portfolio optimization can help with decisions about how you should allocate your contract value among available investment options the theory behind portfolio optimization is that diversification among asset classes can help reduce volatility over the long term as part of the portfolio optimization service several asset allocation models have been developed “portfolio optimization models” or “models” each based on different profiles of an investor’s willingness to accept investment risk if you decide to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service and select one of the portfolio optimization models your initial purchase payment in the case of a new application or contract value as applicable will be allocated to the investment options according to the model you select subsequent purchase payments if allowed under your contract will also be allocated accordingly unless you instruct us otherwise if you choose you can rebalance your contract value quarterly semiannually or annually to maintain the current allocations of your portfolio optimization model since changes in the net asset values of the underlying portfolios within each model will alter your asset allocation over time if you also allocate part of your purchase payment or contract value that is not currently included in your model and you elect periodic rebalancing such amounts will not be considered when rebalancing if you subscribe to portfolio optimization and elect periodic rebalancing only the investment options within your model will be rebalanced if you subscribe to portfolio optimization pacific life fund advisors llc adviser a subsidiary of pacific life will serve as your investment adviser for the service solely for purposes of development of the portfolio optimization models and periodic updates of the models on a periodic basis typically annually the portfolio optimization models are evaluated and the models are updated as discussed below if you subscribe to portfolio optimization your contract value or subsequent purchase payments as applicable will automatically be reallocated in accordance with the model you select as it is updated from time to time based on discretionary authority that you grant to the adviser unless you instruct otherwise for more information on the role of the investment adviser for the portfolio optimization service please see the brochure from the adviser’s form adv the sec investment adviser registration form which will be delivered to contract owners at the time they apply for a contract please contact us if you would like to receive a copy of this brochure in developing and periodically updating the portfolio optimization models the adviser currently relies on the recommendations of an independent thirdparty analytical firm the adviser may change the firm that it uses from time to time or to the extent permissible under applicable law use no independent firm at all the portfolio optimization models five asset allocation models are offered each comprised of a carefully selected combination of investment options reflecting the underlying portfolios of pacific select fund development of the portfolio optimization models is a multistep process first an optimization analysis is performed to determine the breakdown of asset classes optimization analysis requires forecasting returns standard deviations and correlation coefficients of asset classes over the desired investing horizon and an analysis using a stateofthe art program and a statistical analytical technique known as “meanvariance optimization” next after the asset class exposures are known a determination is made of how available investment options underlying portfolios can be used to implement the asset class level allocations the investment options are selected by evaluating the asset classes represented by the underlying portfolios and combining investment options to arrive at the desired asset class exposures the portfoliospecific analysis uses historical returnsbased style analysis and asset performance and regression and attribution analyses it may also include portfolio manager interviews based on this analysis investment options are selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model given a particular level of risk tolerance this process could in some cases result in the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset class exposure or other specific optimization factors even where another investment option may have better historical performance periodic updates of the portfolio optimization model and notices of updates each of the portfolio optimization models are evaluated periodically generally annually to assess whether the combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended for the model as a result of the periodic analysis each model may change and investment options may be added to a model including investment options not currently available or investment options may be deleted from a model    table of contents when your portfolio optimization model is updated your contract value and subsequent purchase payments if applicable will automatically be reallocated in accordance with any changes to the model you have selected this means the allocation of your contract value and potentially the investment options in which you are invested will automatically change and your contract value and subsequent purchase payments if applicable will automatically be reallocated among the investment options in your updated model independently of any automatic rebalancing you may have selected the adviser requires that you grant it discretionary investment authority to periodically reallocate your contract value and subsequent purchase payments if applicable in accordance with the updated version of the portfolio optimization model you have selected if you wish to participate in portfolio optimization when the adviser updates the portfolio optimizations models a written notice of the updated models will be sent to participants at least  days in advance of the date the adviser intends the updated version of the model to be effective you should carefully review these notices if you wish to accept the changes in your selected model you will not need to take any action as your contract value or subsequent purchase payments if applicable will automatically be reallocated in accordance with the updated model if you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model you can change to a different model or withdraw from the portfolio optimization service selecting a portfolio optimization model if you choose to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service you need to determine which portfolio optimization model is best for you neither the adviser nor its affiliates will make this decision you should consult with your registered representative on this decision your registered representative can help you determine which model is best suited to your financial needs investment time horizon and willingness to accept investment risk you should periodically review these factors with your registered representative to determine if you should change models to keep up with changes in your personal circumstances your registered representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service or to change to a different model you may in consultation with your registered representative utilize analytical tools made available by the adviser including an investor profile questionnaire which asks questions intended to help you or your registered representative assess your financial needs investment time horizon and willingness to accept investment risk your responses can be analyzed using the service available on our website while the information from our website may assist you it is your decision in consultation with your registered representative to select a model or to change to a different model and the adviser and its affiliates bear no responsibility for this decision you may change to a different model at any time subject to transfer and market timing restrictions with a proper written request or by telephone or electronic instructions provided a valid telephoneelectronic authorization is on file with us periodic reports participants in the portfolio optimization service will periodically be sent performance information regarding the investment options within a selected model this information may also be accessed online information concerning the current models is described below risks although the models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility investment performance of your contract value could be better or worse by participating in a portfolio optimization model than if you had not participated a model may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or other combinations of investment options or asset classes model performance is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options and their underlying portfolios the timing of your investment and the frequency of automatic rebalancing may affect performance your contract value will fluctuate and when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost a portfolio optimization model may not perform as intended although the models are intended to optimize returns given various levels of risk tolerance portfolio market and asset class performance may differ in the future from the historical performance and assumptions upon which the models are based which could cause the models to be ineffective or less effective in reducing volatility periodic updating of the portfolio optimization models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur transactional expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios these expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models the adviser may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence its decision making with regard to portfolio optimization for example one portfolio may provide a higher advisory fee to the adviser than another portfolio and provide the adviser with incentive to use the portfolio with the higher fee as part of a portfolio optimization model in addition the adviser may believe that certain portfolios may benefit from additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions as adviser to pacific select fund the adviser monitors the portfolios and may from time to time recommend to the pacific select fund’s board of trustees a change in portfolio management firm or strategy or the closure or merger of a portfolio all of which could impact a model all pacific select fund portfolios except those expected to be liquidated or    table of contents merged are analyzed by the independent third party analytical firm the third party analytical firm determines the number of portfolios in a model the percent that any portfolio represents in a model and which portfolios may be selected the adviser will work with the analytical firm to resolve any investment related matters derived from the analytical firm’s recommendations the adviser believes that its reliance on the recommendations of an independent thirdparty analytical firm to develop and update the models as described above reduces or eliminates the potential for the adviser to be influenced by these competing interests but there can be no assurance of this the adviser and its affiliates are under no contractual obligation to continue this service and have the right to terminate or change the portfolio optimization service at any time    table of contents the models information concerning the

contents investing in variable investment options each time you allocate your investment to a variable investment option your contract is credited with a number of “subaccount units” in that subaccount the number of subaccount units credited is equal to the amount you have allocated to that subaccount divided by the “unit value” of one unit of that subaccount   example you allocate  to the inflation managed subaccount at the end of the business day on which your allocation is effective the value of one unit in the inflation managed subaccount is  as a result  subaccount units are credited to your contract for your     your variable account value will change after we credit your contract with subaccount units the value of those units will usually fluctuate this means that from time to time your investment allocated to the variable investment options may be worth more or less than the original investments to which those amounts can be attributed fluctuations in subaccount unit value will not change the number of units credited to your contract subaccount unit values will vary in accordance with the investment performance of the corresponding portfolio for example the value of units in the managed bond subaccount will change to reflect the performance of the managed bond portfolio including that portfolio’s investment income its capital gains and losses and its expenses subaccount unit values are also adjusted to reflect the administrative fee and applicable risk charge imposed on the separate account we calculate the value of all subaccount units on each business day calculating subaccount unit values we calculate the unit value of the subaccount units in each variable investment option at the close of the new york stock exchange which usually closes at  pm eastern time on each business day at the end of each business day the unit value for a subaccount is equal to y × z               where   y      the unit value for that subaccount as of the end of the preceding business day and     z      the net investment factor for that subaccount for the period a “valuation period” between that business day and the immediately preceding business day the “net investment factor” for a subaccount for any valuation period is equal to a ÷ b  c               where   a      the “per share value of the assets” of that subaccount as of the end of that valuation period which is equal to abc               where   a      the net asset value per share of the corresponding portfolio shares held by that subaccount as of the end of that valuation period     b      the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distributions made by each fund for that portfolio during that valuation period and     c      any per share charge a negative number or credit a positive number for any income taxes andor any other taxes or other amounts set aside during that valuation period as a reserve for any income andor any other taxes which we determine to have resulted from the operations of the subaccount or contract andor any taxes attributable directly or indirectly to investments                   b      the net asset value per share of the corresponding portfolio shares held by the subaccount as of the end of the preceding valuation period and     c      a factor that assesses against the subaccount net assets for each calendar day in the valuation period the basic risk charge plus any applicable increase in the risk charge and the administrative fee see the charges fees and deductions section in this prospectus    table of contents when your investment is effective your initial investment is effective on the day we issue your contract any additional investment is effective on the day we receive it in proper form see the additional information— inquiries and submitting forms and requests section in this prospectus the day your investment is effective determines the unit value at which subaccount units are attributed to your contract in the case of transfers or withdrawals the effective day determines the unit value at which affected subaccount units are debited andor credited under your contract that unit value is the value of the subaccount units next calculated after your transaction is effective your variable account value begins to reflect the investment performance results of your new allocations on the day after your transaction is effective transfers and market–timing restrictions transfers transfers are allowed  days after the contract date currently we are not enforcing this restriction but we reserve the right to enforce it in the future once your investments are allocated to the investment options you selected you may transfer your account value less loan account value from any investment option to any other investment option transfers are limited to  for each calendar year only  transfers in any calendar month may involve any of the following investment options international value international smallcap international largecap or emerging markets in addition only  transfers into or out of the american funds growth or american funds growthincome investment options may occur in any calendar month transfers to or from a variable investment option cannot be made before the seventh calendar day following the last transfer to or from the same variable investment option if the seventh calendar day is not a business day then a transfer may not occur until the next business day the day of the last transfer is not considered a calendar day for purposes of meeting this requirement for example if you make a transfer into the diversified research variable investment option on monday you may not make any transfers to or from that variable investment option before the following monday transfers to or from the money market variable investment option are excluded from this limitation for the purpose of applying the limitations multiple transfers that occur on the same day are considered  transfer a transfer of account value from the loan account back into your investment options following a loan repayment is not considered a transfer under these limitations transfers that occur as a result of the dollar cost averaging program the portfolio rebalancing program the earnings sweep program approved corporate owned life insurance policy rebalancing programs or an approved asset allocation service are excluded from these limitations also allocations of purchase payments are not subject to these limitations if you have used all  transfers available to you in a calendar year you may no longer make transfers between the investment options until the start of the next calendar year however you may make  transfer of all or a portion of the account value remaining in the variable investment options into the money market investment option prior to the start of the next calendar year there are no exceptions to the above transfer limitations in the absence of an error by us a substitution of investment options or reorganization of underlying portfolios or other extraordinary circumstances if we deny a transfer request we will notify your registered representative via telephone if you or your registered representative request a transfer via telephone that exceeds the above limitations we will notify you or your registered representative immediately certain restrictions apply to any available fixed option see the general account section in this prospectus transfer requests are generally effective on the business day we receive them in proper form unless you request a date in the future or a systematic transfer program we have the right at our option unless otherwise required by law to require certain minimums in the future in connection with transfers these may include a minimum transfer amount and a minimum account value if any for the investment option from which the transfer is made or to which the transfer is made if your transfer request results in your having a remaining account value in an investment option that is less than  immediately after such transfer we may transfer that account value to your other investment options on a pro rata basis relative to your most recent allocation instructions we reserve the right unless otherwise required by law to limit the size of transfers to restrict transfers to require that you submit any transfer requests in writing to suspend transfers and to impose further limits on the number and frequency of    table of contents transfers you can make we also reserve the right to reject any transfer request any policy we may establish with regard to the exercise of any of these rights will be applied uniformly to all contract owners markettiming restrictions the contract is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to shortterm fluctuations in the market accordingly organizations or individuals that use markettiming investment strategies and make frequent transfers should not purchase the contract such frequent trading can disrupt management of the underlying portfolios and raise expenses the transfer limitations set forth above are intended to reduce frequent trading in addition we monitor certain large transaction activity in an attempt to detect trading that may be disruptive to the portfolios in the event transfer activity is found to be disruptive certain future transactions by such contract owners or by a registered representative or other party acting on behalf of one or more contract owners will require preclearance frequent trading and large transactions that are disruptive to portfolio management can have an adverse effect on portfolio performance and therefore your contract’s performance such trading may also cause dilution in the value of the investment options held by longterm contract owners while these issues can occur in connection with any of the underlying portfolios portfolios holding securities that are subject to market pricing inefficiencies are more susceptible to abuse for example portfolios holding international securities may be more susceptible to timezone arbitrage which seeks to take advantage of pricing discrepancies occurring between the time of the closing of the market on which the security is traded and the time of pricing of the portfolios our policies and procedures which limit the number and frequency of transfers and which may impose preclearance requirements on certain large transactions are applied uniformly to all contract owners however there is a risk that these policies and procedures will not detect all potentially disruptive activity or will otherwise prove ineffective in whole or in part further we and our affiliates make available to our variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners underlying funds not affiliated with us we are unable to monitor or restrict the trading activity with respect to shares of such funds not sold in connection with our contracts in the event the board of trusteesdirectors of any underlying fund imposes a redemption fee or trading transfer limitations we will pass them on to you we reserve the right to restrict in our sole discretion and without prior notice transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions on behalf of multiple contract owners such restrictions could include   •  not accepting transfer instructions from a registered representative acting on behalf of more than one contract owner and     •  not accepting preauthorized transfer forms from market timers or other entities acting on behalf of more than one contract owner at a time we further reserve the right to impose without prior notice restrictions on transfers that we determine in our sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other contract owners or to comply with any applicable federal and state laws rules and regulations exchanges of annuity units exchanges of annuity units in any subaccounts to any other subaccounts after the annuity date are limited to  in any month period see the general account section in the prospectus and the contracts and the separate account section in the sai systematic transfer options we offer  systematic transfer options dollar cost averaging portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweep there is no charge for these options and transfers under these options are not counted towards your total transfers in a calendar year however they are subject to the same requirements and restrictions as nonsystematic transfers you can have only one dollar cost averaging or earnings sweep program in effect at one time the systematic transfer options are not available after you annuitize dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging is a method in which you buy securities in a series of regular purchases instead of in a single purchase this allows you to average the securities’ prices over time and may permit a “smoothing” of abrupt peaks and drops in price prior to your annuity date you may use dollar cost averaging to transfer amounts over time from any investment option with an account value of at least  to one or more variable investment options each transfer must be for at least     table of contents currently we are not enforcing the minimum account value andor transfer amounts but we reserve the right to enforce such minimum amounts in the future transfers from the fixed option under the dollar cost averaging program are subject to a minimum duration of  months detailed information appears in the sai portfolio rebalancing you may instruct us to maintain a specific balance of variable investment options under your contract eg  in the equity index subaccount  in the managed bond subaccount and  in the growth lt subaccount prior to your annuity date periodically we will “rebalance” your values in the elected subaccounts to the percentages you have specified rebalancing may result in transferring amounts from a subaccount earning a relatively higher return to one earning a relatively lower return you may choose to have rebalances made quarterly semiannually or annually until your annuity date portfolio rebalancing is not available after you annuitize only variable investment options are available for rebalancing detailed information appears in the sai earnings sweep you may instruct us to make automatic periodic transfers of your earnings from the money market subaccount or from the fixed option to one or more variable investment options other than the money market subaccount detailed information appears in the sai charges fees and deductions withdrawal charge no sales charge is

depends on how long each purchase payment was held under your contract each purchase payment you make is considered to have a certain “age” depending on the length of time since that purchase payment was effective a purchase payment is “one year old” or has an “age of one” from the day it is effective until the beginning of the day preceding your next contract anniversary beginning on the day preceding that contract anniversary your purchase payment will have an “age of two” and increases in age on the day preceding each contract anniversary when    table of contents you withdraw an amount subject to the withdrawal charge the “age” of the purchase payment you withdraw determines the level of withdrawal charge as follows           withdrawal charge as a percentage “age” of payment of the purchase in years payments withdrawn                                     or more       we calculate your withdrawal charge by assuming that amounts withdrawn are attributed to purchase payments first and in the order your purchase payments were received by us then earnings and before any deductions for other charges due or taxes are made the withdrawal charge will be deducted proportionately among all investment options from which the withdrawal occurs unless you specify otherwise a partial withdrawal amount requested will be processed as a “gross” amount which means that applicable charges and taxes will be deducted from the requested amount if a partial withdrawal amount is requested to be a “net” amount applicable charges and taxes will be added to the requested amount and the withdrawal charges and taxes will be calculated on the grossed up amount example you make an initial purchase payment of  in contract year  and make an additional purchase payment of  in contract year  with earnings your contract value in contract year  is  in contract year  you make a withdrawal of  at this point total purchase payments equal  earnings equal  and the “age” of the applicable purchase payments withdrawn is  years  of all remaining purchase payments made  may be withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge per contract year the amount of the withdrawal charge applied would be    the withdrawal charge is designed to reimburse us for sales commissions and other expenses associated with the promotion and solicitation of offers for the contracts although our actual expenses may be greater or less than the amount of the withdrawal charge see the additional information— distribution arrangements section in this prospectus for information regarding commissions and other amounts paid to brokerdealers in connection with distribution of the contracts premium taxes depending on your state of residence among other factors a tax may be imposed on your investments “premium tax” at the time your investment is made at the time of a partial or full withdrawal at the time any death benefit proceeds are paid at annuitization or at such other time as taxes may be imposed tax rates ranging from  to  are currently in effect but may change in the future some local jurisdictions also impose a tax if we pay any premium taxes attributable to investments we will impose a similar charge against your contract value premium tax is subject to state requirements we normally will charge you when you annuitize some or all of your contract value we reserve the right to impose this charge for applicable premium taxes andor other taxes when you make a full or partial withdrawal at the time any death benefit proceeds are paid or when those taxes are incurred for these purposes “premium taxes” include any state or local premium or retaliatory taxes and where approval has been obtained federal premium taxes and any federal state or local income excise business or any other

guaranteed interest rate waivers and reduced charges we may agree to waive or reduce charges under our contracts in situations where selling andor maintenance costs associated with the contracts are reduced such as the sale of several contracts to the same contract owners sales of large contracts sales of contracts in connection with a group or sponsored arrangement or mass transactions over multiple contracts we will only waive or reduce such charges on any contract where expenses associated with the sale or distribution of the contract andor costs associated with administering and maintaining the contract are reduced we reserve the right to terminate waiver and reduced charge programs at any time including for issued contracts mortality and expense risk charge we assess a charge against the assets of each subaccount to compensate for certain mortality and expense risks that we assume under the contract the “risk charge” the risk that an annuitant will live longer and therefore receive more annuity payments than we predict through our actuarial calculations at the time the contract is issued is “mortality risk” we also bear mortality risk in connection with death benefit payable under the contract the risk that the expense charges and fees under the contract and separate account are less than our actual administrative and operating expenses is called “expense risk” this risk charge is assessed daily at an annual rate equal to  of each subaccount’s assets this charge may not be increased for the duration of your contract the risk charge will stop at the annuity date if you select fixed annuity payments the base risk charge will continue after the annuity date if you choose variable annuity payments even though we do not bear mortality risk if your annuity option is period certain only we will realize a gain if the risk charge exceeds our actual cost of expenses and benefits and will suffer a loss if such actual costs exceed the risk charge any gain will become part of our general account we may use it for any reason including covering sales expenses on the contracts administrative fee we charge an administrative fee as compensation for costs we incur in operating the separate account issuing and administering the contracts including processing applications and payments and issuing reports to you and to regulatory authorities the administrative fee is assessed daily at an annual rate equal to  of the assets of each subaccount this rate is guaranteed not to increase for the life of your contract a correlation will not necessarily exist between the actual administrative expenses attributable to a particular contract and the administrative fee paid in respect of that particular contract the administrative fee will

first you may choose whether you want those payments to be a fixeddollar amount andor a variabledollar amount second you may choose the form of annuity payments see annuity options below third you may decide how often you want annuity payments to be made the “frequency” of the payments you may not change these selections after the annuity date fixed and variable payment options you may choose fixed annuity payments based on a fixed rate and the a annuity mortality table with the ages set back ten  years variable annuity payments that vary with the investment results of the subaccounts you select or you may choose both converting one portion of the net amount you annuitize into fixed annuity payments and another portion into variable annuity payments if you select fixed annuity payments each periodic annuity payment received will be equal to the initial annuity payment unless you select a joint and survivor life annuity with reduced survivor payments when the primary annuitant dies any net amount you convert to fixed annuity payments will be held in our general account but not under any fixed option if you select variable annuity payments you may choose as many variable investment options as you wish the amount of the periodic annuity payments will vary with the investment results of the variable investment options selected and may be more or less than a fixed payment option after the annuity date annuity units may be exchanged among available variable investment options up to four times in any twelvemonth period how your contract converts into variable annuity payments is explained in more detail in the contracts and the separate account section in the sai annuity options four annuity options are currently available under the contract although additional options may

payments are elected under annuity options  and  you may redeem all remaining guaranteed variable payments after the annuity date also under option  partial redemptions of remaining guaranteed variable payments after the annuity date are available the amount available upon full redemption would be the present value of any remaining guaranteed variable payments at the assumed investment return any applicable withdrawal charge will be deducted from the present value as if you made a full withdrawal or if applicable a partial withdrawal for purposes of calculating the withdrawal charge and free withdrawal amount it will be assumed that the contract was never converted to provide annuity payments and any prior variable annuity payments in that contract year will be treated as if they were partial withdrawals from the contract see the charges fees and deductions—withdrawal charge section in this prospectus for example assume that a contract was issued with a single investment of  and in contract year  the owner elects to receive variable annuity payments under annuity option  in contract year  the owner elects to make a partial redemption of  the withdrawal charge as a

this requirement may limit your options regarding the period andor frequency of annuity payments amount of the first payment your contract contains tables that we use to determine the amount of the

payment frequency you select this amount will be larger in the case of shorter period certain annuities and smaller for longer period certain annuities similarly this amount will be greater for a life only annuity than for a joint and survivor life annuity because we will expect to make payments for a shorter period of time on a life only annuity if you do not choose the period certain only annuity this amount will also vary depending on the age of the annuitants on the annuity date and for some contracts in some states the sex of the annuitants for fixed annuity payments the guaranteed income factors in our tables are based on an annual interest rate of  and the a annuity mortality table with the ages set back  years if you elect a fixed annuity fixed annuity payments will be based on the

applicable variable annuity income factors in effect for your contract on the annuity date which are at least the variable annuity income factors under the contract you may choose any other annuity option we may offer on the option’s effective date a higher assumed investment return would mean a larger first variable annuity payment but subsequent payments would increase only when actual net investment performance exceeds the higher assumed rate and would fall when actual net investment performance is less than the higher assumed rate a lower assumed rate would mean a smaller first payment and a more favorable threshold for increases and decreases if the actual net investment performance is a constant  annually annuity payments will be level the assumed investment return is

and instructions regarding payment of death benefit proceeds if a contract has multiple recipients death benefit    table of contents proceeds will be calculated when we first receive proof of death and instructions in proper form from any recipient the death benefit proceeds still remaining to be paid to other recipients will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying investment options death benefit proceeds death benefit proceeds will be payable on the notice date such proceeds will be reduced by any charge for premium taxes andor other taxes and any contract debt the death benefit proceeds may be payable in a single sum as an annuity option available under the contract towards the purchase of any other annuity option we then offer or in any other manner permitted by the irs and approved by us the owner’s spouse may continue the contract see the death benefits— spousal continuation section of this prospectus in addition there may be legal requirements that limit the recipient’s annuity options and the timing of any payments a recipient should consult a qualified tax adviser before making a death benefit election mandatory distribution on death the contract is intended to comply with all applicable provisions of code section s and any successor provision as deemed necessary by us to qualify the contract as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes if an owner of a nonqualified contract dies before the annuity date distribution of the death benefit proceeds must begin within  year after the owner’s death or complete distribution within  years after the owner’s death in order to satisfy this requirement the designated recipient must receive a final lump sum payment by the fifth anniversary of the death of the contract owner or elect to receive an annuity for life or over a period that does not exceed the life expectancy of the designated recipient with annuity payments that start within  year after the owner’s death or if permitted by the irs elect to receive a systematic distribution over a period not exceeding the beneficiary’s life expectancy using a method that would be acceptable for purposes of calculating the minimum distribution required under section a of the code if an election to receive an annuity is not made within  days of our receipt of proof in proper form of the owner’s death or if earlier  days or shorter period as we permit prior to the first anniversary of the owner’s death the lump sum option will be deemed elected unless otherwise required by law if the lump sum option is deemed elected we will consider that deemed election as receipt of instructions regarding payment of the death benefit proceeds if a nonqualified contract has joint owners this requirement applies to the first contract owner to die the owner may designate that the beneficiary will receive death benefit proceeds through annuity payments for life or life with period certain the owner must designate the payment method in writing in a form acceptable to us the owner may revoke the designation only in writing and only in a form acceptable to us once the owner dies the beneficiary cannot revoke or modify the owner’s designation death benefit amounts the death benefit amount as of the notice date and prior to the annuity date is equal to the greater of   •  your contract value as of that day or     •  your aggregate purchase payments reduced by any applicable charges and fees and further reduced by an amount for each withdrawal that is calculated by multiplying the aggregate purchase payments received by the ratio of the amount of each withdrawal including applicable withdrawal charges to the contract value immediately prior to each withdrawal guaranteed minimum death benefit amount the actual guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb amount will be calculated only when a death benefit becomes payable as a result of the death of the sole annuitant or the first death of an owner who is also an annuitant and is determined as follows we look at the contract as of the first contract anniversary and as of every subsequent contract anniversary prior to the annuity date that is the st nd rd etc until the earlier of   •  the date the annuitant reaches his or her st birthday     •  the date of the annuitant’s death or     •  the annuity date each of these anniversaries is a “milestone date”    table of contents for each milestone date we calculate the death benefit amount and   •  add the aggregate amount of any purchase payments received by us after that milestone date     •  subtract an amount for each withdrawal that is calculated by multiplying that death benefit amount before the withdrawal by the ratio of the amount of each withdrawal that has occurred since that milestone date including applicable withdrawal charges to the contract value immediately prior to each withdrawal and     •  subtract the aggregate amount of any previous charges fees andor taxes effected since that milestone date the highest of these adjusted death benefit amounts as of the notice date is the gmdb amount calculations of any actual guaranteed minimum death benefit are only made once death benefit proceeds become payable under your contract spousal continuation generally a sole designated recipient who is the owner’s spouse may elect to become the owner and sole annuitant if the deceased owner had been the annuitant and continue the contract until the earliest of the spouse’s death the death of the annuitant or the annuity date except in the case of a qualified contract issued under section  of the code on the notice date if the surviving spouse is deemed to have continued the contract we will set the contract value equal to the death benefit proceeds that would have been payable to the spouse as the deemed beneficiary designated recipient of the death benefit proceeds “addin amount” the addin amount will be added to the contract value on the notice date there will not be an adjustment to the contract value if the contract value is equal to or greater than the death benefit proceeds as of the notice date the addin amount will be allocated among investment options in accordance with the current allocation instructions for the contract and may be under certain circumstances considered earnings a joint or contingent owner who is the designated recipient but not the owner’s spouse may not continue the contract example on the notice date the owner’s surviving spouse elects to continue the contract on that date the death benefit proceeds were  and the contract value was  since the surviving spouse elected to continue the contract in lieu of receiving the death benefit proceeds we will increase the contract value by an addin amount of   if the contract value on the notice date was  or higher then nothing would be added to the contract value qualified contract death of annuitant distribution rules under internal revenue service regulations and our administrative procedures if the contract is owned under a qualified plan as defined in sections   b or sections  or a of the code and the annuitant dies before the required beginning date the payment of any death benefit proceeds must be made to the designated recipient in accordance with one of two rules one rule generally requires the death benefit proceeds to commence distribution by december  of the calendar year following the calendar year of the annuitant’s death and continue over the life of his or her beneficiary the “life expectancy method” the second rule requires distribution of the entire death benefit proceeds no later than december  of the calendar year in which the fifth anniversary of the annuitant’s death falls the “fiveyear rule” however the life expectancy method and the fiveyear rule are modified if the sole primary beneficiary is a surviving spouse if the surviving spouse elects to continue the contract and not do an eligible rollover to an ira or another existing eligible plan in his or her name then he or she will be subject to the fiveyear rule however the surviving spouse may waive the fiveyear requirement and elect to take distributions over his or her life expectancy and if the surviving spouse elects to defer the commencement of required distributions beyond the first anniversary of the annuitant’s death the surviving spouse will be deemed to continue the contract in this instance the surviving spouse may defer required distributions until the later of   •  december  of the year following the year the annuitant died or     •  december  of the year in which the deceased annuitant would have turned   further under our administrative procedures if the required distributions election is not received by us in good order by december  of the year following the annuitant’s death or by december  of the year in which the annuitant would have attained age   the lump sum option will be deemed by us to have been elected unless otherwise required by law if the lump sum option is deemed elected we will treat that deemed election as receipt of instructions regarding payment of death benefit proceeds if the annuitant dies after the commencement of rmds except in the case of a roth ira when rmds do not apply but before the annuitant’s entire interest in the contract other than a roth ira has been distributed the remaining interest in    table of contents the contract must be distributed to the designated recipient at least as rapidly as under the distribution method in effect at the time of the annuitant’s death the amount of the death benefit death of the annuitant if the sole surviving annuitant or the first owner who is also an annuitant dies on or before the first contract anniversary or if the annuitant had already reached his or her st birthday as of the first contract anniversary the death benefit proceeds will be equal to the death benefit amount as of the notice date for nonnatural owners the death benefit proceeds will be payable on proof of death of the first annuitant if the sole surviving annuitant or the first owner who is also an annuitant dies prior to the annuity date but after the first contract anniversary and had not yet reached his or her st birthday as of the first contract anniversary the death benefit proceeds will be equal to the greater of   •  the death benefit amount as of

issues the following summary of federal income tax issues is based on our understanding of current tax laws and regulations which may be changed by legislative judicial or administrative action the summary is general in nature and is not intended as tax advice moreover it does not consider any applicable foreign state or local tax laws we do not make any guarantee regarding the tax status federal foreign state or local of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts accordingly you should consult a qualified tax adviser for complete information and advice before purchasing a contract additional tax information is included in the sai diversification requirements and investor control section h of the code provides that the investments underlying a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order for the contract to be treated as an annuity contract and qualify for tax deferral we believe the underlying variable investment options for the contract meet these requirements details on these diversification requirements appear in the pacific select fund sai in addition for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner under current us tax law if a contract owner has excessive control over the investments made by a separate account or the underlying fund the contract owner will be taxed currently on income and gains from the account or fund in other words in such a case of investor control the contract owner would not derive the tax benefits normally associated with variable annuities for more information regarding investor control please refer to the contract sai taxation of annuities  general provisions section  of the code governs the taxation of annuities in general and we designed the contracts to meet the requirements of section  of the code we believe that under current law the contract will be treated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes if the contract owner is a natural person or an agent for a natural person and that we as the issuing insurance company and not the contract owners will be treated as the owner of the investments underlying the contract accordingly no tax should be payable by you as a contract owner as a result of any increase in contract value until you receive money under your contract you should however consider how amounts will be taxed when you do receive them the following discussion assumes that your contract will be treated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes nonqualified contracts  general rules these general rules apply to nonqualified contracts as discussed below however tax rules may differ for qualified contracts and you should consult a qualified tax adviser if you are purchasing a qualified contract taxes payable a contract owner is not taxed on the increases in the value of a contract until an amount is received or deemed to be received an amount could be received or deemed to be received for example if there is a partial distribution a lump sum distribution an annuity payment or a material change in the contract increases in contract value that are received or deemed to be received are taxable to the contract owner as ordinary income distributions of net investment income or capital gains that each subaccount receives from its corresponding portfolio are automatically reinvested in such portfolio unless we on behalf of the separate account elect otherwise as noted above you will be subject to federal income taxes on the investment income from your contract only when it is distributed to you nonnatural persons as owners if a contract is not owned or held by a natural person or as agent for a natural person the contract generally will not be treated as an “annuity” for tax purposes meaning that the contract owner will be subject to current tax on annual increases in contract value at ordinary income rates unless some other exception applies certain entities such as some trusts may be deemed to be acting as agents for natural persons corporations including s corps c corps llcs partnerships and flps and tax exempt entities are non natural persons that will not be deemed to be acting as agents for natural persons    table of contents taxes payable on withdrawals prior to the annuity date amounts you withdraw before annuitization including amounts withdrawn from your contract value in connection with partial withdrawals for payment of any charges and fees will be treated first as taxable income to the extent that your contract value exceeds the aggregate of your investments reduced by nontaxable amounts previously received and then as nontaxable recovery of your investments therefore you include in your gross income the smaller of a the amount of the partial withdrawal or b the amount by which your contract value determined without considering any surrender charge immediately before you receive the distribution exceeds your investment in the contract at that time if at the time of a partial withdrawal your contract value does not exceed your investment in the contract then the withdrawal will not be includable in gross income and will simply reduce your investment exceptions to this rule are distributions in full discharge of your contract a full surrender or distributions from contracts issued and investments made before august   the assignment or pledge of or agreement to assign or pledge the value of the contract for a loan will be treated as a withdrawal subject to these rules you should consult your tax adviser for additional information regarding taking a partial or a full distribution from your contract multiple contracts aggregation rule multiple nonqualified contracts that are issued after october   by us or our affiliates to the same owner during the same calendar year are treated as one contract for purposes of determining the taxation of distributions the amount includible in gross income under code section e prior to the annuity date from any of the contracts a contract received in a taxfree exchange under code section  may be treated as a new contract for this purpose for contracts subject to the aggregation rule the values of the contracts and the investments in the contracts should be added together to determine the taxation under code section e withdrawals will be treated first as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such contracts is withdrawn the treasury department has specific authority under code section e to issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the incomeoutfirst rules for withdrawals prior to the annuity date through the serial purchase of contracts or otherwise as of the date of this prospectus there are no regulations interpreting these aggregation provisions  tax penalty applicable to certain withdrawals and annuity payments the code provides that the taxable portion of a withdrawal or other distribution may be subject to a tax penalty equal to  of that taxable portion unless the withdrawal is   •  made on or after the date you reach age       •  made by a beneficiary after your death     •  attributable to your becoming disabled     •  any payment made under an immediate annuity     •  attributable to an investment in the contract made prior to august   or     •  any distribution that is a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments code section q payments made at least annually over your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or life expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary additional exceptions may apply to certain qualified contracts see the taxes payable on annuity payments and the applicable qualified contracts sections of this prospectus distributions after the annuity date after you annuitize a portion of each annuity payment you receive under a contract generally will be treated as a partial recovery of investments as used here “investments” means the aggregate investments less any amounts that were previously received under the contract but not included in income and will not be taxable in certain circumstances subsequent modifications to an initiallyestablished payment pattern may result in the imposition of a penalty tax the remainder of each annuity payment will be taxed as ordinary income however after the full amount of aggregate investments has been recovered the full amount of each annuity payment will be taxed as ordinary income exactly how an annuity payment is divided into taxable and nontaxable portions depends on the period over which annuity payments are expected to be received    table of contents which in turn is governed by the form of annuity selected and where a lifetime annuity is chosen by the life expectancy of the annuitants or payees such a payment may also be subject to a tax penalty distributions to beneficiary after contract owner’s death generally the same tax rules apply to amounts received by the beneficiary as those that apply to the contract owner except that the early withdrawal penalty tax does not apply thus any annuity payments or lump sum withdrawal will be divided into taxable and nontaxable portions if within sixty days after the date on which a lump sum death benefit first becomes payable and the beneficiary elects to receive annuity or life expectancy payments in lieu of the lump sum death benefit then the beneficiary will not be treated for tax purposes as having received the lump sum death benefit in the tax year it first becomes payable rather in that case the beneficiary will be taxed on the annuity or life expectancy payments as they are received if death occurs after the annuity date but before the expiration of a period certain option the beneficiary will recover the balance of the investments as payments are made and may be allowed a deduction on the final tax return for the unrecovered investments a lump sum payment taken by the beneficiary in lieu of remaining monthly annuity payments is not considered an annuity payment for tax purposes the

adviser prior to effecting a  exchange partial  exchanges rev proc  adopted the provisions of notice  with some modifications finalizing the guidelines for partial  exchanges under rev proc  the  month period is reduced to  months so that a partial exchange will be treated as taxfree under code section  if there are no distributions within  months of the partial  exchange alternatively a partial  exchange will be treated as taxfree under code section  if the taxpayer demonstrates that any distribution taken within the  months is due to a specifically identified condition that occurred between the date of the partial transfer and the distribution the conditions are death disability attaining age   divorce or loss of employment rev proc  removes the subjective element of notice  whether the distribution was contemplated at the time of the partial exchange also rev proc  provides that if the partial exchange does not qualify as a taxfree exchange under code section  it will be treated as a taxable distribution with a subsequent repurchase and that if the partial exchange is treated as taxfree under code section  and this rev proc the two contracts will not be aggregated and treated as one contract but rather will be treated as two separate contracts for tax and penalty purposes you should consult your tax adviser prior to effecting a partial  exchange impact of federal income taxes in general in the case of nonqualified contracts if you are an individual and expect to accumulate your contract value over a relatively long period of time without making significant withdrawals there may be federal income tax advantages in purchasing such a contract this is because any increase in contract value is not subject to current taxation income taxes are deferred until the money is withdrawn at which point taxation occurs only on the gain from the investment in the contract with income taxes deferred you may accumulate more money over the long term through a variable annuity than you may through nontaxdeferred investments the advantage may be greater if you decide to liquidate your contract value in the form of monthly annuity payments after your retirement or if your tax rate is lower at that time than during the period that you held the contract or both when withdrawals or distributions are taken from the variable annuity the gain is taxed as ordinary income this may be a potential disadvantage because money that had been invested in other types of assets may qualify for a more favorable federal tax rate for example the tax rate applicable both to the sale of capital gain assets held more than  year and to the receipt of qualifying dividends by individuals is generally   for lowerincome individuals in contrast an ordinary income tax rate of up to  applies to taxable withdrawals on distributions from a variable annuity also withdrawals or distributions taken from a variable annuity may be subject to a tax penalty equal to  of the taxable portion although exceptions to the tax penalty may apply an owner of a variable annuity cannot deduct or offset losses on transfers to or from subaccounts or at the time of any partial withdrawals if you surrender your contract and your net contract value is less than the aggregate of your investments in the contract reduced by any previous nontaxable distributions there may be a deductible ordinary income loss although the deduction may be limited consult with your tax adviser regarding the impact of federal income taxes on your specific situation    table of contents

participants with one exception discussed below use the uniform lifetime table to calculate their rmds the uniform lifetime table is based on a joint life expectancy and uses the ira owner’s actual age and assumes that the beneficiary is  years younger than the ira owner note that under these final regulations the ira owner does not need to actually have a named beneficiary when they turn   the exception noted above is for an ira owner who has a spouse who is more than  years younger as the sole beneficiary on the ira in that situation the spouse’s actual age and life expectancy will be used

qualified plan must rely on the final and temporary regulations discussed above for determining rmds if any future guidance from the irs is more restrictive than the guidance in these final and temporary regulations the future guidance will be issued without retroactive effect the method of distribution selected must comply with the minimum distribution rules of code section a and the applicable proposed regulations thereunder actuarial value in accordance with recent changes in laws and regulations rmds may be calculated based on the sum of the contract value and the actuarial

quoted results are based on past performance and reflect the performance of all assets held in that subaccount for the stated time period quoted results are neither an estimate nor a guarantee of future investment performance and do not represent the actual experience of amounts invested by any particular contract owner total returns a subaccount may advertise its “average annual total return” over various periods of time “total return” represents the average percentage change in value of an investment in the subaccount from the beginning of a measuring period to the end of that measuring period “annualized” total return assumes that the total return achieved for the measuring period is achieved for each such period for a full year “average annual” total return is computed in accordance with a standard method prescribed by the sec and is also referred to as “standardized return” average annual total return to calculate a subaccount’s average annual total return for a specific measuring period we first take a hypothetical  investment in that subaccount at its thenapplicable subaccount unit value the “initial payment” and we compute the ending redeemable value “full withdrawal value” of that initial payment at the end of the measuring period the redeemable value reflects the effect of all recurring fees and charges applicable to a contract owner under the contract including the risk charge the assetbased administrative fee and the deduction of the applicable withdrawal charge but does not reflect any charges for applicable premium taxes the annual fee is also taken into account assuming an average contract value of  the redeemable value is then divided by the initial payment and this quotient is raised to the n power n represents the number of years in the measuring period and  is subtracted from this result average annual total return is expressed as a percentage t  ervpn —                where   t      average annual total return     erv      ending redeemable value     p      hypothetical initial payment of      n      number of days average annual total return figures will be given for recent one three five and tenyear periods if applicable and may be given for other periods as well such as from commencement of the subaccount’s operations or on a yearbyyear basis when considering “average” total return figures for periods longer than one year it is important to note that the relevant subaccount’s annual total return for any one year in the period might have been greater or less than the average for the entire period aggregate total return a subaccount may use “aggregate” total return figures along with its “average annual” total return figures for various periods these figures represent the cumulative change in value of an investment in the subaccount for a specific period aggregate total returns may be shown by means of schedules charts or graphs and may indicate subtotals of the various components of total return the sec has not prescribed standard formulas for calculating aggregate total return total returns may also be shown for the same periods that do not take into account the withdrawal charge or the annual fee  table of contents yields money market subaccount the “yield” also called “current yield” of the money market subaccount is computed in accordance with a standard method prescribed by the sec the net change in the subaccount’s unit value during a sevenday period is divided by the unit value at the beginning of the period to obtain a base rate of return the current yield is generated when the base rate is “annualized” by multiplying it by the fraction  that is the base rate of return is assumed to be generated each week over a day period and is shown as a percentage of the investment the “effective yield” of the money market subaccount is calculated similarly but when annualized the base rate of return is assumed to be reinvested the effective yield will be slightly higher than the current yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment the formula for effective yield is base period return   to the power of    realized capital gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation of the assets of the underlying money market portfolio are not included in the yield calculation current yield and effective yield do not reflect the deduction of charges for any applicable premium taxes andor any other taxes but do reflect a deduction for the annual fee the risk charge and the administrative fee and assumes an average contract value of  yield information may be accompanied by yield quotations that do not take certain charges into account other subaccounts “yield” of the other subaccounts is computed in accordance with a different standard method prescribed by the sec the net investment income investment income less expenses per subaccount unit earned during a specified onemonth or day period is divided by the subaccount unit value on the last day of the specified period this result is then annualized that is the yield is assumed to be generated each month or each day period for a year according to the following formula which assumes semiannual compounding           yield     a  b cd                     where   a      net investment income earned during the period by the portfolio attributable to the subaccount     b      expenses accrued for the period net of reimbursements     c      the average daily number of subaccount units outstanding during the period that were entitled to receive dividends     d      the unit value of the subaccount units on the last day of the period the yield of each subaccount reflects the deduction of all recurring fees and charges applicable to the subaccount such as the risk charge the assetbased administrative fee and the annual fee assuming an average contract value of  but does not reflect any withdrawal charge or any charge for applicable premium taxes andor any other taxes yield information may be accompanied by yield quotations that do not take certain charges into account general the subaccounts’ yields will vary from time to time depending upon market conditions the composition of each portfolio and operating expenses of the fund allocated to each portfolio consequently any given performance quotation should not be considered representative of the subaccount’s performance in the future yield should also be considered relative to changes in subaccount unit values and to the relative risks associated with the investment policies and objectives of the various portfolios in addition because performance will fluctuate it may not provide a basis for comparing the yield of a subaccount with certain bank deposits or other investments that pay a fixed yield or return for a stated period of time  table of contents performance comparisons and benchmarks in advertisements and sales literature we may compare the performance of some or all of the subaccounts to the performance of other variable annuity issuers in general and to the performance of particular types of variable annuities investing in mutual funds or series of mutual funds with investment objectives similar to each of the subaccounts this performance may be presented as averages or rankings compiled by lipper analytical services inc “lipper” or morningstar inc “morningstar” which are independent services that monitor and rank the performance of variable annuity issuers and mutual funds in each of the major categories of investment objectives on an industrywide basis lipper’s rankings include variable life issuers as well as variable annuity issuers the performance analyses prepared by lipper and morningstar rank such issuers on the basis of total return assuming reinvestment of dividends and distributions but do not take sales charges redemption fees or certain expense deductions at the separate account level into consideration in addition morningstar prepares risk adjusted rankings which consider the effects of market risk on total return performance we may also compare the performance of the subaccounts with performance information included in other publications and services that monitor the performance of insurance company separate accounts or other investment vehicles these other services or publications may be general interest business publications such as the wall street journal barron’s business week forbes fortune and money in addition our reports and communications to contract owners advertisements or sales literature may compare a subaccount’s performance to various benchmarks that measure the performance of a pertinent group of securities widely regarded by investors as being representative of the securities markets in general or as being representative of a particular type of security we may also compare the performance of the subaccounts with that of other appropriate indices of investment securities and averages for peer universes of funds or data developed by us derived from such indices or averages unmanaged indices generally assume the reinvestment of dividends or interest but do not generally reflect deductions for investment management or administrative costs and expenses tax deferred accumulation in reports or other communications to you or in advertising or sales materials we may also describe the effects of taxdeferred compounding on the separate account’s investment returns or upon returns in general these effects may be illustrated in charts or graphs and may include comparisons at various points in time of returns under the contract or in general on a taxdeferred basis with the returns on a taxable basis different tax rates may be assumed in general individuals who own annuity contracts are not taxed on increases in the value under the annuity contract until some form of distribution is made from the contract thus the annuity contract will benefit from tax deferral during the accumulation period which generally will have the effect of permitting an investment in an annuity contract to grow more rapidly than a comparable investment under which increases in value are taxed on a current basis the following chart illustrates this benefit by comparing accumulation under a variable annuity contract with accumulations from an investment on which gains are taxed on a current ordinary income basis the chart shows accumulations on a single purchase payment of  assuming hypothetical annual returns of   and  compounded annually and a tax rate of  the values shown for the taxable investment do not include any deduction for management fees or other expenses but assume that taxes are deducted annually from investment returns the values shown for the variable annuity do not reflect the deduction of contractual expenses such as the risk charge equal to an annual rate of  of average daily account value the administrative fee equal to an annual rate of  of average daily account value and the annual fee equal to  per year if net contract value is  or less charge for premium taxes andor other taxes any applicable withdrawal charge or the expenses of an underlying investment vehicle such as the fund generally the withdrawal charge is equal to  of the amount withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are one year old  of the amount withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are two years old  of the amount withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are three years old  of the amount  table of contents withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are four years old  of the amount withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are five years old and  of the amount withdrawn attributable to purchase payments that are six years old or older the age of purchase payments is determined as described in the prospectus there is no withdrawal charge to the extent that total withdrawals that are free of charge during the contract year do not exceed  of the sum of your remaining purchase payments at the beginning of the contract year that have been held under your contract for less than six years plus additional purchase payments applied to your contract during that contract year for a description of the charges and expenses under the contract see the charges fees and deductions section in the prospectus if these expenses and fees were taken into account they would reduce the investment return shown for both the taxable investment and the hypothetical variable annuity contract in addition these values assume that you do not surrender the contract or make any withdrawals until the end of the period shown the chart assumes a full withdrawal at the end of the period shown of all contract value and the payment of taxes at the  rate on the amount in excess of the purchase payment the rates of return illustrated are hypothetical and are not an estimate or guarantee of performance actual tax rates may vary for different assets eg capital gains and qualifying dividend income and taxpayers from that illustrated and withdrawals by and distributions to contract owners who have not reached age   may be subject to a tax penalty of  power of tax deferral  investment at annual rates of return of   and  taxed    table of contents distribution of the contracts pacific select distributors inc psd pacific select distributors inc our subsidiary acts as the distributor of the contracts and offers the contracts on a continuous basis psd is located at  newport center drive newport beach california  psd is registered as a brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra we pay psd for acting as distributor under a distribution agreement we and psd enter into selling agreements with brokerdealers whose registered representatives are authorized by state insurance departments to solicit applications for the contracts the aggregate amount of underwriting commissions paid to psd for   and  with regard to this contract was   and  respectively of which  was retained psd or an affiliate pays various sales compensation to brokerdealers that solicit applications for the contracts psd or an affiliate also may provide reimbursement for other expenses associated with the promotion and solicitation of applications for the contracts your registered representative typically receives a portion of the compensation that is payable to his or her brokerdealer in connection with the contract depending on the agreement between your registered representative and his or her firm pacific life is not involved in determining that compensation arrangement which may present its own incentives or conflicts you may ask your registered representative how heshe will personally be compensated for the transaction under certain circumstances where psd pays lower initial commissions certain brokerdealers that solicit applications for contracts may be paid an ongoing persistency trail commission sometimes called a residual the mix of purchase paymentbased versus trail commissions varies depending upon our agreement with the selling brokerdealer and the commission option selected by your registered representative or brokerdealer certain brokerdealers may also be paid an amount under a persistency program which will be based on assets under management and duration of contracts the amount under the persistency program for a registered representative is not expected to exceed  of their total assets under management in addition to the purchase paymentbased trail commissions and persistency program described above we andor an affiliate may pay additional cash compensation from our own resources in connection with the promotion and solicitation of applications for the contracts by some but not all brokerdealers the range of additional cash compensation based on purchase payments generally does not exceed  and trailing compensation based on account value generally does not exceed  on an annual basis such additional compensation may give pacific life greater access to registered representatives of the brokerdealers that receive such compensation while this greater access provides the opportunity for training and other educational programs so that your registered representative may serve you better this additional compensation also may afford pacific life a “preferred” status at the recipient brokerdealer and provide some other marketing benefit such as website placement access to registered representative lists extra marketing assistance or other heightened visibility and access to the brokerdealer’s sales force that may otherwise influence the way that the brokerdealer and the

the separate account   calculating subaccount unit values the unit value of the subaccount units in each variable investment option is computed at the close of the new york stock exchange which is usually  pm eastern time on each business day the initial unit value of each subaccount was  on the business day the subaccount began operations at the end of each business day the unit value for a subaccount is equal to y × z               where   y      the unit value for that subaccount as of the end of the preceding business day and     z      the net investment factor for that subaccount for the period a “valuation period” between that business day and the immediately preceding business day the “net investment factor” for a subaccount for any valuation period is equal to  table of contents a ÷ b — c               where   a      the “per share value of the assets” of that subaccount as of the end of that valuation period which is equal to abc               where   a      the net asset value per share of the corresponding portfolio shares held by that subaccount as of the end of that valuation period     b      the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distributions made by the fund for that portfolio during that valuation period and     c      any per share charge a negative number or credit a positive number for any income taxes or other amounts set aside during that valuation period as a reserve for any income andor any other taxes which we determine to have resulted from the operations of the subaccount or contract andor any taxes attributable directly or indirectly to investments                   b      the net asset value per share of the corresponding portfolio shares held by the subaccount as of the end of the preceding valuation period and     c      a factor that assesses against the subaccount net assets for each calendar day in the valuation period the basic risk charge plus any applicable increase in the risk charge and the administrative fee see the charges fees and deductions section in the prospectus as explained in the prospectus the annual fee if applicable will be charged proportionately against your investment options assessments against your variable investment options are assessed against your variable account value through the automatic debit of subaccount units the annual fee decreases the number of subaccount units attributed to your contract but does not alter the unit value for any subaccount variable annuity payment amounts the following steps show how we determine the amount of each variable annuity payment under your contract first pay applicable premium taxes when you convert your net contract value into annuity payments you must pay any applicable charge for premium taxes andor other taxes on your contract value unless applicable law requires those taxes to be paid at a later time we assess this charge by reducing your account value proportionately relative to your account value in each subaccount and in any fixed option in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the charges the remaining amount of your available net contract value may be used to provide variable annuity payments alternatively your remaining available net contract value may be used to provide fixed annuity payments or it may be divided to provide both fixed and variable annuity payments you may also choose to withdraw some or all of your remaining net contract value less any applicable annual fees any charge for an optional rider andor withdrawal charge and any charges for premium taxes andor other taxes without converting this amount into annuity payments second the first variable payment we begin by referring to your contract’s option table for your annuity option the “annuity option table” the annuity option table allows us to calculate the dollar amount of the first variable annuity payment under your contract based on the amount applied toward the variable annuity the number that the annuity option table yields will be based on the annuitant’s age and in certain cases sex and assumes a  rate of return as described in more detail below   example assume a man is  years of age at his annuity date and has selected a lifetime annuity with monthly payments guaranteed for  years according to the annuity option table this man should receive an initial monthly payment of  for every  of his contract value reduced by applicable  table of contents   charges that he will be using to provide variable payments therefore if his contract value after deducting applicable fees and charges is  on his annuity date and he applies this entire amount toward his variable annuity his first monthly payment will be  you may choose any other annuity option table that assumes a different rate of return which we offer at the time your annuity option is effective third subaccount annuity units for each subaccount we use the amount of the first variable annuity payment under your contract attributed to each subaccount to determine the number of subaccount annuity units that will form the basis of subsequent payment amounts first we use the annuity option table to determine the amount of that first variable payment for each subaccount then for each subaccount we divide that amount of the first variable annuity payment by the value of one subaccount annuity unit the “subaccount annuity unit value” as of the end of the annuity date to obtain the number of subaccount annuity units for that particular subaccount the number of subaccount annuity units used to calculate subsequent payments under your contract will not change unless exchanges of annuity units are made or if the joint and survivor annuity option is elected and the primary annuitant dies first but the value of those annuity units will change daily as described below fourth the subsequent variable payments the amount of each subsequent variable annuity payment will be the sum of the amounts payable based on each subaccount the amount payable based on each subaccount is equal to the number of subaccount annuity units for that subaccount multiplied by their subaccount annuity unit value at the end of the business day in each payment period you elected that corresponds to the annuity date each subaccount’s subaccount annuity unit value like its subaccount unit value changes each day to reflect the net investment results of the underlying investment vehicle as well as the assessment of the risk charge at an annual rate of  and the administrative fee at an annual rate of  in addition the calculation of subaccount annuity unit value incorporates an additional factor as discussed in more detail below this additional factor adjusts subaccount annuity values to correct for the option table’s implicit assumption of a  annual investment return on amounts applied but not yet used to furnish annuity benefits different subaccounts may be selected for your contract before and after your annuity date subject to any restrictions we may establish currently you may exchange subaccount annuity units in any subaccount for subaccount annuity units in any other subaccounts up to four times in any twelve month period after your annuity date the number of subaccount annuity units in any subaccount may change due to such exchanges exchanges following your annuity date will be made by exchanging subaccount annuity units of equivalent aggregate value based on their relative subaccount annuity unit values understanding the “assumed investment return” factor the annuity option table incorporates a number of implicit assumptions in determining the amount of your first variable annuity payment as noted above the numbers in the annuity option table reflect certain actuarial assumptions based on the annuitant’s age and in some cases the annuitant’s sex in addition these numbers assume that the amount of your contract value that you convert to a variable annuity will have a positive net investment return of  each year during the payout of your annuity thus  is referred to as an “assumed investment return” the subaccount annuity unit value for a subaccount will increase only to the extent that the investment performance of that subaccount exceeds the risk charge the administrative fee and the assumed investment return the subaccount annuity unit value for any subaccount will generally be less than the subaccount unit value for that same subaccount and the difference will be the amount of the assumed investment return factor  table of contents   example assume the net investment performance of a subaccount is at a rate of  per year after deduction of the  risk charge and the  administrative fee the subaccount unit value for that subaccount would increase at a rate of  per year but the subaccount annuity unit value would not increase or decrease at all the net investment factor for that  return  is then divided by the factor for the  assumed investment return  and  is subtracted from the result to determine the adjusted rate of change in subaccount annuity unit value              —     ×    if the net investment performance of a subaccount’s assets is at a rate less than  per year the subaccount annuity unit value will decrease even if the subaccount unit value is increasing   example assume the net investment performance of a subaccount is at a rate of  per year after deduction of the  risk charge and the  administrative fee the subaccount unit value for that subaccount would increase at a rate of  per year but the subaccount annuity unit value would decrease at a rate of  per year the net investment factor for that  return  is then divided by the factor for the  assumed investment return  and  is subtracted from the result to determine the adjusted rate of change in subaccount annuity unit value              —   — — ×   — the assumed investment return will always cause increases in subaccount annuity unit values to be somewhat less than if the assumption had not been made will cause decreases in subaccount annuity unit values to be somewhat greater than if the assumption had not been made and will as shown in the example above sometimes cause a decrease in subaccount annuity unit values to take place when an increase would have occurred if the assumption had not been made if we had assumed a higher investment return in our annuity option tables it would produce annuities with larger first payments but the increases in subaccount annuity payments would be smaller and the decreases in subsequent annuity payments would be greater a lower assumed investment return would produce annuities with smaller first payments and the increases in subsequent annuity payments would be greater and the decreases in subsequent annuity payments would be smaller redemptions of remaining guaranteed variable payments under options  and  if variable payments are elected under annuity options  and  you may redeem all remaining guaranteed variable payments after the annuity date also under option  partial redemptions of remaining guaranteed variable payments after the annuity date are available the amount available upon full redemption would be the present value of any remaining guaranteed variable payments at the assumed investment return any applicable withdrawal charge will be deducted from the present value as if you made a full withdrawal or if applicable a partial withdrawal for purposes of calculating the withdrawal charge and free withdrawal amount it will be assumed that the contract was never converted to provide annuity payments and any prior variable annuity payments in that contract year will be treated as if they were partial withdrawals from the contract see the charges fees and deductions — withdrawal charge section in the prospectus for example assume that a contract was issued with a single investment of  and in contract year  the owner elects to receive variable annuity payments under annuity option  in contract year  the owner elects to make a partial redemption of  the withdrawal charge as a percentage of the purchase payments with an age of  years is  assuming the free withdrawal amount immediately prior to the partial redemption is  the withdrawal charge for the partial redemption will be       no withdrawal charge will be imposed on a redemption if   •  the annuity option is elected as the form of payments of death benefit proceeds or     •  the annuitant dies before the period certain has ended and the beneficiary requests a redemption of the variable annuity payments  table of contents the variable payment amount we use in calculating the present value is determined by summing an amount for each subaccount which we calculate by multiplying your subaccount annuity units by the annuity unit value next computed after we receive your redemption request this variable payment amount is then discounted at the assumed investment return from each future annuity payment date that falls within the payment guaranteed period the sum of these discounted remaining variable payment amounts is the present value of remaining guaranteed variable payments if you elect to redeem all remaining guaranteed variable payments in a single sum we will not make any additional variable annuity payments during the remaining guaranteed period after the redemption if you elect to redeem a portion of the remaining guaranteed variable payments in a single sum we will reduce the number of annuity units for each subaccount by the same percentage as the partial redemption value bears to the amount available upon a full redemption redemption of remaining guaranteed variable payments will not affect the amount of any fixed annuity payments corresponding dates if any transaction or event under your contract is scheduled to occur on a “corresponding date” that does not exist in a given calendar period the transaction or event will be deemed to occur on the following business day in addition as stated in the prospectus any event scheduled to occur on a day that is not a business day will occur on the next succeeding business day   example if your contract is issued on february  in year  a leap year your contract anniversary in years   and  will be on march      example if your annuity date is july  and you select monthly annuity payments the payments received will be based on valuations made on july  august  october  for september october  december  for november december  january  march  for february march  may  for april may  and july  for june age and sex of annuitant the contracts generally provide for sexdistinct annuity income factors in the case of life annuities statistically females tend to have longer life expectancies than males consequently if the amount of annuity payments is based on life expectancy they will ordinarily be higher if an annuitant is male than if an annuitant is female certain states’ regulations prohibit sexdistinct annuity income factors and contracts issued in those states will use unisex factors in addition contracts issued in connection with qualified plans are required to use unisex factors we may require proof of your annuitant’s age and sex before or after commencing annuity payments if the age or sex or both of your annuitant are incorrectly stated in your contract we will correct the amount payable to equal the amount that the annuitized portion of the contract value under that contract would have purchased for your annuitant’s correct age and sex if we make the correction after annuity payments have started and we have made overpayments based on the incorrect information we will deduct the amount of the overpayment with interest at  a year from any payments due then or later if we have made underpayments we will add the amount with interest at  a year of the underpayments to the next payment we make after we receive proof of the correct age andor sex additionally we may require proof of the annuitant’s or owner’s age before any payments associated with the death benefit provisions of your contract are made if the age or sex of the annuitant is incorrectly stated in your contract we will base any payment associated with the death benefit provisions on your contract on the annuitant’s or owner’s correct age or sex  table of contents systematic transfer programs the fixed options are not available in connection with portfolio rebalancing if you are using the earnings sweep you may also use portfolio rebalancing only if you selected the money market subaccount or the fixed option as your sweep option you may not use dollar cost averaging and the earnings sweep at the same time the systematic transfer options are not available after you annuitize and are subject to the same requirements and restrictions as nonsystematic transfers in addition no fixed options may be used as the target investment option under any systematic transfer program dollar cost averaging when you request dollar cost averaging you are authorizing us to make periodic reallocations of your contract value without waiting for any further instruction from you you may request to begin or stop dollar cost averaging at any time prior to your annuity date the effective date of your request will be the day we receive notice from you in a form satisfactory to us your request may specify the date on which you want your first transfer to be made your first transfer may not be made until  days after your contract date and if you specify an earlier date your first transfer will be delayed until one calendar month after the date you specify if you request dollar cost averaging on your application for your contract and you fail to specify a date for your first transfer your first transfer will be made one period after your contract date that is if you specify monthly transfers the first transfer will occur  days after your contract date quarterly transfers  days after your contract date semiannual transfers  days after your contract date and if you specify annual transfers the first transfer will occur on your contract anniversary if you stop dollar cost averaging you must wait  days before you may begin this option again currently we are not enforcing the  day waiting period but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the future your request to begin dollar cost averaging must specify the investment option you wish to transfer money from your “source account” you may choose any one investment option as your source account the account value of your source account must be at least  for you to begin dollar cost averaging currently we are not enforcing the minimum account value but we reserve the right to enforce such minimum amounts in the future your request to begin dollar cost averaging must also specify the amount and frequency of your transfers you may choose monthly quarterly semiannual or annual transfers the amount of your transfers may be specified as a dollar amount or a percentage of your source account value however each transfer must be at least  currently we are not enforcing the minimum transfer amount but we reserve the right to enforce such minimum amounts in the future dollar cost averaging transfers are not subject to the same requirements and limitations as other transfers finally your request must specify the variable investment options you wish to transfer amounts to your “target accounts” if you select more than one target account your dollar cost averaging request must specify how transferred amounts should be allocated among the target accounts your source account may not also be a target account your dollar cost averaging transfers will continue until the earlier of   •  your request to stop dollar cost averaging is effective or     •  your source account value is zero or     •  your annuity date if as a result of a dollar cost averaging transfer your source account value falls below any minimum account value we may establish we have the right at our option to transfer that remaining account value to your target accounts on a proportionate basis relative to your most recent allocation instructions we may change terminate or suspend the dollar cost averaging option at any time  table of contents portfolio rebalancing portfolio rebalancing allows you to maintain the percentage of your contract value allocated to each variable investment option at a preset level prior to annuitization   for example you could specify that  of your contract value should be in the equity index subaccount  in the managed bond subaccount and  in the growth lt subaccount over time the variations in each subaccount’s investment results will shift this balance of these subaccount value allocations if you elect the portfolio rebalancing feature we will automatically transfer your subaccount value back to the percentages you specify you may choose to have rebalances made quarterly semiannually or annually until your annuity date portfolio rebalancing is not available after you annuitize procedures for selecting portfolio rebalancing are generally the same as those discussed in detail above for selecting dollar cost averaging you may make your request at any time prior to your annuity date and it will be effective when we receive it in a form satisfactory to us if you stop portfolio rebalancing you must wait  days to begin again currently we are not enforcing the day waiting period but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the future if you specify a date fewer than  days after your contract date your first rebalance will be delayed one month and if you request rebalancing on your application but do not specify a date for the first rebalance it will occur one period after your contract date as described above under dollar cost averaging we may change terminate or suspend the portfolio rebalancing feature at any time earnings sweep an earnings sweep automatically transfers the earnings from the fixed option or the money market subaccount the “sweep option” to one or more other variable investment options your “target options” the account value of your sweep option will be required to be at least  when you elect the earnings sweep currently we are not enforcing the minimum account value but we reserve the right to enforce such minimum amounts in the future you may choose to have earnings sweeps occur monthly quarterly semiannually or annually until you annuitize at each earnings sweep we will automatically transfer your accumulated earnings attributable to your sweep option for the previous period proportionately to your target options that is if you select a monthly earnings sweep we will transfer the sweep option earnings from the preceding month if you select a semiannual earnings sweep we will transfer the sweep option earnings accumulated over the preceding six months earnings sweep transfers are not subject to the same requirements and limitations as other transfers to determine the earnings we take the change in the sweep option’s account value during the sweep period add any withdrawals or transfers out of the sweep option account that occurred during the sweep period and subtract any allocations to the sweep option account during the sweep period the result of this calculation represents the “total earnings” for the sweep period if during the sweep period you withdraw or transfer amounts from the sweep option account we assume that earnings are withdrawn or transferred before any other account value therefore your “total earnings” for the sweep period will be reduced by any amounts withdrawn or transferred during the sweep option period the remaining earnings are eligible for the sweep transfer procedures for selecting the earnings sweep are generally the same as those discussed in detail above for selecting dollar cost averaging and portfolio rebalancing you may make your request at any time and it will be effective when we receive it in a form satisfactory to us if you stop the earnings sweep you must wait  days to begin again currently we are not enforcing the day waiting period but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the future if you specify a date fewer than  days after your contract date your first earnings sweep will be delayed one month and if you request the earnings sweep on your application but do not specify a date for the first sweep it will occur one period after your contract date as described above under dollar cost averaging  table of contents if you are using the earnings sweep you may also use portfolio rebalancing only if you selected the fixed option as your sweep option or if the money market was elected as the sweep option it may not be rebalanced as part of portfolio rebalancing you may not use the earnings sweep and dollar cost averaging at the same time if as a result of an earnings sweep transfer your source account value falls below any minimum account value we may establish we have the right at our option to transfer that remaining account value to your target accounts on a proportionate basis relative to your most recent allocation instructions we may change terminate or suspend the earnings sweep option at any time preauthorized withdrawals you may specify a dollar amount for your preauthorized withdrawals or you may specify a percentage of your contract value or an account value you may direct us to make your preauthorized withdrawals from one or more specific investment options if you do not give us these specific instructions amounts will be deducted proportionately from your account value in each investment option procedures for selecting preauthorized withdrawals are generally the same as those discussed in detail above for selecting dollar cost averaging portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweeps you may make your request at any time and it will be effective when we receive it in a form satisfactory to us if you stop the preauthorized withdrawals you must wait  days to begin again currently we are not enforcing the day waiting period but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the future if your preauthorized withdrawals cause your account value in any investment option to fall below  we have the right at our option to transfer that remaining account value to your other investment options on a proportionate basis relative to your most recent allocation instructions if your preauthorized withdrawals cause your contract value to fall below  we may at our option terminate your contract and send you the remaining withdrawal proceeds preauthorized withdrawals are subject to the same withdrawal charges as are other withdrawals and each withdrawal is subject to any applicable charge for premium taxes andor other taxes to federal income tax on its taxable portion and if you have not reached age   may be subject to a  federal tax penalty death benefit the standard death benefit payable will be calculated as of the date we receive in a form satisfactory to us proof of the annuitant’s death or if applicable the contract owner’s death and instructions regarding payment any guaranteed minimum death benefit payable will be calculated as of the date we are first notified of the death any claim of a death benefit must be made in a form satisfactory to us a recipient of death benefit proceeds may elect to have this benefit paid in one lump sum in periodic payments in the form of a lifetime annuity or in some combination of these annuity payments normally will begin within  days once we receive all information necessary to process the claim if your contract names joint or contingent annuitants no death benefit will be payable unless and until the last annuitant dies prior to the annuity date or a contract owner dies prior to the annuity date if both the contract owners and the annuitants are nonnatural persons no death benefit will be payable and any distribution will be treated as a withdrawal and subject to any applicable charges for annual fees transaction fees withdrawal fees premium taxes andor other taxes and withdrawal charges death of an annuitant if a joint annuitant who is not a contract owner dies prior to the annuity date the surviving joint annuitant becomes the annuitant if your annuitant is not a contract owner and dies or if there is no surviving joint annuitant the surviving contingent annuitant becomes the annuitant if there is no surviving contingent annuitant the death benefit becomes payable any death benefit payable on the death of the annuitant is payable to the surviving beneficiary if no beneficiary survives any death benefit will be payable to the surviving owner if there is one if not any death benefit will be payable to the owner’s estate  table of contents death of a contract owner if any contract owner dies prior to the annuity date while the annuitant is still living a death benefit may be payable if that contract owner was the sole annuitant or a joint annuitant under the contract any death benefit will be payable to the surviving beneficiary or to the owner’s estate if no beneficiary survives if that contract owner was not an annuitant under the contract any death benefit will be payable to the surviving joint owner of the contract if there is one if not the death benefit will be payable to the surviving contingent owner if there is one if not any death benefit will be payable to the surviving designated beneficiary or to the owner’s estate if no designated beneficiary survives if the joint or contingent owner is the deceased contract owner’s surviving spouse he or she may elect to become the contract owner and continue the contract rather than receive the death benefit proceeds joint annuitants on qualified contracts on your annuity date if your contract was issued in connection with a qualified plan subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” and you change your marital status after your contract date you may be permitted to add a joint annuitant and to change your joint annuitant generally speaking you may be permitted to add a new spouse as a joint annuitant and you may be permitted to remove a joint annuitant who is no longer your spouse more on federal tax issues section h of the code provides that the investments underlying a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements details on these diversification requirements appear in the pacific select fund sai we believe the underlying variable investment options for the contract meet these requirements in connection with the issuance of temporary regulations relating to diversification requirements under section h the treasury department announced that such regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to which you may direct your investments to particular divisions of a separate account such guidance may be included in regulations or revenue rulings under section d relating to the definition of a variable contract we reserve the right to make such changes as we deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that your contract continues to qualify as an annuity for tax purposes any such changes will apply uniformly to affected contract owners and will be made with such notice to affected contract owners as is feasible under the circumstances for a variable life insurance contract or a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner under current us tax law if a contract owner has excessive control over the investments made by a separate account or the underlying fund the contract owner will be taxed currently on income and gains from the account or fund in other words in such a case of “investor control” the contract owner would not derive the tax benefits normally associated with variable life insurance or variable annuities generally according to the irs there are two ways that impermissible investor control may exist the first relates to the design of the contract or the relationship between the contract and a separate account or underlying fund for example at various times the irs has focused on among other factors the number and type of investment choices available pursuant to a given variable contract whether the contract offers access to funds that are available to the general public the number of transfers that a contract owner may make from one investment option to another and the degree to which a contract owner may select or control particular investments with respect to this first aspect of investor control we believe that the design of our contracts and the relationship between our contracts and the portfolios satisfy the current view of the irs on this subject such that the investor control doctrine should not apply however because of some uncertainty with respect to this subject and because the irs may issue further guidance on this subject we reserve the right to make such changes as we deem necessary or appropriate to reduce the risk that your contract might not qualify as a life insurance contract or as an annuity for tax purposes the second way that impermissible investor control might exist concerns your actions under the irs pronouncements you may not select or control particular investments other than choosing among broad investment choices  table of contents such as selecting a particular portfolio you may not select or direct the purchase or sale of a particular investment of a separate account a subaccount or variable investment option or a portfolio all investment decisions concerning the separate accounts and the subaccounts must be made by us and all investment decisions concerning the underlying portfolios must be made by the portfolio manager for such portfolio in his or her sole and absolute discretion and not by the contract owner furthermore under the irs pronouncements you may not enter into an agreement or arrangement with a portfolio manager of a portfolio or communicate directly or indirectly with such a portfolio manager or any related investment officers concerning the selection quality or rate of return of any specific investment or group of investments held by a portfolio and you may not enter into any such agreement or arrangement or have any such communication with us or plfa finally the irs may issue additional guidance on the investor control doctrine which might further restrict your actions or features of the variable contract such guidance could be applied retroactively if any of the rules outlined above are not complied with the irs may seek to tax you currently on income and gains from a portfolio such that you would not derive the tax benefits normally associated with variable life insurance or variable annuities although highly unlikely such an event may have an adverse impact on the fund and other variable contracts we urge you to consult your own tax adviser with respect to the application of the investor control doctrine loans certain owners of qualified contracts may borrow against their contracts otherwise loans from us are not permitted you may request a loan from us using your contract value as your only security if yours is a qualified contract that is   •  not subject to title  of erisa     •  issued under section b of the code and     •  permits loans under its terms a “loan eligible plan” you will be charged interest on your contract debt at a fixed annual rate equal to  the amount held in the loan account to secure your loan will earn a return equal to an annual rate of  this loan rate may vary by state interest charges accrue on your contract debt daily beginning on the effective date of your loan interest earned on the loan account value accrue daily beginning on the day following the effective date of the loan and those earnings will be transferred once a year to your investment options in accordance with your most recent allocation instructions we may change these loan provisions to reflect changes in the code or interpretations thereof tax and legal matters the tax and erisa rules relating to contract loans are complex and in many cases unclear for these reasons and because the rules vary depending on the individual circumstances these loans are processed by your plan administrator we urge you to consult with a qualified tax adviser prior to effecting any loan transaction under your contract generally interest paid on your loan under a b taxsheltered annuity will be considered nondeductible “personal interest” under section h of the code to the extent the loan comes from and is secured by your pretax contributions even if the proceeds of your loan are used to acquire your principal residence in order to secure your loan on the effective date of your loan we will transfer an amount equal to the principal amount of your loan into an account called the “loan account” the loan account is held under the general account to make this transfer we will transfer amounts proportionately from your investment options based on your account value in each investment option as your loan is repaid a portion corresponding to the amount of the repayment of any amount then held as security for your loan will be transferred from the loan account back into your investment options relative to your most recent allocation instructions  table of contents a transfer from the loan account back into your investment options following a loan repayment is not considered a transfer under the transfer limitations as stated in the how your investments are allocated— transfers and markettiming restrictions section in the prospectus loan terms you may have only one loan outstanding at any time the minimum loan amount is  subject to certain state limitations your contract debt at the effective date of your loan may not exceed the lesser of   •   of your contract value or     •   less your highest outstanding contract debt during the month period immediately preceding the effective date of your loan you should refer to the terms of your particular loan eligible plan for any additional loan restrictions if you have other loans outstanding pursuant to other loan eligible plans the amount you may borrow may be further restricted we are not responsible for making any determination including loan amounts permitted or any interpretation with respect to your loan eligible plan repayment terms your loan including principal and accrued interest generally must be repaid in quarterly installments an installment will be due in each quarter on the date corresponding to the effective date of your loan beginning with the first such date following the effective date of your loan see the qualified contracts — loans section in the prospectus   example on may  we receive your loan request and your loan is effective your first quarterly payment will be due on august  adverse tax consequences may result if you fail to meet the repayment requirements for your loan you must repay principal and interest of any loan in substantially equal payments over the term of the loan generally the term of the loan will be  years from the effective date of the loan however if you have certified to us that your loan proceeds are to be used to acquire a principal residence for yourself you may request a loan term of  years in either case however you must repay your loan prior to your annuity date if you elect to annuitize or withdraw your net contract value while you have an outstanding loan we will deduct any contract debt from your contract value at the time of the annuitization or withdrawal to repay the contract debt you may prepay your entire loan at any time if you do so we will bill you for any unpaid interest that has accrued through the date of payoff your loan will be considered repaid only when the interest due has been paid subject to any necessary approval of state insurance authorities while you have contract debt outstanding we will treat all payments you send us as investments unless you specifically indicate that your payment is a loan repayment or include your loan payment notice with your payment to the extent allowed by law any loan repayments in excess of the amount then due will be applied to the principal balance of your loan such repayments will not change the due dates or the periodic repayment amount due for future periods if a loan repayment is in excess of the principal balance of your loan any excess repayment will be refunded to you repayments we receive that are less than the amount then due will be returned to you unless otherwise required by law if we have not received your full payment by its due date we will declare the entire remaining loan balance in default at that time we will send written notification of the amount needed to bring the loan back to a current status you will have sixty  days from the date on which the loan was declared in default the “grace period” to make the required payment if the required payment is not received by the end of the grace period the defaulted loan balance plus accrued interest and any withdrawal charge will be withdrawn from your contract value if amounts under your contract are eligible for distribution in order for an amount to be eligible for distribution from a tsa funded by salary reductions you must meet one of five triggering events the triggering events are  table of contents   •  attainment of age       •  severance from employment     •  death     •  disability and     •  financial hardship with respect to contributions only not income or earnings on these contributions if those amounts are not eligible for distribution the defaulted loan balance plus accrued interest and any withdrawal charge will be considered a deemed distribution and will be withdrawn when such contract values become eligible in either case the distribution or the deemed distribution will be considered a currently taxable event and may be subject to federal tax withholding the withdrawal charge and may be subject to a  federal tax penalty if there is a deemed distribution under your contract and to the extent allowed by law any future withdrawals will first be applied as repayment of the defaulted contract debt including accrued interest and charges for applicable taxes any amounts withdrawn and applied as repayment of contract debt will first be withdrawn from your loan account and then from your investment options on a proportionate basis relative to the account value in each investment option if you have an outstanding loan that is in default the defaulted contract debt will be considered a withdrawal for the purpose of calculating any death benefit amount andor guaranteed minimum death benefit the terms of any such loan are intended to qualify for the exception in code section p so that the distribution of the loan proceeds will not constitute a distribution that is taxable to you to that end these loan provisions will be interpreted to ensure and maintain such tax qualification despite any other provisions to the contrary subject to any regulatory approval we reserve the right to amend your contract to reflect any clarifications that may be needed or are appropriate to maintain such tax qualification or to conform any terms of our loan arrangement with you to any applicable changes in the tax qualification requirements we will send you a copy of any such amendment if you refuse such an amendment it may result in adverse tax consequences to you safekeeping of assets we are responsible for the safekeeping of the assets of the separate account these

as well as the forecasted interest cash flows related to anticipated investment purchases and liability issuances such anticipated investment purchases and liability issuances are considered probable to occur and are generally completed within  years of the inception of the hedge       foreign currency interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a fixed or floating rate foreigndenominated asset or liability to a us dollar fixed rate asset or liability the foreign currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of an initial principal amount in two currencies and the agreement to reexchange the currencies at a future date at an agreed exchange rate there is also periodic exchange of interest payments in the two currencies at specified intervals calculated using agreed upon rates and the exchanged principal amounts the main currencies that the company hedges are the euro british pound and canadian dollar       forward starting interest rate swaps are used to hedge the variability in the future interest receipts or payments stemming from the anticipated purchase of fixed rate securities or issuance of fixed rate liabilities due to changes in benchmark interest rates these derivatives are predominantly used to lock in interest rate levels to match future cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities forward starting interest rate swaps involve the exchange at specified intervals of interest payments resulting from the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an underlying notional amount to begin at a specified date in the future for a specified period of time generally no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party the pl table of contents     notional amounts of the contracts do not represent future cash requirements as the company intends to close out open positions prior to expiration     interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a floating rate asset or liability to a fixed rate to hedge the variability of cash flows of the hedged asset or liability due to changes in benchmark interest rates these derivatives are predominantly used to better match the cash flow characteristics between assets and liabilities these agreements involve the exchange at specified intervals of interest payments resulting from the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an underlying notional amount generally no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party       when a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in oci and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings and the ineffective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in net realized investment gain loss for the years ended december    and  the gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of designated cash flow hedges were insignificant no component of the hedging instrument’s estimated fair value

probable of occurring       fair value hedges       the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in the estimated fair values of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate       interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a fixed rate asset or liability to a floating rate to hedge the changes in estimated fair value of the hedged asset or liability due to changes in benchmark interest rates these derivatives are used primarily to closely match the duration of the assets supporting specific liabilities       when a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge the changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in net realized investment gain loss the change in value of the hedged item associated with the risk being hedged is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for the years ended december    and  hedge ineffectiveness related to designated fair value hedges reflected in net realized investment gain loss was insignificant no component of the hedging instrument’s estimated fair value is excluded from the determination of effectiveness       derivatives not designated as hedging instruments       the company has certain insurance and reinsurance contracts that are considered to have embedded derivatives when it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic and risk characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract and that a separate instrument with the same

contracts that guarantees net principal over a tenyear holding period as well as riders on certain variable annuity contracts that guarantee a minimum withdrawal benefit over specified periods subject to certain restrictions these variable annuity riders va riders are considered embedded derivatives and are recorded in future policy benefits       the company employs hedging strategies designed to mitigate the equity risk associated with the portion of va riders not covered by reinsurance equity put swaps are utilized to economically hedge against movements in the equity markets these equity put swaps involve the exchange of periodic fixed rate payments for the return at the end of the swap agreement of the equity index below a specified strike price generally no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party additionally the company utilizes total return swaps based upon the sp  index sp  primarily to economically hedge the equity risk of the mortality and expense fees in its variable annuity products these contracts provide periodic payments to the company in exchange for the pl table of contents     total return of the sp  in the form of a payment or receipt depending on whether the return relative to the index on trade date is positive or negative respectively     va riders on new variable annuity contracts issued since january   are partially covered by reinsurance these reinsurance arrangements are used to offset a portion of the company’s exposure to the va riders for the lives of the host variable annuity contracts issued since january   the ceded portion of the va riders is considered an embedded derivative and is recorded in other assets or other liabilities as either a reinsurance recoverable or reinsurance payable       the decrease in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives net of reinsurance and net of the results of the variable annuity hedging strategies which includes periodic derivative settlements resulted in before dac and pretax unrealized gains losses of  million  million and  million for the years ended december    and  respectively which were recorded as a

provides certain indemnifications related to other dispositions acquisitions investments lease agreements or other transactions that are triggered by among other things breaches of representations warranties or covenants provided by the company these obligations are typically subject to time limitations that vary in duration including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law such as applicable statutes of limitation because the amounts of these types of indemnifications often are not explicitly stated the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated the company has not historically made material payments for these types of indemnifications the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments under these obligations is not determinable due to the lack of a stated maximum liability for certain matters and therefore no related liability has been recorded management believes that judgments if any against the company related to such matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements       most of the jurisdictions in which the company
