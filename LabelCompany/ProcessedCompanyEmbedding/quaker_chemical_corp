specialty high performance lubricants specifically engineered for the mining environment   featured minetech™ products include   cst drive synthetic gear oils – minetech™ cst  recommended for highly loaded enclosed gearing as well as plain and rolling element bearings this shear stable lubricant resists damage to gear teeth caused by repeated shock loads and is ideal for wind turbine gearboxes mine hoist gearboxes crane gearing and other enclosed gearing which requires micropitting resistance     synthetic gear oils – minetech™ ep a series of gear lubricants formulated with synthetic pao base fluids proven to reduce friction thus reducing the input power to operate the equipment or increasing the available power output the reduction of fluid friction results in lower lubricant operating temperatures extending the life of both the lubricant and the equipment these products were developed for the lubrication of enclosed gears which are heavily loaded plain or roller element     semifluid synthetic gear oils and greases – minetech™ lstep designed for various industrial gear applications it is formulated to reduce fluid related problems and should be used in extreme conditions where a conventional gear lubricant may not offer sufficient lubrication due to the semisolid being active when the product is stationary and not being sheared it will not leak out of the gearbox the product itself seals in the lubricant and seals out the contaminants this also offers resistance to water incursion and provides superior protection against corrosion and oxidation which can eat away and destroy critical components and lead to equipment failure   protech™ high performance synthetic metalworking fluids designed for various industrial and air compressor applications   featured protech™ products include   synthetic air compressor lubricants – protech™ ac series lubricants manufactured from the highest quality pao polyalphaolefin base fluids and incorporate advanced additive technology protech ac series lubricants offer many advantages over petroleumbased lubricants as well as some synthetics – especially where compatibility is an important concern   recommended applications include centrifugal compressors rotary screw compressors ball and roller element bearings low temperature lubrication and high temperature lubrication     synthetic gear lubricants – protech™ ep series synthetic gear lubricants formulated with synthetic pao base fluids and fortified with select additive systems to enhance their exceptional performance the pao base fluid has excellent oxidation and thermal stability a naturally high viscosity index and excellent low temperature pumpability and fluidity the additive system provides increased oxidation stability extreme pressure properties and maximum protection against wear rust corrosion and foaming   quaker protech™ ep series synthetic gear lubricants have proven to reduce friction reducing the input power to operate the equipment or increasing the available power output the reduction of fluid friction results in lower lubricant operating temperatures extending the life of both the lubricant and the equipment quaker circulating oil a series of products containing high quality high viscosity index oils recommended for the lubrication of oilfilm bearings on backup rolls in metal rolling mills  they are designed to meet the specifications of bearing manufacturers quakervis™ a complete line of hydraulic fluid formulated from highquality base oils and carefully selected additive systems to offer outstanding thermal stability quakervis™ oils are available in both zinc containing and ashless zinc free versions quakerway™ premium line of way oils that incorporates a unique tackiness additive and a high performance lubricant additive system   ultragear™ industrial gear lubricants – ultragear™ ep series premium gear lubricants formulated with high quality base oils and an effective sulfurphosphorous ep extreme pressure additive system designed to minimize wear of enclosed gears and other equipment operating under heavy loads and shock conditions they utilize high viscosity index hvi base oils that impart high flash points low volatility and superior oxidation stability they provide outstanding protection in industrial gear sets operating under severe conditions such as intermittent shock loads high peak loads and heavy tooth loads     food grade gear oils ultragear™ is formulated to protect moving parts in bearings light duty gearboxes as a coating oil chain lubricant food machinery and applications where a friction reducing antiwear oil is required unimist™ high performance mist oils formulated with synthetic base stocks and proprietary additive technology to provide maximum protection under severe operating conditions   related content quaker  company overview subscribe to quaker forum enewsletter   videos industry expertise our solutions
