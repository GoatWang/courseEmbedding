antidepressants antiemetics metoclopramide anticholinergic medications benztropine antihistamines antiepileptics antiparkinsonian drugs estrogenbased hormonal therapy stimulants methylphenidate and many more ingrezza is no doubt better than tetrabenazine another vmat inhibitor and the only recommended td treatment on the market however tetrabenazine is used offlabel for td as it is only approved in the us for chorea associated with huntington disease hd tetrabenazine became available in generic this year ending the  orphan exclusivity years of lundbecks otcpkhluyy xenazine for hd chorea xenazine generated revenue in the us of dkk  million around  million  million and  million in   and  respectively a metaanalysis estimated an overall hd prevalence of  per  in north america and europe other experts view this as a gross underestimation and insist on a trend of increasing hd prevalence in most caucasian populations as hd patients live longer due to better treatments even in the base case there wouldve been  hd patients according to the  us census it is apparent from table  and succeeding sales figures that xenazine never achieved a  market penetration table  xenazine usbased annual sales and demand xenazine     revenues in  millions     growth    patients     growth    before the fda approved xenazine in  americans often resorted to importing generic tetrabenazine from

usually need higher doses of xenazine than is effective for chorea ingrezza and tetrabenazine are both prodrugs that when metabolized produce the therapeutic drug αdihydrotetrabenazine however unlike tetrabenazine ingrezza does not spawn other active metabolites such as  βdihydrotetrabenazine that may cause toxic effects like sedation and parkinsonism in april ingrezza should also become the first approved agent for td the nda includes the results from the kinect  and kinect  td studies along with the results from another  clinical trials kinect  had been discussed in the previous article kinect  was a phase  doubleblind parallel randomized placebocontrolled trial rct in  td patients the primary endpoint table  showed that the abnormal involuntary movement scale aims ratings at week

area is usually sufficient for a td diagnosis baseline aims scores averaged  standard deviation  for illustrative purposes the results may be interpreted as ingrezza  mg being able to potentially alleviate  areas to minimal td or ingrezza  mg reducing  areas in a sample patient having mild td in  categories even if ingrezzas label is limited to moderate or severe cases again it is easy to see how a hypothetical patient with  moderate areas could be managed down to all mild determining the market for ingrezza is difficult perhaps the best approximation can be made from a study that examined recent trends in month prevalence of receipt of mental health treatments among adults  years or older from  generations the silent generation born in the years  the baby boomers born in the years  and generation x born in the years  nationally representative data was gathered from  participants in the  national surveys on drug use and health nsduh nsduh did exclude homeless persons not in shelters activeduty military personnel and residents of institutional quarters such as nursing homes in general younger people adopt a more tolerant view of mental health problems and treatments so its not surprising that the estimated prevalence of selfreported mental illness was found to be highest among gen xers and lowest among the silent generation see table  on the other hand medicare part d is available for a sizable fraction of baby boomers and others of appropriate age in addition the affordable care act of  reduced prescription copays for generics in  and for brandname in  when part d patients hit the donut hole which is the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophiccoverage threshold thus not only did a larger proportion of baby boomers receive psychotropic medications they were the only cohort in focus for which receipt of psychotropic medications increased over time from  in  to  in   p   table  twelvemonth prevalence of mental illness mi  and modeladjusted unless otherwise specified other adults generation x baby boomers silent generation overall adult participants       prevalence of mi  unadjusted      prevalence of mi      patients with pastyear mi receiving psychotropics      pastyear mi receiving psychotropics     received psychotropic medications       the researchers noted that psychotropic use increased overall by   to  p   their main point was that older cohorts had limited access to mental health treatment one can be easily eyeballed from table  that most adults born from  to the mids and had mental health problems the previous year were able to receive psychotropic medications it has been established that the cumulative incidence of td during the first  years of antipsychotic treatment increases linearly with the duration of exposure to offending drugs the debate still rages on whether atypical at least secondgeneration antipsychotics really have fewer propensities to cause td compared to firstgeneration antipsychotics fgas in a naturalistic study of  patients a  td prevalence was observed in those exposed only to atypicals which was statistically identical in those taking fgas for the first  years odds ratio  some sources have pegged td prevalence of up to  and annual td incidence of  per  patient years of exposure to fgas as well as an alarmingly similar rate of  per  patient years with atypicals with the current us population a flat  puts the number at  million adult americans on antipsychotics of whom  or  million are suffering from td alternatively using population frequency distribution by generations leads to a slightly smaller estimate of  million with td finally the prevalence of moderate td is  of td patients or about  of patients treated with neuroleptics using the lower alternative estimate ingrezzas market is either at least  with the first formula or more than  million with the latter these figures agree with the range of managements claims ingrezza will also enjoy firsttomarket advantage in td over rival deutetrabenazine sd from teva pharmaceutical industries nyseteva which reported positive topline results for aimtd last month aimtd is deutetrabenazines registrational phase  rct for td deutetrabenazine shares xenazines structure but substitutes  hydrogens with  deuterium atoms which extends deutetrabenazines half life and reduce interactions with other drugs but just as teva touts a convenience benefit for deutetrabenazines twice daily dosing compared to xenazines occasional  times a day frequency ingrezza trumps both with a single daily dose a critical advantage for patients who may have difficulties swallowing or handling small items neurocrine had  million in liquid assets as of june  and burned  million in q so it is wellfunded to launch ingrezza the company may be able to get away with charging  per  mg of ingrezza which compares favorably with xenazine  mg at  each in  and  today if so with each  penetration of the td market ingrezza will deliver at least  million it is not difficult to imagine  of  patients  afflicted with at least moderate td after waiting years for an approved td or one that insurance was willing to cover would want to at least try ingrezza what remains to be seen is whether neurocrine can hold off tevas much larger sales force but ingrezza may be able to earn several hundred million in revenue
