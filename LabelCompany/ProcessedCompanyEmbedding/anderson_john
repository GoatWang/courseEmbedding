español brought to you by search printnew thirdgeneration product b september   john anderson pictured here in his lab recently released the nextgeneration development of product b the release of product b™ antioxidants plus telomere support launched isagenix into the scientific world’s growing quest to combat aging from the inside out it’s been more than a year and thousands worldwide have already begun to feel and show the benefits of taking product b—increased energy improved fitness and a general feeling of youthfulness and vigor “the changes are both visible and invisible but the biggest is that i’ve lost all semblance of age if it weren’t for my driver’s license i’d feel like i was  i have more energy and every day i feel more and more alive” said peter greenlaw an isagenix associate and product b user never one to rest on his laurels isagenix founder and product b formulator john anderson has been working tirelessly to continually improve the efficacy of his groundbreaking telomeresupporting formula and now with the newly introduced third generation of product b at celebration  the evidence is clear that anderson has made significant strides in the product’s ability to support telomere health telomeres play a large part in healthy aging as the protective dna sequences at the end of each chromosome telomeres are the difference between accelerated aging and normal or what some would call “youthful aging” as cells divide the length of telomeres shorten until finally the cell can no longer divide and the signs of aging begin to appear “how we live—diet exercise stress and exposure to toxins—has a tremendous influence on the overall health and length of our telomeres” said anderson earlier in the year at the isagenix top achievers event in april anderson touched on the future impact of product b detailing his first visit with bill andrews phd—the molecular biologist antiaging crusader and anderson’s collaborator in the testing and vetting process anderson recalls their conversation “bill said ‘we use a control that actually turns on the gene that expresses telomerase it’s very strong and very potent but it’s not for human consumption’ this answered my next question which was why it wasn’t on the market” dr andrews’s tests involve running anderson’s natural ingredients through a machine that measures whether or not an ingredient produces a hit which is the equivalent of inducing telomerase the machine does this by comparing the test ingredients against a control that turns on telomerase activity unfortunately for humans that control is too toxic for consumption “i wanted to have a hit as big as the control” anderson shared “bill told me it was impossible—the control was so strong we were never going to see a hit like that in a natural botanical” loving a challenge anderson sent dr andrews  to  vials every week for screening all dr andrews knew about the vials was that they differed somewhat in ingredients and potency anderson’s hard work finally paid off with an exciting phone call from dr andrews in early march “you’ve exceeded our control i can’t believe it what are you doing over there” andrews said over the phone visibly emotional anderson said he gets “goosebumps” thinking about what the thirdgeneration of product b will do for consumers “for every batch we try to improve and increase the potency and efficacy so we get more telomere support” he said “what does this mean for all of you as telomere research evolves and we discover new technologies and ways to prepare the ingredients they’re going to make their way into the product and you’re going to reap all the amazing benefits” “i’m really proud that we’ve come this far we’ve been able to prove that we can do more than scientists ever thought we’d be able to do isagenix is in its eleventh year of business and i wonder what we’ll do in the next  to  years—even six months to a year from now i tell you its mindboggling and i am more than excited to me this is the beginning of the beginning” said anderson these improvements have been shown to induce telomerase in vitro in vitro lab results may not be indicative of in vivo results for optimal telomere benefit product b is intended to be taken as part of an isagenix system related posts science behind “living forever” questions about justlaunched product b study

recognize the law and authority of jesus christ over the united states the bills died quietly but came back to haunt anderson in his presidential candidacy as he continued to serve the atmosphere of the s weighed on anderson and he began to rethink some of his beliefs by the late s andersons positions on social issues shifted to the left though his fiscal philosophy remained largely conservative at the same time he was held in high esteem by his colleagues in the house in  he won appointment to a seat on the powerful rules committee in  he became chairman of the house republican conference

presidential campaign anderson lost a key ally in washington in late  a fundamentalist television minister from rockford don lyon announced that he would challenge anderson in the republican primary it was a contentious campaign where lyon with his experience before the camera proved to be a formidable candidate lyon raised a great deal of money won backing from many conservatives in the

social security taxes anderson built state campaigns in four targeted states—new hampshire massachusetts illinois and wisconsin he won some political support among republicans picking up endorsements along the way that helped legitimize him in the race he began to build support among media elites who appreciated his articulateness straightforward manner moderate positions and his refusal to walk

candidates debate in des moines iowa on january  unlike the others he said lowering taxes increasing defense spending and balancing the budget were an impossible combination in a stirring summation anderson invoked his fathers emigration to the united states and said that we would have to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow for the next week andersons name and face were all over the national news programs in newspapers and in national news magazines anderson spent less than  in the state but he finished with  of the vote the television networks were covering the event portraying anderson to a national audience as a man of character and principle when the voters in new hampshire went to the polls anderson again exceeded the expectations finishing fourth with just under  of the vote anderson was declared the winner in both massachusetts and vermont by the associated press but in the wee hours of the morning ended up losing both primaries by an eyelash in massachusetts he lost to george bush by  and in vermont he lost to reagan by  votes nonetheless anderson was now a toptier candidate in the republican race and for the first time a true contender for the nomination the next major primary for anderson was in illinois his home state he arrived there after his new england triumph and had a lead in the state polls but his illinois campaign struggled despite endorsements from the states two largest newspapers his campaign no longer taken lightly by his opponents was outmatched organizationally and he was ganged up upon in a candidates debate reagan defeated him  to  anderson carried chicago and rockford the states two largest cities at the time but he was clobbered in the southern section of the state the next week there was a primary in connecticut which while anderson was on the ballot his team had chosen not to campaign actively in while this strategy of bypassing the event had worked for him in some southern primaries as a front runner he no longer could pick and choose his campaigns he finished third in connecticut with  of the vote and it seemed to most like any other loss whether anderson said he was competing or not next

anderson campaign button the republican platform failed to endorse the equal rights amendment or support extension of time for its ratification anderson was a strong supporter of both pollsters were finding that anderson was much more popular across the country with all voters than he was in the republican primary states without any campaigning he was running at  nationally in a threeway race anderson’s personal aide and confidant tom wartowski encouraged him to remain in the republican party anderson faced a huge number of obstacles as a nonmajor party candidate having to qualify for  ballots which the major parties appeared on automatically having to raise money to run a campaign the major parties received close to  million in government money for their campaigns having to win national coverage having to build a campaign overnight and having to find a suitable running mate among them initially anderson did very well as an independent he built a new campaign team qualified for every ballot raised a great deal of money and rose in the polls to as high as  in a gallup poll but the summer was cruel to anderson he had an overseas campaign tour to show his foreign policy credentials and it took a drubbing on national television the major parties particularly the republicans basked in the spotlight of their national conventions where anderson was left out of the coverage anderson made an appearance with ted kennedy and it too was a huge error by the third week of august he was in the – range in the polls anderson again recovered and went on a modest spree of successes a critical issue for him was appearing in the fall presidential debates after the league of women voters invited him to appear due to popular interest in his candidacy although he was only polling  at that time in late august he named patrick lucey the former twoterm democratic governor of wisconsin and ambassador to mexico as his running mate late in august anderson released a page comprehensive platform under the banner of the national unity party that was very well received in early september a court challenge to federal election campaign act was successful and anderson qualified for postelection public funding also anderson submitted his petitions for his fiftyfirst ballot then the league ruled that the polls showed that he had met the qualification threshold and said he would appear in the debates falledit this set off a controversy carter said that he would not appear on stage with anderson and sat out the debate which hurt the president in the eyes of voters reagan and anderson had a debate in baltimore on september   anderson did well and polls showed he won a modest debate victory over reagan but reagan who had been portrayed by carter throughout the campaign as something of a warmonger proved to be a reasonable candidate and carried himself well in the debate the debate was andersons big opportunity he needed a breakout performance but what he got was a modest victory in the following weeks anderson slowly faded out of the picture with his support dropping from  to – in the first half of october by the end of the month reagan debated carter alone and andersons support continued to fade although reagan would win a sizable victory the polls showed the two major party candidates closer gallups final poll was –– going into the election and it was clear that many wouldbe anderson supporters were now supporting their second choice in the end anderson finished with just under  of the vote most of andersons original support came from rockefeller republicans who were more liberal than reagan but it bled away many prominent intellectuals including all in the family creator norman lear and the editors of the liberal magazine the new republic also endorsed the anderson campaign he also had the support of many independents cartoonist garry trudeaus doonesbury ran several strips sympathetic to the anderson campaign according to the recently published journals of arthur m schlesinger jr former first lady jacqueline kennedy onassis voted for anderson as did schlesinger himself although the carter campaign feared anderson could be a spoiler andersons campaign turned out to be simply another option for frustrated voters who had already decided not to back carter for another term polls found anderson voters nearly as likely to list reagan as their second choice as carter anderson did not carry a single precinct in the country anderson’s finish was still the best showing for a third party candidate since george wallace’s  percent in  and stands as the seventh best for any such candidate since the civil war trailing james b weaver’s  percent in  theodore roosevelt’s  percent in  robert la follette’s  percent in  wallace and ross perot’s  percent and  percent in  and  respectively he pursued ohios refusal to provide ballot access to the us supreme court and won – in anderson v celebrezze his

anderson’s personal aide and confidant tom wartowski encouraged him to remain in the republican party anderson faced a huge number of obstacles as a nonmajor party candidate having to qualify for  ballots which the major parties appeared on automatically having to raise money to run a campaign the major parties received close to  million in government money for their campaigns having to win national coverage having to build a campaign overnight and having to find a suitable running mate among them initially anderson did very well as an independent he built a new campaign team qualified for every ballot raised a great deal of money and rose in the polls to as high as  in a gallup poll but the summer was cruel to anderson he had an overseas campaign tour to show his foreign policy credentials and it took a drubbing on national television the major parties particularly the republicans basked in the spotlight of their national conventions where anderson was left out of the coverage anderson made an appearance with ted kennedy and it too was a huge error by the third week of august he was in the – range in the polls anderson again recovered and went on a modest spree of successes a critical issue for him was appearing in the fall presidential debates after the league of women voters invited him to appear due to popular interest in his candidacy although he was only polling  at that time in late august he named patrick lucey the former twoterm democratic governor of wisconsin and ambassador to mexico as his running mate late in august anderson released a page comprehensive platform under the banner of the national unity party that was very well received in early september a court challenge to federal election campaign act was successful and anderson qualified for postelection public funding also anderson submitted his petitions for his fiftyfirst ballot then the league ruled that the polls showed that he had met the qualification threshold and said he would appear in the debates falledit this set off a controversy carter said that he would not appear on stage with anderson and sat out the debate which hurt the president in the eyes of voters reagan and anderson had a debate in baltimore on september   anderson did well and polls showed he won a modest debate victory over reagan but reagan who had been portrayed by carter throughout the campaign as something of a warmonger proved to be a reasonable candidate and carried himself well in the debate the debate was andersons big opportunity he needed a breakout performance but what he got was a modest victory in the following weeks anderson slowly faded out of the picture with his support dropping from  to – in the first half of october by the end of the month reagan debated carter alone and andersons support continued to fade although reagan would win a sizable victory the polls showed the two major party candidates closer gallups final poll was –– going into the election and it was clear that many wouldbe anderson supporters were now supporting their second choice in the end anderson finished with just under  of the vote most of andersons original support came from rockefeller republicans who were more liberal than reagan but it bled away many prominent intellectuals including all in the family creator norman lear and the editors of the liberal magazine the new republic also endorsed the anderson campaign he also had the support of many independents cartoonist garry trudeaus doonesbury ran several strips sympathetic to the anderson campaign according to the recently published journals of arthur m schlesinger jr former first lady jacqueline kennedy onassis voted for anderson as did schlesinger himself although the carter campaign feared anderson could be a spoiler andersons campaign turned out to be simply another option for frustrated voters who had already decided not to back carter for another term polls found anderson voters nearly as likely to list reagan as their second choice as carter anderson did not carry a single precinct in the country anderson’s finish was still the best showing for a third party candidate since george wallace’s  percent in  and stands as the seventh best for any such candidate since the civil war trailing james b weaver’s  percent in  theodore roosevelt’s  percent in  robert la follette’s  percent in  wallace and ross perot’s  percent and  percent in  and  respectively he pursued ohios refusal to provide ballot access to the us supreme court and won – in anderson v celebrezze his inability to make headway against the de facto twoparty system as an independent in that election would later lead him to become an advocate for instantrunoff voting helping to found fairvote in citation needed later careeredit anderson speaking in  by the end of the campaign andersons support came mostly from college students he capitalized on that by becoming a visiting professor at a series of universities stanford university university of southern california duke university university of illinois college of law brandeis university bryn mawr college oregon state university university of massachusetts amherst and nova southeastern university his most recent postcitation needed and giving the lecture at the  waldo family lecture on international relations at old dominion university he was chair of fairvote from  to  and continues to serve on its board served as president of the world federalist association and on the advisory board of public campaign and the electronic privacy information center and is of counsel to the washington dcbased law firm of greenberg  lieberman llc he was the first executive director of the council for the national interest founded in  by former congressmen paul findley ril and pete mccloskey rca to promote american interests in the middle east in the  us presidential election he was briefly considered as possible candidate for the reform party nomination but instead endorsed ralph nader in january  anderson indicated strong support for the candidacy of fellow illinoisan democratic contender barack obama in  he
