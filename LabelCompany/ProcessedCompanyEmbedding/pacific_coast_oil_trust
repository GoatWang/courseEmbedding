which these net profits interests were conveyed the underlying properties consist of i proved developed reserves referred to as the “developed properties” and ii all other development potential on the underlying properties referred to as the “remaining properties”production from the developed properties that will be attributable to the trust is produced from wells that because they have already been drilled require limited additional capital expenditures as a result the developed properties are projected to have positive net profits immediately upon conveyance to the trust production from the remaining properties that will be attributable to the trust will require capital expenditures for the drilling of wells and installation of infrastructure pcec will supply required capital on behalf of the trust during this period however because the costs initially incurred will exceed gross proceeds the remaining properties will have negative net profits during the drilling and development period during this period of negative net profits instead of being paid net profits the trust will be paid a  overriding royalty on the portion of the remaining properties located on pcec’s orcutt properties once revenues from the remaining properties have paid back pcec for the cumulative costs it has advanced on behalf of the trust then the net profits interests on the remaining properties will be paid out in place of the royalty interests as described below we refer to the net profits interests and royalty interest conveyed to the trust as the “net profits interests” and “royalty interest” respectively these interests which we refer to collectively as the “conveyed interests” entitle the trust to receive the followingdeveloped properties        of the net profits from
