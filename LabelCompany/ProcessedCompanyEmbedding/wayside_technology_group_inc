wayside technology groupsep   about wayside technology wstg brian grosso deep valuesummaryi made a nice profit due to my initial sale prior to the pullback and the dividend in a down market but my analysis was overoptimistic in hindsightthe various issues with my analysis are primarily due to the same acute thing that causes most of my errors speed i found the stock researched and wrote ina week or two that does not allow for much thought reflection or opposing perspective turtles my name for a reason  its crucial to make investment decisions slowlythis article also explores wstg in the context of my portfolio positioning and view on us equities ideas cant be assessed in a vacuumholding narrative i originally recommended and purchased shares of wayside technology group nasdaqwstg on february th of this year at share and wrote a long sa article explaining the rationale for that purchase on that date id taken a  position all of which was within my roth ira due wstg paying a large dividend i sold half of the position on june th at a very nice annualized return as indicated by the red star in the below image because it had gone up a fair amount fairly quickly and id already begun questioning my assumptions at this point the stock has pulled back since and is up just a little bit since february on a total return basis albeit outperforming the market by a good margin for several companyspecific and idiosyncratic reasons i think now is a good time for me to get out completely too aggressive on margin and multiple looking back i was too aggressive on several of the most important assumptions that drove my valuation heres the original valuation calculation for one i didnt use a probability tree i acknowledge in the article that the valuation represents a bullish scenario which implies that worse things can happen but i didnt explicitly state or quantify those worse things or include them in my valuation in other words i tacitly said that the above represented the best thing that could happen but then also argued that that is what i expected to happen rather than averaging out multiple future realities as the logically sound who cannot predict the future good human investors do this really just represents development on my part im still young and figuring out how i want to think about value ive got a  ebitda margin there even though the business had averaged under  in the  years prior the number had been declining for  years and was at  on a trailing basis at the time my rationale for margin improvement was rather weak  reversion to the mean and the company getting larger and scaling fixed costs like public company costs i assumed a x evebit multiple assuming a  tax rate and no debt this equates to a x pe while this seems reasonable for a decent business considering it is a good bit below market it assumed pretty significant improvement from what the stock was at then  x since then ive become much more wary of assuming large multiple expansions its just not very conservative because market perception is market perception and multiples are kind of out of my control do i want to get all the projections right and still earn a lousy return because the market continues to be less optimistic about a company than i am relying on multiple expansions for the bulk of returns is not dependable and does not give you as much control over outcomes in terms of your analysis so ive toned that down as well to a weighted x the updated valuation is below some of the other assumptions will be further covered later on unfair comparison a key component of my thesis was that margins should improve and evebit multiple increase because wstgs peers were earning higher margins and valued higher thats a fair argument if theyre fair comps but im not sure they are to see i did some research on ingram micro nyseim wstgs largest peer and incidentally a company that heavily recruits at my college i came across an excellent article on value investors club wayside is a distributor and reseller primarily of software ingram micro also distributes technology products but distributes more hardware than software and this is only one of its business segments this is problematic for two reasons for one the primary bear argument on the distributionvar industry is that it will be disintermediated by the cloud however some basic thought indicates that not all distributorsvars will be impacted equally more companies will download programs via the internet or access the program via the cloud with the actual program running centrally but these end users will still need hardware locally if not quite as new or powerful i interned over the summer at a large bank and as part of the onboarding process had to get set up with the technology id be using i was given a computer keyboard several monitors etc i also had to download a lot of software some like microsoft office was downloaded after i gained access via the companys technology marketplace however most others were never downloaded i gained access to the program through the marketplace but then just accessed it using a user interface in the browser in other words most of the software was already in the cloud proprietary or not i think software will be hit much harder and quicker and that means wstg will be hit harder and quicker than its peers second ims consolidated margins dont reflect the margins it is earning on its distributorvar activities since it does much more than that expansion into faster growthhigher margin services ingram micro has recently been expanding into new business that are higher margin and faster growing than its core technology solutions businesses technology services a  margin business growing at    annually in fact the core distributorvar business seems to be earning the lowest margins of the bunch at  ebit margin as stated by the author incidentally thats a good chunk lower than what wstg is earning now put simply the comparison in my original analysis was not apples to apples and that enabled some misplaced optimism misidentification in my original article i got a little wrapped up in the technology expertise component of wstgs business and said things like distributors like wayside get all of the benefits of these secular tailwinds without the typical product developmentobsolescence risks it is important to remember that wstg is not a technology company though its primary business activities are sales and customer service i should have realized this when in my first article i detailed the story about ceo simon nynens and the bell he had installed at the company to ensure incoming calls were answered promptly it was drilled in again though in the q call when evp bill botti said so phoenix being the largest call center city in the country i believe with many many major corporations here the opportunity for talent is much larger so we already have people in the office working call centers are a big part of wstg and that just doesnt strike me as a terribly high quality business i can read all about a business and what its grown at and earned on invested capital but no matter what my appraisal of the quality of the business is driven in large part by the few things i anchor on as being core to the business model in the case of wstg i anchored on technology  what theyre moving instead of call centers  what theyre doing and that resulted in a misappraisal not a serious response to cloud i just read this article titled wheres the value going to be in value added resellers it is about the declining value proposition of vars and what must be done to stay relevant below is an excerpt hayes whose father was a turnaround ceo tells me that his team came to this stark conclusion in  it wasnt that hard to see our clients were telling us wed be out of business in  months if we didnt add more value hayes took the initiative and began to dramatically reshape the company the team realized that in order to add value they needed a different staff profile and mix they moved from  engineering to sales ratio to a  ratio today the radical shift toward expertise and away from sales makes sense the actual distribution of product is easier now and adding expertisereducing sales allows vars to engage customers in a more mutually beneficial manner weve not seen this kind of dramatic response to the secular changes at wstg yes the company is more a distributor than a var but again its all channel and i dont think the response should be much different wstg has invested in virtual distribution but this hasnt gotten much attention on conference calls so unless management is being modest it doesnt seem overly significant and the company is actually increasing the size of its salesforce with the new teams and arizona office tactical asset allocation the biggest factor impacting my decision to consider closing my wstg position is actually not companyspecific it has to do with my desire to position myself to capitalize when better opportunities in the us market appear as i said in my article a time to act fearful i think now is a good time to be heavy on cash and maintain very high absolute criteria on individual ideas in my pa i could use some more cash and im not sure wstg still fits that very high criteria should i really be  in something that i now only think will deliver a  return over  years with risk of some capital impairment when my goal at the outset is yr returns and minimalno impairment potential and at a time when i want to have plenty of cash i think the answer is no to hold or not to hold ultimately i think that wstg is still a good idea that i expect to deliver above market returns over the next few years but i was overoptimistic at the outset as is so often the case for me because of the way my brain is wired time has given me the chance to develop a more objective system  understanding of the company and idea that and a more conservative view on us equities and the way i want to be positioned result in my decision to close my position hopefully this is an interesting lesson on the mental biases impacting initial research viewing investment ideas in the context of opportunity costs and the portfolio they sit in and wstg itself disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
