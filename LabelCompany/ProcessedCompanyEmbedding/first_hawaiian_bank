expenses payable by the bnpp selling stockholder will be received by the bnpp selling stockholder a subsidiary of bnpp the financial services industry is highly competitive many of the institutions we compete against also have deep roots in hawaii and have developed longstanding reputations in the communities they serve within our branch footprint we primarily face competition from regional banks that have established branch networks throughout the islands giving them visible retail presence to customers however we also compete with national financial institutions that operate in our market areas competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition in consumer banking we primarily compete with local banks that have visible retail presence and personnel in our market areas the primary factors driving competition in consumer banking are customer service interest rates fees charged branch location and hours of operation and the range of products offered we compete for deposits by advertising offering competitive interest rates and seeking to provide a higher level of personal service our wealth management business faces competition from both nonbank brokerage firms and larger financial institution brokerage businesses in commercial banking we face competition to source loans to healthy stable businesses at competitive price levels that make sense for our business some competitors may offer a wider variety of products or may specialize in an industry that allows them to provide a concentrated focus that is not part of our business model our major commercial bank competitors include large financial institutions including national and international financial institutions that may have the ability to bid on larger commercial real estate and construction projects than we can bid on our regional competitors may have aggressive pricing and unique terms we compete on a number of factors including among others customer service range of products offered price reputation quality of execution and relative lending limits pertaining to commercial borrowers company description we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware and headquartered in honolulu hawaii our whollyowned bank subsidiary first hawaiian bank was founded in  under the name bishop  company

share position across our branch footprint as of june   we had a  deposit market share in hawaii a  deposit market share in guam and a  deposit market share in saipan according to the federal deposit
