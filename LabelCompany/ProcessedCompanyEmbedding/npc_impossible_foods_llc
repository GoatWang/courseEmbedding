who what and how below and if you still have questions send them our way qa what is impossible foods founded by patrick o brown md phd impossible foods is a silicon valley startup on a mission to make the global food system more sustainable the fastgrowing team includes scientists engineers chefs farmers and foodies the first product is the impossible burger it tastes great  and you can feel great about it because the impossible burger is made entirely from plants how did the company get started we started in  with a simple question “why does meat taste like meat” we spent the next five years researching every aspect of the unique sensory experience of meat from how it looks raw to how it sizzles and what happens when we sink our teeth into a burger then we recreated the precise flavors textures aromas and nutrition of ground beef  using only plants by understanding meat at the molecular level we made a juicy burger that’s delicious yet nutritious why do you make only ground beef our first product to hit the market is the impossible burger but we’re not stopping there we are already developing other types of meat and dairy our team of scientists and food researchers can make chicken pork fish or yogurt entirely from plants we will bring other products to market according to regional food preferences and customer demand worldwide the impossible burger is only the beginning what exactly is it made of the impossible burger is made from simple ingredients found in nature including wheat coconut oil and potatoes we add one more special ingredient called “heme” heme contributes to the characteristic color and taste of meat and it catalyzes all the other flavors when meat is cooked heme is exceptionally abundant in animal muscle  and it’s a basic building block of life in all organisms including plants we discovered how to take heme from plants and produce it using fermentation  similar to the method that’s been used to make belgian beer for nearly a thousand years adding heme to the impossible burger makes it a carnivore’s delight full ingredient list water textured wheat protein coconut oil potato protein natural flavors  or less of leghemoglobin soy yeast extract salt soy protein isolate konjac gum xanthan gum thiamin vitamin b zinc niacin vitamin b riboflavin vitamin b vitamin b contains soy wheat do you produce heme by genetic modification yes we genetically engineer yeast to make a key ingredient heme the process allows us to produce the impossible burger at scale with the lowest achievable environmental impact we start with the gene for a protein called leghemoglobin a heme protein that is naturally found in the root nodules of soy plants leghemoglobin is similar to myoglobin the heme protein that is exceptionally abundant in animal muscles binds oxygen and gives meat its unique flavor and aroma as well as its red or pink color we add the soy leghemoglobin gene to a yeast strain and grow the yeast via fermentation then we isolate the leghemoglobin or heme from the yeast we add heme to the impossible burger to give it the intense meaty flavor aroma and cooking properties of animal meat by producing our heme in yeast we avoid digging up soy plants to harvest the root nodules which would promote erosion and release carbon stored in the soil this enables us to produce heme sustainably at high volume and make plantbased meat for millions of people offsetting the environmental impact of animal agriculture besides the yeast used to make heme do you use other genetically modified crops no we currently buy soy wheat and potatoes from certified nongmo sources is it vegan glutenfree impossible burgers are  vegan they include wheat protein which means they contain gluten where can i eat the burger were currently serving the impossible burger at select restaurants in new york la las vegas texas and san francisco go to our ‘locations’ page for more info can i buy the impossible burger in grocery stores or online we are not yet available in grocery stores or for online ordering we are starting by working with worldclass chefs to ensure the best possible experience for our customers as we ramp up our supply we intend to be accessible and available widely can i buy the impossible burger internationally the impossible burger is only available in select restaurants in the united states we are currently focusing on wider availability in the us and will be available internationally in the coming years why is the impossible burger not more widely available we want to get the impossible burger in the hands of as many people as possible but it takes time to build something new we are working around the clock to build our production facilities to get you and many others an impossible burger very soon thank you for being patient with us as we grow why is the impossible burger better for the planet it takes a lot of land water food and time for cows to turn plants into meat and by basically skipping the biggest step in the plantstocowstoburgers equation we save a lot of resources compared to a burger made from cows making an impossible burger uses about th the land th the water and produces th the greenhouse gas emissions where do our environmental numbers come from we use what’s called a life cycle assessment lca—an estimate of a product’s full environmental impact from raw material to finished product—that allows us to compare it to us beef production however because beef production methods vary so do our estimates our next step is to bring our lca into compliance with standards from the international organization for standardization iso this year as we put the finishing touches on our new manufacturing facilities and supply chain we’re working with our sustainability consulting partners to get this started how good is the impossible burger for me the plantbased impossible burger delivers bioavailable protein and iron comparable to conventional beef it has no cholesterol hormones or antibiotics have more questions we love questions after all we were founded by a professoremail protected get more information and a full list of pressinvestor faqs download

anchor chef in new york said patrick o brown md phd founder and ceo of impossible foods under davids skilled hand the impossible burger is moving to the next level of taste the impossible burger looks cooks smells sizzles and tastes like conventional ground beef but is made entirely from plants among the breakthroughs that make the impossible burger unique is the discovery that a molecule called heme is the magic ingredient that makes meat look cook and taste gloriously meaty while heme is exceptionally abundant in meat it is a basic molecular building block of life on earth including plants impossible foods uses a plantbased heme protein to give the impossible burger its irresistibly meaty taste i was genuinely blown away when i tasted the burger said chef and founder of momofuku david chang the impossible foods team has discovered how to reengineer what makes beef taste like beef were always looking to support people who are making the best products in the best ways possible and to me the impossible burger is one more example first and foremost we think this makes a delicious burger momofukus first restaurant on the west side of manhattan momofuku nishi will serve a limited

a martins potato roll with shoestring fries guests may also add cheese upon request impossible foodss mission is to produce delicious nutritious affordable plantbased foods with a lower environmental impact than raising animals for food producing the impossible burger requires approximately a quarter of the water used to produce the same burger from a cow a twentieth of the land and only an eighth of the greenhouse gas emissions according to a lifecycle analysis conducted by impossible foods two factors have made the impossible burger as good as it is said harold mcgee author of on food and cooking the science and lore of the kitchen and other works about food science and its history one is impossible foodss ambition to make a plantbased burger thats just as delicious as a beef burger with the same satisfying flavors and textures the other is its pursuit of a deeper scientific understanding of meat itself and how cooking makes it delicious this research effort has generated major new insights into the flavor of meat and continues to drive the innovations that put the impossible burger in a category of its own the impossible burgers key ingredients are water wheat protein coconut oil potato protein and leghemoglobin ie heme plus natural flavors and micronutrients the impossible burger delivers comparable protein and iron to conventional beef but contains no cholesterol hormones or antibiotics later this year the impossible burger is also expected to become a regularly featured menu item at select restaurants in san francisco and los angeles  the company plans to expand to additional restaurants in the us followed by grocery stores and overseas markets as production capacity rises over the coming several years impossible foods expects the price of the burger to decline as it scales up production until it is at or below the cost of commercial ground beef the companys technology can be used to produce virtually any animalbased food from steaks and chops to chicken and fish and dairy foods the burger is only the beginning brown said with its introduction at momofuku nishi we have begun the movement to build a new kind of global food system one that creates new markets for farmers supports a more resilient food supply and offers consumers new choices for the meat and dairy products they know and love – ones that are equally delicious but made from plants about impossible foods based in redwood city california impossible foods gives consumers a better choice delicious healthy affordable meat and dairy foods made directly from plants impossible foods extracts specific proteins from plants and combines them with simple natural ingredients like fats amino acids and vitamins to create raw meat from plants that delivers the
