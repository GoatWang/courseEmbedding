on dec nd  okay seriously is there a joke here and a noshave november strip on december  filed in bc bill bickel ewww comic strips comics   responses so far  responses to “gratewwwitous comic of the week” bekki dec nd  at  am  no there isn’t a joke there not that i can see anyway forget to include it bekki dec nd  at  am  at least it wasn’t there when i saw the first time please ignore me kilby dec nd  at  am  i am really surprised that mason got the word “dingleberries” past the syndicate’s censors in truth “eewwwww” ps i had never heard of “no shave november” before it is that popular james pollock dec nd  at  am  “ps i had never heard of “no shave november” before it is that popular” aka “movember” httpsenwikipediaorgwikimovember kilby dec nd  at  am  pps   just because something has a wikipedia page doesn’t mean that it is wellknown my question is whether this silly promotion is popular enough to make the comment understandable to a majority or even a sufficient minority of the syndicate’s readership ppps the “ice bucket” challenge was even sillier but more popular perhaps because it wasn’t inherently limited to  of the population james pollock dec nd  at  am  “just because something has a wikipedia page doesn’t mean that it is wellknown” um ok… but i didn’t make any such claim i know about it because the nfl supports it well at least several nfl players have… it does not have the same level of support as the breastcancer awareness gets “the “ice bucket” challenge was even sillier but more popular perhaps because it wasn’t inherently limited to  of the population” the komen foundation limits participation in the “race for the cure” events and they’re plenty popular kamino neko dec nd  at  am  movember has been going for more than a decade the ice bucket challenge lasted a couple months calling the ice bucket challenge more popular is…odd olpera dec nd  at  am   james p  no you didn’t make any such claim  and kilby didn’t impose so onto you i rather get it as he has met people like my  yo in addition to mscee  phd “grown up” son who frequently tries to enforce me likewise feuerstein dec nd  at  am  stewwwpid comic of the week kilby dec nd  at  am   kamino neko   i really have never seen or heard of this “no shaving” promotion ever before if they’ve been operating for a decade they’ve managed to keep a pretty low profile perhaps it depends on the location the ice bucket idiocy may have been shortlived but while it lasted it was a perpetual irritant in the german news media tygalilee dec nd  at  am  movember has been a thing for quite some time now so i got the noshave november reference i’m sure this disgusting “joke” was gleaned from a real life incident with the artist’s own dog back in november delayed trip to the groomer dog walks past with some dingleberries it writes itself maybe next time he should just tell the joke to his wife instead of syndicating it judge mental dec nd  at  am  i am a little surprised that some have not heard of the annual “movember” event but fwiw my exposure to it is almost strictly online while i might see a participant with a temporal mustache growth i rarely ever hear anybody talking about in “real life” on a separate point a few years ago my wife referred to me as a “dingleberry” in a joking fashion when i called her to task for calling me a piece of excrement she was bewildered in her mind the expression was roughly analogous to “goofball” when i told her the actual definition she thought i was making it up bookworm dec nd  at  am  i have heard about movember from online but i didn’t know what dingleberries were tygalilee dec nd  at  am  bookworm–you were all the better for it you’ll never have that life again you’re welcome bob dec nd  at  pm  as with many words there are several definitions for dingleberry judge mental’s wife was not incorrect according to freedictionarycom also merriam webster says the dingleberry is a shrub with edible fruit… and therefore pies of the se us dingleberry as fecal matter is also defined in several dicitonaries including the urban one but was a new definition to me morris keesan dec nd  at  pm  i’ve heard of “movember” but i’ve never heard or seen it called “no shave november” although the wikipedia “movember” page gives that term as an alternate name i’ve participated in it every year starting at least a couple of decades before the term “movember” was coined also noshave january february march april may june july august september october and december the last time i shaved my beard was in june of  and i don’t remember when before that i shaved my moustache but i think that it was probably around the early s a few years ago i got asked in october whether my beard was a red sox beard the moustache gets trimmed a few times a year when it starts getting in the way of playing woodwind instruments and the beard gets trimmed fairly short every year near the beginning of winter because when it’s long it tends to accumulate breathcondensation icicles especially while i’m skiing christine dec nd  at  pm  i think that all the people here using “movember” as “this is what “noshavevember” is shows that it’s not as well known as i thought among the people i know who show up the “rules” are fairly strict  movember is strictly about growing a mustache and only a mustache noshavebember and i’ve never seen anyone doing this who has signed up includes all facial hair kilby dec nd  at  pm     i was just about to make a derisive comment about the unreliability of online dictionaries and was going to cite the dependable definitions given by my two favorite hardbound editions alas neither american heritage nor the concise oed lists the word “dingleberry” at all oh well maybe the censors didn’t flag it because they didn’t know what it meant keera dec nd  at  pm  we do movember here in norway we did not do the ice bucket challenge we get enough rain mark m dec nd  at  pm  fwiw i have never heard of those phrases plus i don’t see a joke in the comic either i feel unfulfilled boise ed dec nd  at  pm  i have to admit that i didn’t know what a dingleberry was until i read the comments under this bc when it appeared last saturday now that i know i see no way this one’s arloness is accidental nor do i see why the “no shave november” thing was in a middecember strip btw the local tv news anchormen participated in “movember” and were looking pretty good by the end of the month then for reasons unfathomable to me they reverted to shaving james pollock dec nd  at  pm  “the local tv news anchormen participated in “movember” and were looking pretty good by the end of the month then for reasons unfathomable to me they reverted to shaving” because focusgroup testing says that cleanshaven men are more believable more authoritative or both mitch dec nd  at  pm  i generally have a mouthandchin beard not really “goatee” for warm weather then let it go fullbuttrimmed for the cold months i think i started just after thanksgiving this year so it was kinda in november but i still shave almost daily throat and upper face so it wouldn’t qualify on that count anyway and i join with those who are distinguishing movember and noshave i occasionally get celebrityresemblance remarks regarding george lucas ”has anybody ever told you you look like” but i hadn’t heard that in quite a while only to hear it two days in a row last week it must be based on my white fringe  though the clerk at cvs actually said steven spielberg but she meant george lucas mark in boston dec nd  at  pm  “dingleberries” was around as a word in the ’s it even appeared in an underground comic from that era remember underground comix i miss them meryl a dec rd  at  am  james pollock   don’t assume the no shave is limited to  of the population  but it may be “no pluck” instead never heard of this before either judge mental dec rd  at  pm  while i got what the comic was going for there was something that just now clicked for me in regards to the specific dialogue i might have been the only one but just in case the phrase “his dingleberries are never that long” is intended to be parsed as “his dingleberries are never that long as they are now” i was interpreting “never that long” to mean “never particularly long” and that “never” really meant never ie including now i would have been a little quicker on the uptake if it had said “have never been that long before” james pollock dec rd  at  pm  “don’t assume the no shave is limited to  of the population  but it may be “no pluck” instead” okay but this is another claim i never made i referred to the komen foundation’s key event which is limited to  of the population despite the fact that the cause they are fighting is not limited to  of the population the movember group’s cause is limited to  of the population comments rss leave a reply name required mail hidden required website notify me of followup comments via email
