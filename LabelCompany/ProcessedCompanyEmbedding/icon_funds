icon believes that equity markets go through themes over time simply stated stocks in industries that were market leaders at one time tend to become overpriced relative to intrinsic value and stocks

global classification in general looks at the country of incorporation and where the securities are primarily listed however in some situations additional factors may also need to be considered such

newsletter operational resource centre technology resource centre market trends news special reports directory guides events training jobs awards homenewslegal  regulationoffshore   tweet tweet the bahamas investment condominium is an icon – product targets latam market sun    tags  offshore the bahamas maturity as a wealth management centre provides it with an inherent understanding that changes to its regulatory and business environment should not be kneejerk reactions to market or political conditions but measured responses that build on the trust and confidence that the jurisdiction has earned – and values – among the broad choice of global institutions which provide asset management private banking trust and related services to owners of capital from around the world indicative of the measured and progressive approach is the bahamas’ carefully designed regulatory environment for investment funds  indeed this design has borne fruit over the last few years there has been year upon year growth largely on the back of the investment fund vehicle known as the smart fund  even with more institutionally focused templates like the smart  smart fund models sfms have been used as a costeffective investment fund vehicle for families family offices and related investors   the smart fund concept was conceived in the spirit of truly risk based regulation in recognition of the fact that depending on the structure of the investment fund the regulation could be tailored appropriately to fit the specific business case   this is justified by the cap on the number of investors that may invest in many of the templates as a result the regulation accommodates agreement by a small number of investors to waive the production of audited financials in favour of semiannual performance reports  in practice this waiver may be utilised once or not at all but the utility is there should the investment fund require it to accommodate an illiquid strategy or the consolidation of an audit in one jurisdiction  smart funds reflect market responsiveness which is the flame that ignites innovation in the bahamas its flashpoint is the level and intensity of public and private interaction that is the basis of legislation creating clientcentric products and services within a modern and robust regulatory regime   while the number of smart funds on the register grows the bahamas is not content to be viewed as simply a niche fund player it has set its sights much higher looking to expand awareness of its entire funds offering including its wellregarded professional fund which may be established for sophisticated investors satisfying certain net worth qualifying criteria     years of focused efforts have seen the bahamas gain a strong foothold in the brazilian market and while wealth management is the bedrock of the bahamas international financial services offerings it is the jurisdiction’s funds industry and its innovative product offerings that are at the leading edge of its growing business from latam brazil in particular has become an increasingly important market for the bahamas the result of a consistent and dedicated focus on assisting with satisfying the sophisticated requirements of a jurisdiction whose hedge funds number in the region of  it would not be overreaching to estimate that a large number of the existing funds licensed in the bahamas originated – especially using sfms to accommodate brazilian funds fund managers investors and strategies    under brazil’s civil code the condominium was the formalization of the concept of joint ownership and administration of property in all forms between coowners within an unincorporated entity the condominium is not a legal entity separate and apart from coowners and the administrator is empowered to act on behalf of and represent it in all matters   as a result of further amendments a condominium investment fund was created  this modified the original condominium concept providing that a condominium in the investment funds context was a ‘pooling of funds intended for investments in a diversified portfolio composed of financial assets and other instruments available on the financial market’    the bahamas investment condominium icon provides an alternative legal structure for investment funds that is inherently familiar to those in brazil and indeed those in countries which have similar civil law constructs  it was this commitment to building products that benefit from cultural and legal familiarity that saw the bahamas introduce foundations law in  the icon is an extension of this effort   the icon is defined as a contractual relationship subsisting between investors called participants under which the investors agree to pool assets for the purposes of investing those assets as a collective the structure is then licensed and fully regulated as an investment fund  as is done today using existing vehicles such as the international business company the exempted limited partnership and the unit trust   the icon is simply a new structuring vehicle that can be licensed as a smart fund professional fund or standard fund in the bahamas it is not a company not a partnership and not a trust it is a pooling mechanism and operating instrument for investment funds   so what are the advantages of an icon over a company trust or partnership aside from familiarity   centralizing “governance” and not just “administration” within a regulated entity helps to achieve international best practices of investment fund governance and operation  the governing administrator and general administrator of an icon are regulated whether in the bahamas or an equivalent jurisdiction the icon can be simply established in a much more streamlined way than a corporate vehicle there is flexibility  it’s possible to set up an icon where investors are called on to contribute in the case of negative net equity before the fund can be deemed insolvent  it’s also possible to establish an icon where the liability of the investors is limited    the icon shares many features with the brazilian condominium the icon possesses no distinct legal personality save that for the purposes of the legislation it is able to own assets in its name enter into agreements in its name and sue and be sued in its name  the lack of legal personality is addressed by the appointment of an administrator that is empowered to transact in its name and represent and bind the icon   the icon is established by the initial participants signing “governing regulations” which is the governing document of the icon the initial participants engage the icon’s administrator which must be an institution that is regulated by the securities commission of the bahamas as an investment fund administrator under the investment funds act  the administrator will then prepare a certificate evidencing that the icon has been established and which contains the information specified in the schedule attached to the legislation which brought icon into existence  this certificate subsequently is signed by the administrator and submitted along with a prescribed fee to the registrar general for stamping    as foreshadowed above the administrator can be a single institution or separate institutions performing two distinct roles – that of “governance” and that of “general administration”  the role of the governing administrator is similar to that of a director trustee or general partner  the governing administrator bears a fiduciary responsibility to participants in the icon  the general administrator performs such roles as maintaining the register of participation interests issuing subscription confirmations etc   a unique icon feature is the provision for other types of entities  eg companies unit trusts and exempted limited partnerships  to convert to an icon by following a defined procedure  icon legislation is clear as to the effect of conversion and it is important to note that conversion does not relieve a converted entity from liabilities or obligations incurred preceding the conversion to an icon   while designed to be reflective of brazilian requirements and thus intended to target fundfamiliar investors looking to diversify away from their domestic market  icon is not solely focussed on brazil the bahamas is also seeing considerable interest in the fund from other latin american countries because the structure enables the governance operation and asset optimization in a manner that other structures simply cannot  sophisticated investors are able to access and establish offshore funds in a format to which they are already very well accustomed where the fund administrator assumes a relatively enhanced role encompassing the traditional functions of accounting and investor relations in addition to fund governance thus a familiar legal structure can be matched up with the regulatory overlay of the bahamian funds regime which also has much in common with the brazilian fund regulatory environment considering that both countries are members a signatories of the international organization of securities commissions iosco   it’s important to note that the icon is simply the structure that underpins the licensing category  it is possible to license an icon as a standard fund professional fund or a smart fund  a good example of how this works well for brazil is the combination of the icon with the smart fund model  license the “icon” the beauty of the icon is the flexibility to customize the fund’s operating structure in a way that efficiently provides for reduced legal and cost concerns customization of a fund for asset management requires the consideration of a number of factors including its proposed strategy investment policy investment restrictions counterparties liquidity provisions and total expense ratio moreover the most important factor from the investor’s perspective is often found to be its tax implications and how to structure the fund so that it is taxneutral and therefore more cost efficient   on this basis the sfm  provides for a regulatory framework that is comparable to the onshore brazilian multimarket superqualified fund which is established as a condominium and may invest up to  of its assets outside of brazil unlike other types of brazilian funds currently the minimum initial investment per investor is  million brazilian reais which is roughly equivalent to the minimum investment requirement for the sfm  ie  million us dollars   in the current climate success for an ifc depends on a host of factors but certainly one of them is the ability to develop marketresponsive compliant and innovative products  the icon follows in the traditions of the bahamas foundation and the bahamas executive entity in being the first of their  kind in the common law world…and that’s quite iconic indeed   like this article  get the free daily newsletter print

  sign in to favorite this discuss comment blog about share this email facebook twitter by neil hartnell tribune business editor nhartnelltribunemedianet while bahamian fund administrators will be “much more on the hook” than with similar structures a senior industry executive says the “rewards” from an iconic launch will be worth the risk aliya allen the bahamas financial services board’s bfsb chief executive told tribune business that this nation had found “the perfect product” with which to penetrate the investment funddriven brazilian and latin american markets speaking in a recent interview and ahead of the investment condominium icon structure’s august unveiling in brazil ms allen said there had already been “a great deal of interest” shown by brazilian clients intermediaries and funds professionals she added that the icon’s creation provided further proof of the bahamas’s ability to innovate and develop unique products without compromising this nation’s regulatory reputation and strength the icon is now in the final industry consultation stages before being presented to cabinet and ms allen said it provided an ideal vehicle to penetrate brazil the bahamian financial services industry’s prime target in recent years “i think the challenge is to create a fund for an environment that is very funds driven that is very familiar to brazilian investors and managers and which accommodates their needs for portfolio diversification” ms allen told tribune business “we think that we’ve found the perfect product to do so for marketing purposes we’re calling it the icon without selling it too high it refers to innovation and what we think is the potential for growth in the funds industry as a result” the icon is designed to be fully compliant with brazilian laws and operate like one of that nation’s products so is thus intended to target fundfamiliar investors looking to diversify away from their domestic market “we know we have brazilians interested in the product already who are looking to set up funds” ms allen added “and some are saying they are just waiting for us to launch “there is a great deal of interest in the fund i think we’re one of the only jurisdictions that develop this type of product and we think that even though we designed the icon with brazil in mind there’s also a lot of interest in the fund from latin american countries ms allen said the icon would be regulated by the securities commission like any other bahamasdomiciled investment fund structure  a further attraction for investors she added that the new fund could be incorporated as either a standard fund or professional fund or under any of the existing smart fund templates outlining its main features ms allen said that while the icon was “not a legal person separate from the investors” it still retained the features of a ‘corporate personality’ such as the ability to be bound by contracts the icon’s bahamasbased administrator will act in its name or on its behalf placing much more of the complianceregulatory burden on their shoulders compared to other investment fund structures “because the administrator in the investment condominium is given much more responsibility we do have administrators much more on the hook than perhaps the other structures” ms allen told tribune business “that’s largely because we don’t have a board of directors for the fund per se but we think the rewards will be worth it in terms of increased business” the bfsb chief executive added that unlike the bahamas’ traditional wealth management and asset protection products the icon was designed for collective investment and to generate positive returns and its launch targeted for the bfsb’s next promotional trip to brazil on august  will also boost this nation’s reputation as an innovator “i think it demonstrates that the bahamas is adaptive that it is flexible that it is looking to innovate while not sacrificing the regulatory strength and standing of this jurisdiction” ms allen told tribune business she added that it also answered the call made by sean mcweeney qc graham thompson  co partner and prime minister perry christie’s key adviser for more innovation by the bahamas in financial services industry describing his call at the recent society of trust and estate practitioners step caribbean conference as “a timely message” ms allen added “it’s very tempting in challenging times to sort of draw down or draw back on marketing and promotional efforts and investments you make into new products as you tend to think you need to retrench” yet the bahamas had set this “conventional wisdom” aside to focus on developing new products services and policies to spurt growth in its financial services industry more

icon fact sheet fact sheet  english fact sheet  portuguese fact sheet  spanish the icon is the legal structure underpinning the investment fund in the same way as investment funds are legally organized as companies exempted limited partnerships and unit trusts the icon’s purpose is tied to its operation as an investment fund and is defined as the contractual relationship subsisting between participants agreeing to the pooling of assets for the purpose of investing those assets collectively it possesses no distinct legal personality save that for the purposes of the legislation it is able to hold assets in its name enter into agreements in its name and sue and be sued in its name the lack of legal personality is addressed by the appointment of an administrator that is empowered to transact in its name and represent and bind the icon a unique feature of the investment condominium act is the provision for other types of entities  eg companies unit trusts and exempted limited partnerships  to convert to an icon by following a defined procedure the icon demonstrates the bahamas’ keen understanding of the regulatory environment and the needs of the clients we service read

consumer defensive category are also known as consumer staples companies and they include securities of businesses that provide consumers with products and services that are not affected by seasonal or cyclical shifts in the overall market consumer staples include products that meet everyday needs such as utilities food and beverages health care and other nondurable goods such as personal hygiene products investing in defensive stocks provides investors an opportunity to participate in a specific equity market that has a longstanding history of financial stability due to constant consumer demand regardless of market movement or downturns in other equity sectors additionally consumer staples companies are often large in terms of market capitalization and are able to provide investors with consistent dividend payouts while the consumer defensive sector helps in creating a fairly conservative portfolio that is able to withstand recessionary periods within the broader equity market investors should keep in mind that there is still risk involved companies that provide consumer staples often lag in performance when the market is doing well resulting in lower returns than other equity positions investors seeking exponential growth within a portfolio do not turn to consumer staples to achieve that end but rather they utilize these stocks to stabilize an asset allocation
