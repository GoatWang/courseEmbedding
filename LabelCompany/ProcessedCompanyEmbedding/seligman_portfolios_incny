rates on their foreign portfolio holdings or other amounts receivable or payable in foreign currency a forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a

portfolio are allocated among them g the treatment for financial statement purposes of distributions made during the year from net investment income or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate treatment for federal income tax purposes these differences primarily are caused by differences in the timing of the recognition of certain components of income expense or capital gain and the recharacterization of foreign exchange gains or losses to either ordinary income or realized capital gain for federal income tax purposes where such differences are permanent in nature they are reclassified in the components of net assets based on their ultimate characterization for federal income tax purposes any such reclassification will have no effect on net assets results of operations
