ceo portfolio click here  v gordon clemons jr isnt a typical corporate bigwig a selfdescribed radical rightwinger from idaho he runs a small littleknown company that only one analyst bothers to cover yet he may be one of the countrys savviest chief executives his company corvel  crvl a provider of medical costcontainment services has seen its shares soar more than  since it went public in  it has posted consistent annual earnings growth of  or higher and a  return on equity now the company is making a major push onto the internet how has clemons made a go of it there are four key ways by keeping a clean balance sheet by setting up a decentralized workforce only  of his  employees work at the companys headquarters by investing in technology to address a changing landscape and perhaps most important by exploiting a growing niche theres no substitute for being in the right business he says the company faces competition from cignas  cig intracorp first health  fhcc and closely held concentra but rising health care costs have sent companies scrambling for ways to keep expenses in line so theres room for growth in the industry the healthbenefits sector is a nice growth area says marc postiglione the bear stearns analyst who covers corvels stock postiglione rates corvel at  a share a hold on concerns that the stock is too highly valued but clemons who notes that the company is buying back stock begs to differ i dont think paying a pricetoearnings multiple of  or so is overpaying but we dont try to sell people on that point born to lead clemons attributes his success with corvel in part to the lessons he learned growing up in idaho his father was a hardworking farmer as well as a bit of a madman inventor he says while his mother was a family friend of the albertsons who built the supermarket business in boise the good ceo portfolio corvels v gordon clemons jrage tenure founded the company in  took it public in  after getting an mba from the university of oregon clemons worked for ford and then for fmc however they eventually fired me for being such a jerk clemons says he didnt want to raise prices at the chemical division he was running and so he got ousted he says ive always been stubborn about not compromising what you believe in and thats why im running my own company he adds clemons also worked at cignas intracorp and was president of caremark when baxter international acquired the company in  i was the only guy who voted against the deal when baxter brought me in they showed me a management chart and i wasnt on it i figured it was time to move on he says clemons founded fortis in  with funding from holding company north star universal fortis went public in  changing its name to corvel in  the company initially targeted workers compensation case management but expanded into other areas corvel headquartered in irvine calif now offers more than  customers a range of services from vocational rehabilitation and medicalbilling reviews to insurance in its fiscal year ended march  corvel posted revenue of  million and net income of  a share  up  and  respectively for the first half of this fiscal year earnings rose  to  cents a share and revenue climbed  to  million clemons doesnt offer earnings forecasts but analyst postiglione sees pershare earnings of  in  and  in  corvels books are debtfree in part because it hasnt had to buy its growth through acquisitions the company also generates lots of cash  which represents  of its assets  to fund its operations and organic growth initiatives this is a company that has done a lot of little things right and one of the biggest is consistently investing in new technologies and looking for ways to build out services postiglione says the next step onefourth of all health care costs go to administration and that has been a boon for corvel but clemons says administrative costs will continue to drop as technology and automated services improve our prices have been under pressure for the past  years he said so the ceo has positioned corvel to benefit from a surge in transactions to offset a drop in margins a linchpin of that strategy  and a big component of the companys technology spending  has been the internet the centerpiece of the companys internet strategy is caremccom its threeyearold claimsmanagement web site caremc has been a big success helping to drive revenue to other areas of corvel postiglione says corvel sees the site becoming a portal for health care management services  offering the services of corvel as well as its competitors the nice thing about the internet strategy is it takes what we already do to the next level  giving the adjuster the ability to approve bills bills getting paid online clemons says clemons envisions some bumps in the next few years in making his web dreams into reality but he says the company has the infrastructure to make it work we try not to hype that and keep it out of the stock but behind closed doors were very excited about it he says these may sound like pieinthesky web plans but analyst postiglione who concedes that corvel has proved him wrong time and again in its ability to post sharp growth said gordon
