do we mean by reinvestmentoctober   by tom saberhagenbottleneck businessesapril   by john neff the power of compounding  akre capital management the power of compounding by tom saberhagen what is compounding a lot has been written about the power of compounding we’ve all heard illustrations of the extraordinary results that may be accomplished if compounding is allowed to do its work over long periods of time but what is compounding how does it work there’s an extreme example the story of native americans selling the island of manhattan as the story goes the selling party in the deal collected an estimated  worth of beads and trinkets from the transaction which took place in the year  so how does compounding play into this let’s say the sellers invested their initial  at a rate of  per annum and then stuck with this investment program for the following  years today their initial  would be worth more than  i like this example of compounding because it illustrates that the rate of return on an investment doesn’t need to be extraordinary for extraordinary results to occur what is crucial is having the ability to sustain an investment program uninterrupted over a very long period of time in the real world of investing “life gets in the way” it’s rare for an investor to enjoy a streak of decades of compounding in any investment without the interruptions of distributions and taxes this story simply reminds us that striving for sustained uninterrupted compounding over long periods of time is smart investing and that’s precisely our goal many people think of us as a “value investor” and others ask whether we are a value or a growth investor we’ve started to say we’re neither we are a compounding investor what does it mean to be a compounding investor it means we try to invest in businesses that have the ability to compound internally over the course of many years to think like a compounding investor is very natural for people who buy small or private businesses the private investor wants to concentrate carefully on a few business investments and hopes the accountants will report back consistently at the end of each year that equity per share has grown private investors don’t think about trying to dart in and out of investments on a daily or monthly basis this approach is so basic it’s often forgotten in the public equity markets in public markets it’s become too easy to get distracted by hourtohour market gyrations and all the breathless excitement brokers and the media put on shortterm news to be a compounding investor you need to tune out the shortterm noise we think hard about the ingredients required for a business to compound in value over the course of many years we believe these include  an ability to generate above average returns on shareholders’ capital  opportunities to deploy additional capital at above average returns and  a management team with the skill and judgment to sustain the process of compounding over a long period of time in the face of competition you’ll recognize this is just another way of describing our “threelegged stool” approach business management reinvestment how does akre’s investment philosophy demonstrate the power of compounding we strive to invest in businesses with these three ingredients of compounding and to buy them at reasonable prices if we do this there is no reason or need to trade in and out of these businesses to achieve above average returns we don’t want to rely primarily on our contrarian instincts or our ability to play market volatility in order to generate returns like the private investor we want the businesses we buy to be growing in real economic value each day we like to hold investments for many years to allow their internal compounding to do its work it’s a wonderful thing not to have to realize a taxable gain the tax deferral available by investing in businesses that compound internally is an enormous and often underappreciated advantage yet in the real world businesses do change we need to be constantly vigilant about these changes some businesses are getting worse as years pass while others are getting better and so our investment portfolio gradually evolves about the author tom saberhagen is a partner at akre capital management view full bio recent posts exceptional peoplefebruary  the bottom line of all investing is rate of returnmarch  what do we mean by reinvestmentoctober   our investment philosophy  akre capital management our investment philosophy by chuck akre what is so important about the threelegged stool we speak a lot about “essences” and the essence of our investment approach is perfectly captured by the visual of a “threelegged stool” this metaphoric three legged stool describes what we look for in an investment  extraordinary business  talented management and  great reinvestment opportunities and histories i have an old threelegged milking stool in our conference room and it is clear by looking at it that it is sturdy and durable  we believe our stool is just as sturdy and durable based on our many years of experience what was the inspiration for your investment philosophy it is common knowledge that the average return in the us equity asset category over the last century has been in the neighborhood of  or  it just so happens that this figure correlates with the rate of return on the owner’s capital and frequently with the growth in the book value per share of the typical us company we posited from this observation that our return on an asset would therefore approximate the return on the owner’s capital absent any distributions and assuming a constant valuation and since our stated goal is to compound our clients’ partners’ and shareholders’ capital at an above average rate while incurring a below average level of risk we needed to identify this group of superior businesses which earn above average rates of return on their owner’s capital how does your investment philosophy differ from other asset managers there was a time when i used to answer that question by saying “i don’t know you tell me” now however i believe that we are very different in at least two important ways first our decision to buy or sell shares in a business is based on the same fundamental criteria we do not set sell price targets when we buy a security – we often say we are not looking for the exit on the way in – because we are not looking to simply trade securities based on their price movement rather we are looking to compound the capital we manage and have identified that investing in these “extraordinary” businesses as we define them is the best way to achieve our goal we begin sell discussions when one or more of the legs of our stool is “broken or injured” the outcomes over our years of experience clearly reinforce this notion second wall street’s obsession with what we describe as the “beat by a penny miss by a penny” syndrome frequently gives us opportunities to make investments at attractive valuations we keep our focus squarely on growth in the underlying economic value per share – often defined as book value per share – over the course of time our timetable is five and ten years ahead and quarterly “misses” often create opportunities for the capital we manage about the author chuck akre is managing member chief executive officer and
