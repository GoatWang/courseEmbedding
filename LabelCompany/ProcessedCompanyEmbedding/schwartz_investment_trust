performance of different segments of the market varied greatly last year largecapitalization stocks and growth stocks in particular did poorly smallcap and midcap value stocks which we emphasize did especially well this is not surprising since our stocks lagged when euphoria reigned in the major market averages in the late s the schwartz value fund was not managed any differently in  than in any of the previous  years it just happened that a lot of the seeds planted years ago bore fruit in  we plant seeds almost every day and never know when the harvest will come in thats the nature of value investing year in and year out the unglamorous stock selection process doesnt change much we look for growing companies that are financially powerful have proprietary products and capable managements and importantly we buy only when the share prices are low in relation to earnings that keeps the risk low  will likely see the start of an economic recovery the federal reserves concerted effort to drive interest rates lower over the past fourteen months provides reason to be optimistic corporations and consumers are deleveraging corporate debt refinancing will reduce corporate interest expense by  billion in  at the same time residential mortgage refinancing will increase consumer buying power by an additional  billion this year recently enacted tax cuts and increased government spending will also help raise consumer confidence the big boost to economic activity wont come however until capital spending resumes particularly tech spending which may be a while since excess capacity is so widespread in that area even so the combination of the feds monetary stimulation and congress fiscal stimulus should result in expanding corporate profits at a  plus annual rate by the fourth quarter of this year with inventories getting lean and productivity strong even minor increments in sales volume should result in a significantly better bottom line for much of corporate america in managing the schwartz value fund portfolio we strive to be contrarian investors because one cant buy stocks at bargain prices when theyre popular consequently were always looking for companies where the consensus outlook is temporarily clouded making the stock prices unduly depressed an industry meeting these standards today is specialty retailers even pndnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd though some consumers are overextended the macro condition for retailers is really quite good inflation is moderate interest rates are low and tax rates are coming down in addition aging baby boomers are hitting their peak earnings years and inheriting unprecedented wealth so the current problems of excess consumer debt are probably overblown also the rapid attrition which is taking place within the retail industry is a plus for the survivors consequently selected specialty retailers are well positioned since the best time to accumulate stocks is when theyre unloved and underowned schwartz

interest is at least equal to the amount to be repaid to the fund under the agreement f estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates

svf seeks longterm capital appreciation through value investing  purchasing shares of strong growing companies at reasonable prices because small and medium size companies offer vast reward opportunities fundamental analysis is used to identify emerging companies with outstanding business characteristics sometimes the best values are issues not followed by wall street analysts most value investors buy fair companies at an excellent price svf attempts to buy excellent companies at a fair price the essence of value investing is finding companies with great business characteristics which by their nature offer a margin of safety a truly fine business requires few assets to provide a consistently expanding stream of income svf also purchases shares which are temporarily outoffavor and selling below intrinsic value a common thread in svf investments is that the market price is below what a corporate or entrepreneurial buyer might be willing to pay for the entire business the auction nature and the inefficiencies of the stock market are such that svf can often buy a minority interest in a fine company at a small fraction of the price per share necessary to acquire the entire

after all the year brought an economic recession an unprecedented terrorist assault on the us homeland and the greatest drop in corporate profits since the great depression in fact given all those impediments it is somewhat surprising the stock market showed only an  decline for the year as measured by the sp  stock index as always however adversity creates opportunity and the ave maria

spread between the funds return and the markets at yearend  basis points or  was the widest since the funds inception such strong relative returns especially over short time periods do not come without a little luck which of course we always welcome but luck alone is never enough the market is not a roulette wheel there are rules prudent investors need to adhere to if they want to maximize

which the market will value the shares three years hence because our firm is small we are not limited to investing in large capitalization companies we have deployed substantial experience in evaluating small and midcap stocks with the value approach we buy shares of financially powerful companies when they are outoffavor and attractively priced and sell them when they no longer meet our standards this contrarian discipline reduces the risk of loss while enhancing returns this approach to value investing has produced very good riskadjusted returns for clients we do not worship at the altar of relative performance but instead strive for attractive absolute returns with low risk modest risk incurred is a very important ingredient in the formula some managers achieve higher returns but subject their clients’ assets to significantly greater risks fixedincome securities are often utilized for their defensive characteristics which include predictable income flow and relative principal stability based on low historical correlations fixed income securities may provide a hedge in periods when the stock market performs poorly  the firm actively manages highgrade fixedincome portfolios with an emphasis on intermediate and shorter durations  we also employ sector credit and yield curve analysis designed to benefit portfolios from rate shifts and spread changes without resorting to excessive swapping to capture tiny price fluctuations  quality is paramount in our selection process and we avoid junk bonds mortgages and derivatives           we offer a diverse menu of investment options including domestic and international equities as well as fixed income securities demonstrated investment management expertise across market capitalizations “you only have to know

schwartz value focused fund rcmfx ave maria mutual funds ave maria separately managed accounts contact schwartz value focused fund schwartz value focused fund “svf” is a mutual fund which seeks longterm capital appreciation through value investing – purchasing shares of strong growing companies at reasonable prices because small and medium size companies offer vast reward opportunities fundamental analysis is used to identify emerging companies with outstanding business characteristics sometimes the best values are issues not followed by wall street analysts most value investors attempt to buy fair companies at an excellent price svf attempts to buy excellent companies at a fair price the essence of value investing is finding companies with great business characteristics which by their nature offer a margin of safety a truly fine business requires few assets to produce a consistently expanding stream of income svf also purchases shares which are temporarily outoffavor and selling below intrinsic value a common thread in svf investments is that the market price is below what a corporate or entrepreneurial buyer might be willing to pay for the entire business the auction nature and the inefficiencies of the stock market are such that svf can often buy a minority interest in a fine company at a small fraction of the price per share necessary to acquire the entire company   past performance does not guarantee future results mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible the fund’s investments in small and mid capitalization companies could experience greater volatility than investments in largecapitalization companies prospective investors should read the prospectus carefully and consider the fund’s investment objectives risks
