three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents   c stockbased compensation   the company follows asc  stock compensation which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions asc  requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized the company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options     f   table of contents   d use of estimates and assumptions   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates   e earnings loss per share   the basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period the diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity diluted earnings loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the company   f income taxes   income taxes are provided in accordance with asc  income taxes a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities   deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   no provision was made for federal income tax   g revenue recognition   we will recognize revenues in accordance with asc  revenue recognition which provides guidance on the recognition presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec asc  outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies we will recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured our shipment terms will generally be fob shipping point as outlined in our invoices or sales order   h advertising   advertising is expensed in the period in which it is incurred there has been no advertising expense in the reporting periods presented   i intangible assets   intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life the company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period the company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the original estimate of an assets useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an assets useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment for the period november   inception through november   we recognized  in amortization expense     f   table of contents   j fair value of financial instruments   asc  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value     · level  – valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities       · level  – valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets       · level  – valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity therefore requiring management’s best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value   in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability   fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates these financial instruments include cash and accounts payable the company’s bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit therefore bear minimal credit risk and are carried at amortized costs which approximates the fair value   k recently issued accounting pronouncements   in march  the fasb issued

reported within the time communicated to the companys management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required

management believes that a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met and no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitation in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuers and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected   changes in internal controls   there were no changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended november   that have materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   internal control systems no matter how well designed and operated have inherent limitations therefore even a
