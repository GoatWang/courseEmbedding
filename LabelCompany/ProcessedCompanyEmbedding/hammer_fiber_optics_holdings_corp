in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forwardlooking statements item  business our corporate history and background the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on september   under the name recursos montana sa the companys principal activity was as a preexploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the company during this time the company was deemed a shell company in the preexploration stage of our business and was ultimately unable to commence exploration activities on february   the company entered into a share exchange agreement with tanaris power holdings inc whereby the company acquired  of tanaris power holdings inc issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the companys common stock equal  of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company at the closing and cash consideration to tanaris in the aggregate amount of  tanaris power holdings inc was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithiumion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications on march   the company amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to tanaris power holdings inc on april   tanaris power holdings inc a nevada corporation entered into a share exchange agreement the share exchange agreement with hammer fiber optics investments ltd a delaware corporation hfoi and the controlling stockholders of hfoi the hfoi shareholders pursuant to the share exchange agreement the company acquired  shares of common stock of hfoi from the hfoi shareholders the hfoi shares and in exchange the company issued to the hfoi shareholders  postmerger restricted shares of its common stock the hmmr shares as a result of the share exchange agreement hfoi shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company hammer fiber optics investments ltd was formed in the state of delaware on june    on april   our board of directors approved a plan of merger the plan of merger under nevada revised statutes nrs section a to merge the merger with our whollyowned subsidiary hammer fiber optics holdings corp a nevada corporation to effect a name change from tanaris power holdings inc to hammer fiber optics holdings corp the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger the plan of merger also provides for a  for  exchange ratio for shareholders of both the company and hammer fiber optics holdings corp which had the effect of a  for  reverse split of our common stock articles of merger were filed with the secretary of state of nevada on april   and on april   this corporate action was submitted to finra for its review and approval on may   the financial industry regulatory authority finra approved our merger with our whollyowned subsidiary hammer fiber optics holdings corp accordingly thereafter the companys name was changed and our shares of common stock began trading on the over the counter bulletin board otcbb under our new ticker symbol hmmr as of may   current operations hammer fiber optics holdings corp is an alternative telecommunications carrier that is poised to position itself as the premier provider of diversified dark fiber networking solutions as well as high capacity broadband wireless access networks in the new jersey southern and central region and the metro philadelphia area our goal is to provide network access to underserved markets along the transatlantic landing corridors that contains the flexibility to deliver cutting edge solutions to data centers carriers and other various communication providers aggregators enterprise and poorly served residential broadband customers despite the fact that the usa has literally millions of miles of fiber optic in the ground across this vast country very little of the country actually enjoys the significant speeds that this technology has promised for decades now this is due to the fact that delivering services to residences and small business enterprises in urban and semiurban areas have proven over the years to be severely cost prohibitive for all the major service providers across the usa several companies selling services in the fiber optic industry will promise consumers that they can deliver fiber to them shortly and cost effectively but in effect this has barely happened and it is becoming more evident that such a scenario is bound to never happen the one thing about this industry that is factual is that fiber and wireless technologies are on track to coexist in the deployment of broadband services to the masses the exponential growth of streaming media has driven massive demand by consumers but the unsolved last mile connectivity will slow this demand down to a snail pace and most consumers will simply only hear about how wonderful it is to enjoy true broadband capacity from the few that actually have been privileged to receive it it is for this reason that that the company was formed what is dark fiber dark fiber is optical fiber cable which has been set in place for anticipated future use in carrying network signals in the form of light but is not yet lit by laser equipment intended to be placed on both ends for the purposes of creating data connectivity between points the dark strands can be leased to customers who want to establish optical connections between their own locations or colocation facilities utilizing their own network equipment and security protocols the cablelaying industry is seeing accelerated growth once again in a widely quoted statistic the cru group research firm estimated  million miles of optical fiber were installed in the usa in  the most since  even in the areas that were connected during the initial boom there are new structures to be served and more are built every year at the present time fiber still only reaches a relatively small percentage of all the buildings in the country with this buildout process ongoing more customers than at any other point in history are looking for fiber solutions to connect their junction points into existing data transport substructures why use dark fiber purchasing lit fiber services requires service providers to pay significantly higher prices and incremental costs for provisioned bandwidth as demand increases which proportionally increases cost to the end consumer dark fiber solutions provide hmmr with the ability to upgrade from  gbps to  gbps to  gbps as technology evolves by simply installing the latest in wavelengthdivision multiplexing wdm on a single dark fiber pair this ensures that our products always have sufficient bandwidth planned to cater for the everexpanding consumer demand for high capacity broadband services without the need to continually increase cost to consumers as bandwidth demand increases  latency latency is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another in a network and is commonly expressed in terms of milliseconds ms latency can be a major factor in overall performance of broadband services and it is important that we have full control of its network endtoend by provisioning dark fiber we have the ability to manage the amount of routers and switching services installed on its fiber backbone network which greatly reduces the potential of latency and improves the overall customer experience the industry today fiber penetration in the local access network is still very limited even in the developed parts of the usa and this is mainly due to the high cost of installation and maintenance of a fiber access network cable technology has evolved with everincreasing data rates and remains the most popular wire line broadband technology in terms of subscriptions close to fourfifths of the united states is now connected in some form to the broadband internet universe with cable remaining the dominant mode of access across the continentwide landmass despite this a large component of this connectivity fails to deliver sufficient capacity to satisfy the high demand for bandwidthintensive modern consumer applications the companys competitive solution the company has taken advantage of deploying its last mile wireless technology over the latest docsis  standard which is fundamentally what cable technology is based on this strategy allows for the use of tried and tested methodology utilizing cable modems that are produced in bulk and are inexpensive off theshelf items in all cases of its current deployment consumers are enjoying the power that fiber optic services promised however the usa has been notoriously slow to recognize and accept that this is the solution to solve inadequate last mile access we have therefore decided to enter this market without the involvement andor validation of the incumbent operators who in our opinion are all actively engaged in depreciating their existing massive legacy technology capex commitments we will operate our wireless broadcast solution in the  and ghz frequencies providing as much as  gbps of capacity per sector in the cell range up to gbps per tower licensing for frequencies in these bands has been facilitated by straightpath communications nyse mkt symbol strp who owns a large section of the ghz and  ghz local multipoint distribution service lmds spectrum across the usa diagram  describes the architecture of the ghz and ghz access deployment as planned we will purchase dark fiber wherever possible on the terrestrial fiber backhaul networks as well as in the metro fiber rings fiber spurs will then be deployed from fiber breakout splitters to leased towers where the wireless broadband transmitters are located as indicated in the following diagram click to enlarge diagram  the companys endtoend network architecture last mile access solution  the access network portion of the architecture described in diagram  is the ultimate in the value proposition provided by the company throughout the ecosystem the components forming an integral part of this first to market and unique technology is more fully diagrammatically described in diagram  the hammer wireless technology is licensed exclusively to the company in the state of new jersey click to enlarge diagram  hammer wireless access architecture  a simple and practical concept the concept is very easy to understand a single tower is erected to serve an area of up to km in circumference and every roof top that is in range of and can be seen from the tower or high site where the wireless technology is erected can be served within less than two hours of an order being received and executed by us this means no digging up of roads pavements or lawns to reach a subscriber premises rendering time to market substantially reduced over competing technologies the system utilizes a combination of a tried and proven set of applications such as fiber optic backhaul and docsys  technologies deployed in an innovative manner the last mile connectivity is between a microwave receiver mounted at the customer premises and a microwave transmitter mounted on a tower or high site the main advantage of a modern microwave system is its high immunity to interference easy reconfiguration and quick time deployment to market thus it can be a practical alternative compared to the high cost and complicated logistics of deploying last mile fiber cable the main drawback is that it requires lineofsight just like a satellite network the benefits of wireless microwave as a preferred last mile access solution has however fueled technological innovation in microwave research and the development of an advanced pointtomultipoint solution known as hammer wireless air has emerged this groundbreaking innovation in microwave technology is now capable of delivering upwards of a mbps of dedicated bandwidth to an enduser in a fast and easy deployment unlocking a whole new array of revenue streams and consumer options for network operators such as hammer we manage our own isp and content delivery node cdn equipment from several data centers situated along the metro fiber rings traversing city and suburban centers this network topology will always be managed by us across the entire ecosystem to ensure that costs are managed and curbed and that quality is guaranteed throughout the entire distribution chain see diagram  click to enlarge diagram  network responsibility matrix  multi dwelling units mdu installation in cases where mdus are selected diagram  displays a typical shared model where one hammer wireless air metro transceiver is utilized to provide the building with a high capacity broadband connection and the rest of the tenants are connected to this single connection by way of dedicated standard off the shelf cable modems this is very typical of a cable plant where one feeder cable enters the building and is distributed to each apartment by way of cable splitters the hammer wireless transceiver will then provide a coax cable run or will utilize existing coax cable runs to each tenants apartment or office which represents a significantly optimized mdu model click to enlarge diagram  typical mdu installation served by single wireless connection quality of service assurance a single ghz transceiver to the mdu provides all the bandwidth needed to deliver hdtv in both broadcast and videoondemand mode ultra high speed internet service as well as fixed voice services to each residential dwelling or corporate office suite due to the fact that the cable modems share in the pool of bandwidth per sector on each tower the constant available bandwidth ensures that the subscriber enjoys the most enjoyable broadband and tv experience possible when the network is at peak capacity which normally occurs around pm to pm at night the system will automatically pull more capacity off the fiber backbone to ensure that a good customer experience is maintained at all times  single dwelling units sdu installation the company expects to connect many singlefamily homes to the highspeed broadband access network during the rollout of the hammer wireless network especially those rebuilt following the devastation by the sandy super storm during  where many homes were left unserved a single standard satellite dish with the hammer wireless technology transceiver connected to standard offthe shelf modems and set top boxes is deployed for each household to

is able to provide access to a significant amount of tv video content via its relationship with select vendors and is therefore able to deliver content for a variety of languages and cultures alike it is envisaged that the company will provide a choice of  plus quality tv channels based on content from all over the globe video on demand will be delivered utilizing the latest over thetop ott technologies and literally thousands of movie titles will be stored in the video storage area network at the main company network operations center in new jersey this content is capable of being delivered to customers at the highest quality hd format due to the very high capacity bandwidth delivery mechanism of our fiber optic backbone and the hammer wireless access network as per capita incomes start improving as a result of a better economic outlook more people will be able to afford access to hammer services in the region and it is as or more affordable than competitive offerings for similar speeds its large bandwidth capabilities with internet and data access speeds are capable of being delivered up to mbps and more to the consumer diagram  indicates all the multimedia

concept of delivering multimedia services such as television interactive tv video on demand internet and voice services is by no means unique to our solution and is a tried and tested methodology evident in hundreds of developed markets worldwide what is abundantly unique is the way in which we deliver this multimedia content in these developed markets that are particularly poorly served and critically lacking in reliable costeffective broadband service the hammer wireless access technology has been awarded to hammer on an exclusive basis across the entire state of new jersey usa additional territories will be added to hammers exclusivity on a casebycase basis following successful deployment of new jersey initial deployment in the ghz spectrum in new jersey according to the  american community survey new jersey is the fourthsmallest state but the most densely populated of the  united states new jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of new york city and philadelphia and is also the secondwealthiest us state by median household income we have elected to initially roll out the hammer wireless access network along the new jersey shore area which is indicated by way of the orange circles these circles represent the household and businesses in service range of the hammer wireless transmitters these areas have been carefully studied and scoped out as the first market that we will serve due to its perfect lineofsight los characteristics and poorly served broadband coverage by incumbent operators the coverage area falls within the licensed ghz lmds spectrum of straight path communications issued by the fcc which is sub licensed to the company for deployment of the planned broadband wireless network  typical tower site layout towers similar to those of cellular communications are planned for deployment in many poorly served areas across new jersey shore line typical coverage of a tower in indicated in diagram  approximately  towers are

item a risk factors you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the sec we believe these risks and uncertainties individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity further additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our results and business operations risks associated with our business our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products and services or upgrades of current products and services and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products services and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations · our ability to introduce leading products such optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment at competitive prices · our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws  we rely on contract manufacturing of our products our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality cost working conditions and other requirements or failures by our contractors to perform could harm our sales and reputation we source our products from international manufacturers as a result we must locate and secure production that meets our demands we depend on our manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity we do not have material longterm contracts with any of our manufacturers and these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time our dependence on contract manufacturers could subject us to a number of risks if these manufacturers do not meet our quality cost working conditions and other requirements or if they fail to materially perform any of which could seriously harm our sales and reputation further if we need to place greater demands on our current manufacturers due to increased customer demands or seek additional or replacement manufacturers we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us if at all violation of labor laws and practices by our manufacturers and suppliers could harm our business we require our manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations while the company promotes ethical business practices we do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their labor practices the violation of labor or other laws by any of our manufacturers or suppliers or divergence of their labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the local markets could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm the value of our trademarks damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings a privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationship with our customers expose the company to litigation risk and adversely affect our business as part of our normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information despite security measures we have in place our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers expose the company to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business our articles of incorporation exculpates our officers and directors from certain liability to our company or our stockholders our articles of incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of our officers and directors for their acts or failures to act except for acts involving intentional misconduct fraud or a knowing violation of law this limitation on liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders from suing our officers and directors based upon breaches of their duties to our company our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders as such they will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the board of directors possibly conflicting with the interests of other stockholders our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders as such they exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control of our business this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or entrenching management or the board of directors which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and consequently could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the companys independent auditors have issued a going concern opinion the companys ability to remain a going concern is highly dependent on its ability to raise sufficient debt andor equity capital among other things no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business  we use electronic information technology it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events business disruptions could affect our operating results a significant portion of our development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot attract more optical customers to purchase our products we may not be able to increase or sustain our revenues our future success will depend on our ability to migrate existing customers to our new products and our ability to attract additional customers some of our present customers are relatively new companies the growth of our customer base could be adversely affected by · customer unwillingness to implement our products and services · any delays or difficulties that we may incur in completing the development and introduction of our products or product enhancements or service enhancements · the overall satisfaction of our customers · new product and service introductions by our competitors · any failure of our products to perform as expected or · any difficulty we may incur in meeting customers expectations the fluctuations in the economy have affected the telecommunications industry including broadband and internet telecommunications companies have cut back on their capital expenditure budgets which may continue to further decrease demand for various products and services this decrease may have an adverse effect on the demand for fiber optic sector and negatively impact the growth of our customer base risks relating to ownership of our securities our stock price may be volatile which may result in losses to our shareholders the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations and the market prices of companies listed on the otcpnk quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors including the following some of which are beyond our control · variations in our operating results · changes in expectations of our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors · changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry · additions or departures of key personnel and · future sales of our common stock domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance may adversely affect the price of our common stock  our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained although the trading price of our common shares increased significantly recently it has historically been sporadically or thinlytraded meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent this situation is attributable to a number of factors including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts stock brokers institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume even if we came to the attention of such persons those persons tend to be riskaverse and may be reluctant to follow purchase or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable as a consequence there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price we cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained or that current trading levels will be sustained the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price you may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all which may result in substantial losses to you shareholders should be aware that according to sec release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include  control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer  manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases  boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons  excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and  the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders we presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future if payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition the payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors we presently intend to retain all earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock if any to implement our business plan accordingly we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future in the past plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we may in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources  the elimination of monetary liability against our directors officers and employees under nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors officers and employees our articles of incorporation contains a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders further we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by nevada law we may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers which we may be unable to recoup these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions if successful might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the united states security  exchange commission sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of  our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties we have maintained

concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting responsibility estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures the objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework our management has concluded that as of july   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective this annual report does not include an attestation report of our companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting managements report was not subject to attestation by our companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit our company to provide only managements report in this annual report inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance interpretation of existing andor changing rules and principles segregation of management duties scale of organization and personnel factors internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate changes in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended july   that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting  item b

holdings corp ceocfomembers login september   issue ceocfo magazine   wireless broadband system providing rural southern new jersey consumers with better internet connectivity and greater bandwidth     mark stogdill president and ceo   hammer fiber optics holdings corp otc hmmr wwwhammerfibercom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine   ceocfo mr stogdill according to your site the broadband evolution has arrived what does that mean at hammer fiber optics holdings corp how are you part of it or maybe initiating the evolution mr stogdill  hammer fibers entire platform is centered around a tremendous broadband experience globally the us has always been considered to be at the forefront of data technology and internet service when compared to other countries in truth that presumption doesnt necessarily extend to national broadband access there still is a very large percentage of the country that is using a substandard type of internet connectivity all but really the most highly developed parts of the us are still without fiber optics there are a great many rural locations throughout all of the united states and even in southern jersey where we have our operations that are getting service that is either running off of legacy copper or hybrid fibercopper cable systems this is essentially lower capacity plant that was placed several years ago or longer in some cases people are still paying high premiums for this service and not getting the type of bandwidth that they need bandwidth demand in todays market is being driven by streaming media and even more recent the internet of things where all of the devices in our home are now connected bandwidth usage is increasing year over year as a result and capacity planning becomes an issue for most networks i dont think any customer should be left behind    ceocfo how does hammer fiber create a different experience mr stogdill hammer fibers differs from other wireless and fixedline service providers because of our revolutionary last mile architecture which is comprised of a wireless system which we call hammer wireless hammer wireless replaces the last mile access network in a traditional cable model with high capacity wireless end links that overcome many of the challenges all major operators are faced with today instead of using old copper or incurring the massive capital expenditure of building fiber to the home what we do is use our wireless technology to provide service directly to the consumer over a short distance from a wireless base station is that fed from a fiber backbone as a result of this type of convergence the system can push fiberlike speeds from the base station to a high number of end points many people live in rural or suburban markets that only have perhaps one provider who is providing their services through older types of plant the customer is still paying a very high market price for that but they are getting a lot of these up to speeds that never really hit their advertised marks at least not enough to satisfy the bandwidth demand of most modern consumers what we do is we push as much bandwidth as the customer needs in a fully burstable internet model so that as the customer is initiating new ip requests they are drawing bandwidth out of a very large pool of bandwidth so that they are never without enough bandwidth to run all the many different applications and all the many different devices off of the same modem in their home we see this system as a solution to a very salient market problem    ceocfo you said they are drawing bandwidth from a large pool does that mean you have a lot of capacity mr stogdill one of the things that hammer does that is a little bit different in the business space as it currently stands is we do not use contention ratios in our access network that translates to no oversubscription on the wireless system it essentially means that service does not slow down during peak usage hours the throughput on the network is always high and the bandwidth is always there on demand many customers complain about experiences with their providers and it always seems to be the same complaint seven oclock at night they are home with their family watching some type of streaming service and they experience buffering or they experience packet loss where pixels are dropping out of the frame with hammer customers we are continually pushing very large amounts of bandwidth both in nonpeak and peak times so that the experience is very consistent and smooth no matter when you are using it   ceocfo has the wireless component been tried previously what are the challenges in making it workable mr stogdill it has been tried before to not much overall success but it is clearly still where it is all going recently it has been in the press that several major providers companies that you have heard of are running into traditional fiber access challenges therefore everyone from the biggest players in the market to the smallest are looking for some type of wireless advantage what differentiates our product is that it runs a full docsis spec it feels and operates exactly like a traditional cable system and we are able to aggregate as much bandwidth as a traditional direct fiber or direct copper connection would generate so that from the customer experience side it is almost invisible to the customer that they are using a wireless product at this point most of the wireless technology being deployed is wireless backhaul or ptp connections wireless in this day and age can be so much more than just doing information backhauling it can actually be used to go direct to the consumer our technology takes all of the best elements of some of the existing technologies and provides an actual access system that can run off of a wireless connection that provides wiredlike service this means that the customer gets all of that fixedline service experience without all of the issues of having to build out a full cable plant digging up roads right of ways and all that type of stuff   ceocfo could you license the technology to larger companies that are having problems mr stogdill we certainly can and we are in the process of working on a platform so that we can make this product ubiquitous and that everyone especially rural operators who are right now deeply entrenched in these types of access challenges can utilize this technology and deployment architecture to really drive their own subscriber base and create a much higher quality of service than they can currently offer on their current generation technology that is definitely part of our plans   ceocfo does anyone care if it is a wireless component as long as the service is working well does wireless have any negative connotation in this arena these days mr stogdill i dont think there is quite the same stigma these days on wireless distribution as there was a few years ago much of the industry and most of the consumers are already thinking that way with satellite and cellular technologies being universally recognized at this point i think most people sort of expect that the next generation of connectivity to the home is going to come from some form of wireless platform for us the challenge is overcoming some of the negative stereotypes that have existed in the market space from previous attempts at wirelesstothehome such as wimax there also could be confusion about our product being equated with satellite satellite has its own challenges in terms of product branding to consumers however the difference with us is that this is a fully terrestrial network our network architecture is bringing all of the power of fiber to very strategic locations and then shooting this wireless signal over a very short condensed range this overcomes many of the obstacles that for instance satellite has experienced with latency and rain fade at the end of the day the customer is going to be mostly concerned about the quality of their service people are willing to take a chance on different types of technology as long as the end result is what they are looking for i think with this product it will meet or exceed all of the customers expectations the fact that there is a wireless component to the system shouldnt dissuade the many customers who are really looking for a better internet service   ceocfo will you be selling direct to the customer what is the ultimate business model mr stogdill selling direct to the customer is the primary platform we have approximately four hundred miles of fiber connectivity throughout new jersey which feeds our wireless base stations presently we are testing this product on absecon island which is atlantic city ventnor margate and long port we have wireless base stations already deployed in these markets and are in the final stage of beta testing the system we have customers on the network now and the experience has been very positive by the end of the year we are looking for a full commercial launch in atlantic city ventnor and margate as the program matures we are going to be looking to move into adjacent markets as well as markets throughout the state where it makes sense for us to roll the service out although we are working behind the scenes on a variety of service platforms in an array of verticals we are an operator first and foremost and we are looking to provide the service directly to the consumer that said there are many other possibilities with the technology that we are actively pursuing   ceocfo what have you learned as you have been testing the product mr stogdill i think the most important lesson is that there really is a need for competitive diversity that alternatives to the existing marketplace specifically how people are getting their internet and phone and video service is genuinely something that consumers by and large are craving there seems to be a bit of complacency in terms of content and ip delivery throughout the country customers are continually looking for better and better experiences they do not just want to be a number they want to have their service issues matter they want to have them addressed immediately customer service is a huge priority for us it is very important that we build relationships with our customers that they understand that their quality of service matters to us and that we seek and strive to do everything we can to provide them with the best service possible we are finding there is a shift in thinking and more customers than ever are holding their service providers accountable additionally we are discovering there are still markets in this country even ones just outside of major metropolitan areas where the service offerings are far below the par for what it should be in this day and age there is still room for the industry to improve as a whole and we are looking to play our part in driving a better bandwidth service   ceocfo you hear talk often about the rural markets and the underserved markets but it seems that nothing ever gets done how is hammer fiber really going to make it happen why are you confident where no one else seems to have succeeded mr stogdill it is easy for companies to say that theyve found a solution when the bulk of their subscribers are plucked from the density of metro markets it is easy to say okay we are going to expand out and we are going to dedicate resources and we are going to build a better product however the truth of the matter is the product has not arrived yet in most publicized cases it may take years to arrive if ever one of the reasons we can do this and do it now is that we have a product ready we arent in the trenches trying to develop the solution its already here and its one that is extremely well suited to specifically serve these types of communities at a very low cost factor in fact we can provide the same quality of service to a metro customer as we can to a rural customer and there is really no difference across the platforms using a wireless distribution system as opposed to all of the hassle of building out a cable network allows us to deploy these base stations in many more regions and reach many more customers in shorter amounts of time executing this type of game plan really comes down to the right product we have the right product to address these needs and we are making it a very big focal point of our platform   ceocfo will potential customers understand do people care mr stogdill there are two sides to this coin first we hope that the industry really takes notice of how to move forward in these markets that have been traditionally underserved we want the industry to notice how we are doing this and we seek to lead the charge for the next generation of hybrid wired and wireless deployments however i also think that from just your everyday consumers perspective they are mostly interested in the service hitting the high notes they expect we win customers through quality of service they may not be interested in how we got there or what we do behind the scenes to make it all happen for them the aim isnt to dazzle anybody with the back office network stuff  its to provide great service at the end of the day im not sure it matters to them how it gets there    ceocfo what did you learn from verizon that has helped you at hammer fiber optics holdings mr stogdill i think that verizon for the size company it is is a very well run organization it has a great game plan its fttp service was designed to provide the type of bandwidth that we talked about previously and where it is deployed its seems to be a huge success like any major operator it is burdened surely by the volume of customers it has and needs to serve i think if anything that although i get the still relevant principals of using fiber in terms of using the traditional plant to create access pieces on portions of your network i see the downside it seems to me building fiber out to every home is an untenable proposition one that is costly both in time and resources some of verizons fiber initiatives have stalled out in certain markets and i imagine it comes down to the return on their investment what we have learned is that wireless is sort of moving that roi in the right direction while still maintaining the same types of service levels      ceocfo how are you able to perhaps be better in weather situations and with electricity surges in some of what is uncontrollable and often not handled well from traditional providers are there advantages in your approach mr stogdill at the end of the day the internet is a best efforts practice i think there has been a lot of disillusionment on the customer side when the internet does fail for any reason that there is a notion that service should never fail and that the operators are not doing enough to rectify the problem this is an unrealistic expectation but its compounded by the fact that the operators really are not doing enough and there should be a greater focus on customer service and minimizing down time should be the central theme of any consumer grade platform that has to be the first and foremost objective to continually maintain and operate the network in a way that we ensure we are being as responsive as possible to any types of blips or burps in the distribution so that we can react very quickly to the market that we understand that every second a customer is down is a growing inconvenience to them and that ultimately what we need to do is to take responsibility for putting each one of them back in service promptly as far as the technology goes we are getting very a high quality of service rating in all different types of weather the reliability is as good or better than just about any product out there however like any system you will experience outages what we are trying to do as a platform as a business is focus intensely on customer service and customer response time we do that by trying to create shorter windows of response we are trying to create an atmosphere and a culture within the business that the customer needs to always come first and that it is our priority we want to relay that message back to them by example we want to demonstrate through action that when we say customer service matters that customer service truly matters        ceocfo would you tell us about being a public company how that may have changed hammer what the reception has been in the marketplace and then why people should invest mr stogdill from a corporate perspective everything has naturally changed from a business strategy standpoint nothing really has the goals are still the same the move to go public was very important in order to create visibility in the financial markets as we simultaneously seek to gain visibility in the consumer markets to what we are doing and how we are doing it we felt it was time to responsibly grow the business and move it forward we now have access to larger capital markets and a more diverse pool of investors we also wanted to create a liquidity event for our shareholders many of the original employees are shareholders so this way we can add some extra value to their immense efforts we take the responsibility of being public very seriously we were originally funded by private investors who placed great faith in our ability to execute and we carry that with us every day and that commitment has only grown since going public we owe it to them to see the vision through to complete success if anything it has made us very conscious about the impact of our products and services we are really looking to drive these markets where there is a lot of opportunity so we can build value and reward that faith     bandwidth demand in todays market is being driven by streaming media and even more recent the internet of things where all of the devices in our home are now connected bandwidth usage is increasing year over year as a result and capacity planning becomes an issue for most networks i dont think any customer should be left behind mark
