gentlemen and welcome to the tesla first quarter  financial results qa call operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to your host mr jeff evanson mr evanson you may beginjeff evanson tesla inc  vp of ir thank you sherry and good afternoon everyone im joined today by elon musk jb straubel deepak ahuja jon mcneill and lyndon rive and today on our webcast well discuss our q results that are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast and during our call we will discuss our business outlook make some forwardlooking statements these are all based on our predictions and expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the secwell start todays call with some brief remarks from elon and then well jump right into qa operator instructionsand with that ill turn it over to you elonelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect thanks so yes welcome to the call and id like to welcome deepak ahuja back to tesla as cfo and yes its  welcome backread moredeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo thank you elon appreciate that and im really excited to be backelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect cool all right so yes well just go right into qa overall im very proud of tesla for our accomplishments in the first quarter and i think second quarters going to be great too and yes so overall i think were executing well and im feeling quite optimistic about the futurejeff evanson tesla inc  vp of ir all right sherry lets have the first question pleasequestions and answersoperator our first question comes from alex potter with piper jaffrayalexander eugene potter piper jaffray companies research division  principal and senior research analyst theres been a fair amount of debate recently both amongst investors i think but also within the supply chain about the segments within the transportation ecosystem that will sort of forever be offlimits to tesla because of physical limitations of electric drivetrain specifically as it relates to weight and energy density and things of that nature presumably youd disagree but id be interested in hearing maybe why you disagree why you think tesla can compete in those segments whereas other people think diesel or fuel cells or other options would be betterelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect are you thinking of things like heavy truckingalexander eugene potter piper jaffray companies research division  principal and senior research analyst for instance yes thats  i mean i guess different people draw the line in different areas but as an example yeselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes i mean im not sure  im absolutely confident that the electric car trains will  electric vehicles will occupy everything without exception and i dont want to jump the gun on the tesla semitruck announcement were unveiling later this year but its  i think its going to be a cool product and will defy peoples expectations on what an electric truck can do so i really do not see any segment of transport that will not be electric in fact im highly confident that all transport will go fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets yes if you know your way around newtons third lawalexander eugene potter piper jaffray companies research division  principal and senior research analyst right okay and then i guess maybe one model  question here i know its maybe early days is there in a way to gauge sort of what you think the trim and option uptake is going to look like on the model  just to give folks an idea on what the pricing and margin profile might look likeelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i mean its really guesswork at this point but if it were to be comparable to what we see with say model s or with other vehicles in the market its something like a  to  increment over the inaudible would be the typical average jon do you have anyjonathan mcneill tesla inc  president of global sales and service yes i think thats right and thats  we experience a little bit higher than that in model s and model s in comparison to model  has more range has more power has more cargo et cetera and well be introducing at the start of production i think well be announcing our vehicle  as we get closer to the start of production what these vehicle stacks will be but i think  is a fair number to useelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes actually just to reemphasize that i might repeat this a few times on the call we want to be super clear that model  is not version  of our car the model  is essentially a smaller more affordable version of the model s with fewer features but the model s and the model  will be at the same level of technology and if you were to  if you were to put a version on say what  i would say probably on version  of model s and model  will also be version  if you make it like the essentially a first  when model s first came out it was rearwheel drive and then we had dual motor allwheel drive we had initial hardware  autopilot and then hardware  autopilot and there was a facial refresh there have been roughly  versions of model s and were on the fourth version model  will also be version  its a little confusing because ones a letter and the others a number and model  was supposed to be called the model e but then ford threatened to sue us and then i thought were being all clever by calling it the model  but actually the jokes on me because it caused confusion in the marketplace so were doing our best to clear up that confusion so people do not think that model  is somehow superior to model s actually model s will be better than model  as it should be because its a more expensive car were going to be  sound like a broken record on this front and the messaging might get a little annoying but we really have to be emphatic to clear up an error which i think is my responsibility in naming something that inherently would cause confusion with marketingoperator our next question comes from toni sacconaghi with bernsteinam sacconaghi sanford c bernstein  co llc research division  senior analyst i was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investors should think about battery costs i think your last public statement was that teslas battery cost early last year was under  per kilowatt hour if we look at how powerwall  theres been significant improvement in cost per kilowatt and in density but i think if we try and do the math on powerwall  wed still come up with a number thats reasonably high so maybe can help us  i think in the past elon youve said that you hope to get to  per kilowatt hour by  and i recognize thats aspirational but maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today what kind of improvement youre seeing from  or expect to see with  batteries in vehicles going forwardelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i mean regarding numbers for cost inaudible are close how competitive is the information except that we do expect to see significant improvements yearoveryear as much as improving the core chemistry of the cell reducing essentially the cell mass that is inactive and of course mass economies of scale and vertical integration at the gigafactory these will all take time to bear fruit but there will be significant time with the powerwall the  there are a bunch of other costs in the powerwall that are more than just the battery cost so youve got the  you have the cell cost and you have  and you get the cell into a module youve got all the cooling systems the control systems the safety stuff that prevents a runaway the enclosure the modem to communicate to the internet and then inaudible would be the power electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the ac or dc power of the house keys jb is there something youd like to add to thatjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto no thats a great description its a fully integrated product its a system not just a bunch of cells so when you  if youre maybe trying to calculate dollar per kilowatt or the cost of the powerwall i think youd find its extremely competitive against other home energy storage systems we believe the best but there is a lot of other hardware in there thats all included all wrapped together in the powerwall price so you dont have to piecemeal the system in your houseelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect right but were quite confident that the powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowest cost of anything in the market so that is a good product and i feel good feel pretty happy with itjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto and some of the improvement trajectory that you saw from powerwall  to powerwall  part of that is made possible by the migration to  cells made at gigafactory not all of it but a large part of it so that is something were pleased with and feel its going wellam sacconaghi sanford c bernstein  co llc research division  senior analyst okay i was wondering also your customer deposits and i recognize theres a lot in that declined for the second straight quarter and at least by my math it appears as though teslas new car inventory has increased substantially over the last couple of quarters maybe  units or about  even though sort of production and deliveries have been relatively constant im wondering if you are seeing incremental demand pressure on model x and particularly model s elon you underscored that there was confusion in the marketplace and are these the metrics that are suggesting to you that theres some confusion in the marketplace are you seeing cancellations because at least optically it looks like the booktobill is less than  on s and xdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo yes deepak here a couple of questions that you had firstly just to clarify inaudible weekly inventory inaudible very slightly from end of q to end of q and the  and we are using some of that in different ways and jon can explain that further and also to your other question on customer deposits what im seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of model xs and as our production of model xs has stabilized and as our mix of model s has increased relative to x we have cleared that so its nothing unusual from what im seeing there and jon do you want to add on thejonathan mcneill tesla inc  president of global sales and service thats right the increase in inventories is about split in  one is we increased model x test drive vehicles by about  over the past quarter we had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up model x production and prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second our stores have finally gotten their test drive fleets and thats what you see in terms of the half of the unit volume increase the second half is in our service loaners so as our installed fleet has gone up we need  we wanted to make sure that our owners were getting a service loaner and well continually increase that and youll see that over time thats not a onetime event youll see as we continue to deliver this level of cars per quarter that we will increase the service loaner fleet proportionally so that weve got the ability to offer a tesla to our customerselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes and in fact thisll take us a few months to fully deploy but our policy for service loaners is that the service loaner fleet will be the very best version of a tesla that is available so if you have a model x that comes in for service the service loaner you will get will be the absolute fully loaded stateoftheart pd ludicrous best model x that we have the same for the model s so it will be the kind of thing where you hope that service takes a long time because you have the absolute topoftheline tesla as a service loaneram sacconaghi sanford c bernstein  co llc research division  senior analyst so elon just to clarify the confusion that you believe exists between potentially model  and model s thats not being inferred from order patterns thats being inferred more qualitatively from what youre learning in showrooms or how do you make that assessment of the problemelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect there are no  we have seen some impact of model s orders as a function of people being confused that model  is the upgrade to model s now we took action to correct that about a month ago but that message has not filtered down to all of our customers so theres still a lot of people who are under the impression that model  is the upgrade from model s but in fact the one upgrade is just by the latest model s thats the actual upgrade not  like saying  thinking that the upgrade path from an audi a is an audi a its not so yes so its just a question of correcting that misconception which im confident well be able to do in the next several weeksoperator our next question comes from colin langan with ubscolin langan ubs investment bank research division  director in the general industrials group and analyst youve talked about in the past reinventing the machine that makes the machine and now that were getting a little bit closer to the model  launch any additional color on what steps in automation youre doing for the model  and any rough order of magnitude of how much more automated the model  would be versus the traditional production lineelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes so with model  i think would be roughly comparable with the best highvolume vehicle production lines in the world better in some respects a little worse than others but roughly comparable and then with some further iteration i think it will probably be a little bit better than the nextbest automotive production line then where things will really be a step change i think beyond any other automated actually will be the model y factory and this is both a function of designing the product to be easy to manufacture and easy to automate as well as designing the factory itself so model y is where i think it really becomes a step change but model  is going to be at or probably slightly better than i think the next best automotive inaudible thats pretty inaudible and then model y will be  therell be nothing close to it i thinkjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto maybe just to add as a relative benchmark against the s and the x the model  is vastly more automated and perhaps its not the best benchmark for you looking forward its perhaps  to x more automated than an s or an x and much more simpler to buildelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect is that  of the hours per carjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto yeselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect so its x the volume but the same hours per carcolin langan ubs investment bank research division  director in the general industrials group and analyst got it and as a followup any color on  youve announce the doubling of the supercharger network and increasing your dealers i mean how should we think about that over the next few years is that doubling going to be enough or how do you see the network needing to expand going forwardelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well its exciting that supercharger network substantially hit that number just recently and you can see the growth plan on our website thats going to continue to increase dramatically jon do you want to speak to servicejonathan mcneill tesla inc  president of global sales and service yes service locations are what you see increasing in the shareholder letter but you should probably think about service capacity in  ways now one of the things weve discovered as weve deployed more advanced service techniques into our centers is that a super majority of the cars that we repair dont require a lift that frees us from brickandmortar service and weve added substantially now to our mobile service capability starting first experimenting in the bay area and in some of our major markets and well be rolling that out throughout the year and so were creating service capacity in  ways  mobile service and fixed service operations but fixed service operations are becoming much much more efficientelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect much higher throughputjonathan mcneill tesla inc  president of global sales and service absolutely much higher throughput per worker more throughput per square foot across really every metricoperator our next question comes from adam jonas with morgan stanleyadam michael jonas morgan stanley research division  md elon first questions is on cfius and tencent so after acquiring this  passive stake in the company im thinking given the highly sensitive nature of your proprietary tech and computer vision ai robotics et cetera and all the related infrastructure i would imagine that the commission for foreign investment in the united states and the pentagon might be concerned at the idea of a chinese or a potentially chinese statebacked company going any further than a small passive stake am i watching too many cold war movies here or is there potential for some sensitivity on the grounds of national securityelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well i think  is not that big of a deal i mean theyre not present at board meetings they dont have any insight into tesla thats not publicdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo yes as elon said this is a passive investment and it doesnt require cfius clearance from that point of view again they dont have any access to confidential information or board materials so its just a belief and the support of what they think tesla can achieveadam michael jonas morgan stanley research division  md okay and just as a followup apple has enough net cash i think to buy tesla like more than x over is there anything that apple does or has besides having more money than they know what to do with that could be helpful in teslas mission to accelerate the transition to shared autonomy in sustainable transport could they be the type of firm you could partner with and could you  is this something you could talk to tim aboutelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes i dont think they want to have that conversation i dont believe  theres not been any indication that they do but obviously apples company makes some great product and yes i mean i use their phone and their laptop its cooladam michael jonas morgan stanley research division  md i mean do you think of them more a competitor than potential partner is that unfairelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i mean i dont know what theyre going to do on the car front yes its not clearoperator our next question comes from tyler frank with robert bairdtyler charles frank robert w baird  co incorporated research division  associate can you walk me through what your capital needs are for the model  just to get to production and then to ramp production throughout this year and next year and then how confident are you that you might be able to hit that unit production target for the model  in this year and then i have a followup after thatdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo i dont think we have indicated the  we have just said in the letter well achieve  per week at some point this year and  at some point next year so we havent clarified on that soelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes the trick with the  when youve got a whole new product and a whole new factory is i dont predict exactly what the  what that initial scurve look  initial push in the scurve looks like its extremely difficult in every way the production starts off slowly and then you gradually eliminate the constraints and eventually it starts taking off exponentially but because of that sort of initial slow ramp that then goes exponentially  its more changed in where that lands in the quarter it can have quite a big impact on total volume its a lot easier to predict where the upper flat portion of the scurve is likely to be but predicting the rapidly changing portion of the scurve is just i think not within the ability of anyone to predict with accuracytyler charles frank robert w baird  co incorporated research division  associate got it and then can you just run us through what the capital needs are sort of to hit that unit per week goal as well as where the battery factory stands in terms of its current capacity versus its expected total capacity and what time line is to get to that total capacity markdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo well we feel pretty good overall about the capital needs and our ability to fund that to achieve that  per week capacity andelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect with internaldeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo yes with internal  right exactly with our own resources and the cash that we generate from our business as we ramp up model  volumes and overall and jb can speak up more to that in terms of the cell capacity thats all lined up to come in  come online just ahead of our needs on the vehicle side as well as on the energy storage sidejeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto and we initially forecast about  gigawatt hours of cell capacity and  gigawatt hours of pack capacity and we anticipate to surpass that cell capacity in  so thats going well and with the increasing improvements in the production density and speed at the gigafactory we actually ultimately believe and i think weve said this before that we can fit substantially more capacity than the  gigawatt hours at gigafactory  soelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes and weve said publicly that we think cell capacity at gigafactory  is likely to exceed  gigawatt hours over timejeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto so the end stage of  is really sort of a passing point at this stage and will continue on from thereelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes yestyler charles frank robert w baird  co incorporated research division  associate right okay and then elon you had previously pulled out a target of  million cars per year by  do you still think thats achievable and what needs to take place in order to get thereelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes i do i think we need to come up with the model y sometime in  or aspirationally late  and then i think that  million units is quite likely  combined yes maybe moreoperator our next question comes from david tamberrino with goldman sachsdavid j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc research division  associate analyst i wanted to first just ask about the order rate for the s and the x in the quarter and also get some color around your deliveries from a regional perspective i believe there was an expiration of an electric vehicle tax credit in hong kong im just wondering if that created any pull forward or incremental demand in the quarter and if theres any air pocket to orders and deliveries for the second quarter seeing that you maintained your  to  h delivery guidanceelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes i mean there was some pull forward demand in hong kong thats  city on earth so the inaudible impact our ability to achieve our delivery target for qdavid j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc research division  associate analyst and the order rate growth for the quarterelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well the  i think we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the k roughly k total for the year for s and x combined thats where we kind of want to be the manufacturing system at the supply chain is all sort of set up for that level we continue to be surprised by how sort of frankly naive people are  a lot of you are about production and supply chain its as though  it sounds like an easy way to increase production its truly not you cant  at any given production system you design it for optimal output and then you aim to improve efficiency reliability quality and so forth at that output so the s and x system as i said last year was designed for  units and initially to get to that rate we have to use a lot of overtime a lot of expediting and that affected our gross margin on the car and now were sort of at steadystate with the kind of the top part of that scurve that were targeting and so now our focus for s and x is improving production efficiency continuing to improve quality andjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto material costelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes material cost and so forth to sort of  and to get the right amount of gross margin for s and x to go to the  level that weve been aspiring to for a whiledavid j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc research division  associate analyst understood thats on the production side my question was just on the what the order rates and demand was looking like from what youre seeing on your customer base historically youve given or provided a very helpful color on what the yearoveryear or quarteroverquarter order growth rate has been on the s and the x and i think its a meaningful metric for what demand looks like for those vehicles and for your products but thats okay understoodelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i dont think its meaningful were going to produce  units approximately so all that matters is theres demand is there going to be demand for  units i believe there will be and there isdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo and there certainly sufficient demand for the guidance weve given for the first halfelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yesdavid j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc research division  associate analyst understood and just on the solarcity side it looked like a pretty good gross margin quarter i wanted to understand how much of that was from the shift further into the cash loan versus the ppa lease and how much was that or was it more associated with the ramping of the gigafactory and production of the cellsdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo it was primarily seasonality we had inaudible production happen in the northern hemisphere in some of the ppa leases and how we recognize revenue and also it was we had some  million sale of energy credits that helped us and the credit sale is a sale that happen every quarter but we have the full quarter of it which we didnt have in our half quarter of solarcity sales  financials in our tesla income statementlyndon r rive solarcity corporation  cofounder and ceo and plus weve seen an increase in cash and earnings that improved the margin as welldeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo yes that does help the margin as well yesdavid j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc research division  associate analyst im sorry to ask one more but that was a bit inaudible could you repeat that lyndonlyndon r rive solarcity corporation  cofounder and ceo yes weve actually seen an increase in the tesla line businesselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect were going to get the majority of the cash and loan by the end of the yearjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto correctelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect so just to be clear for inaudible activity wed like it to get to the majority of the cash and loan by the end of the yeardeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo and we expect the solar margins to stay very healthy for the rest of the year and grow over timeoperator our next question comes from martin viecha with redburnmartin viecha redburn europe limited research division  research analyst this is martin from redburn i wanted to ask about the pep talk that you had a few days ago where you talked about level  maybe in the next  years and i was wondering that its probably going to change radically the design of the car inside and whether you foresee this in the next  years that the interior design would change quite dramaticallyelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i dont think the  were going to see a dramatic change in interior design there may be an option where you have club seating instead of everyone facing forward but i wouldnt call that radical just turning seats around and im not sure how much people obviously would want to do that i mean the sensor hardware and compute power required for at least to have a  to a level  autonomy has been in every tesla producer since october of last year approximately so its a matter of upgrading the software and looking to level  and if it does turn out that we need to upgrade the compute power its designed to be easy to upgrade basically access through the glove box and plug in a more powerful computer so we dont think it will be but if it is thats pretty easy to do so the important thing to appreciate is that the sensor hardware and wiring harnesses necessary for autonomy which is essentially having the  cameras the radar and ultrasonics thats in place so that with each passing release the cars autonomy level will improve we had a bit of a dip obviously because of the unexpectedly rapid transition away from mobileye where wed expected to have the mobileye chip on the board as we transitioned but mobileye refused to allow that so then we had to basically recreate all the mobileye functionality in about  months which we didmartin viecha redburn europe limited research division  research analyst okay and then the other followup question that i had was on the model y you mentioned that the model  production line will be probably as fast or a bit faster than the fastest production line in the world and model y will be the genuine step change does that mean that the model y will be made on a different platform than the model elon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect it will be yes different platform just one example but the wiring harness on model s is about  kilometers in length the wiring harness on model  is  kilometers in length the wiring harness on model y will be  meters and thats a redundant wiring harness so really wiring harness is basically a flex harness with a high bit rate bus so you can put everything on a higher bit rate bus that doesnt  a can bus where you  your data rate isnt necessarily constrained and we will also have make changes to the vestigial voltage so that not everything is  volts which is a pretty absurd number really its wrong for everythingoperator our next question comes from brian johnson with barclaysbrian arthur johnson barclays plc research division  md and senior equity analyst yes i have a couple questions a housekeeping one and then sort of kind of where are you kind of a question for elon on the housekeeping your order delivery announcements at the end of the quarter you used to make delivery announcements  you used to talk about deliveries to end customers this quarter it was just deliveries to customers is there any change in distribution channel potentially using resellers in some markets that thats meant to communicatejeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto no it is the same thing its consistent we are delivering to individual customersbrian arthur johnson barclays plc research division  md and senior equity analyst okay second a couple of years ago when the stock was at  in an answer to one of my questions elon you outlined a scenario where you could get to  billion in market cap thats about where apple was at the time were  years later youre obviously close to the model  launch how are you looking at thatelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well now  i mean i want to preface this by  of course i could be completely delusional but i think i see a clear path to that outcomebrian arthur johnson barclays plc research division  md and senior equity analyst okay and anything else in terms of other businesses or volume or still pretty much on that trackelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect the set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious and heavily involve tesla getting incredibly good at the machine that builds the machine  which involves by the way a tremendous amount of software this is  its not just a bunch of robots sort of sitting there its the programming of the robots and how they interact and its far more complex than the software in the car i mean i think this is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy i probably wouldnt know what to do if i were in that positionbrian arthur johnson barclays plc research division  md and senior equity analyst okay and just one quick question why pickup trucks why semis before pickup truckselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well theyre not going to be that widely separated in time and part of it is we do want to show that electric transport can do even the most heavyduty things in the world so its  i think its pretty obvious that we can do a pickup truck but its not obvious to a lot of people that we can do a heavyduty semi and so just being able to kind of hit the corners of the box of capability its a helpful thing to do yesjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto maybe ill add a point but a disproportionate amount of petroleum is actually burned by a small number of trucks just because of the high utilization the high miles per vehicle and it really lends itself i think well to electrificationelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes exactly every semi  i mean theres probably x as much hydrocondensate for a semi as for a pickup truckoperator our next question comes from rod lache with deutsche bankrod avraham lache deutsche bank ag research division  md and senior analyst a couple remaining questions just one is since the model  is maybe  or  months away could you just give us a sense of what some of the most critical outstanding items are that are going to gate the commercial launch timing and now that there are actual physical test vehicles on the road are there any significant changes happeningelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well actually it seems to be  were not really seeing any significant change that needs to occur with model  so its coming in as expected as the design continuation has predicted its getting pretty close to the bullseye and im not aware of anything that would affect our prior statements about volume targetrod avraham lache deutsche bank ag research division  md and senior analyst so theres nothing outstanding visàvis tooling deliveries or things like that that youre still viewing as a critical item with some uncertaintyelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect theres plenty of things with uncertainty but i dont know anything that would prevent us from starting firstly in july and exceeding  units per week by the end of the year there may be some cost up there i just dont know of what that is todayrod avraham lache deutsche bank ag research division  md and senior analyst got it just switching gears to china obviously domestic production is presumably very important to your success in that region china recently suggested that they may relax the rules for foreign ownership or that they intend to relax the rules for foreign ownership and i was wondering if you could just update us on where you stand visàvis the growth plans there and are the rules for ownership is that one of the gating factorselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i dont think this is quite the right timing to make any announcements on that front but i would expect us to define our plans more clearly by the middle of year with respect to china production i would  i think its good timing that  i mean the china rule changes are good timingrod avraham lache deutsche bank ag research division  md and senior analyst got it and just lastly unless theres a pretty huge q for capex it appears that youre tracking at less than that  billion number that you had articulated of capital spending prelaunch of model  is that a function of savings contractual timing or is that capacity issue just some thoughts on how we should be thinking about the capital spending relative to your prior targetsdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo yes its not too far from it rod and we are  we have significant capex in q and its done in a big lump sum or a little big peak given how much equipment is being installed and then tested often our capex payments happen  and a big chunk of the funding payments happen after the equipment is installed its tested and then we have fairly good customer payment terms in many cases its  days and so its just a matter of that process and timing and saying that we feel very comfortable in terms of how that is happening the spend and the installation and were all getting this for model elon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i mean if anyone comes on a tour of the factory its really insane how much equipment is arriving and getting installed and being brought online its really  and im used to seeing a lot of intense equipment it blows my mind like wow and i think youd also get kind of a visual sense for the improvement in manufacturing technology between s and x and  so you just go and look at it its like yup thats obviously betteroperator our next question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimercolin william rusch oppenheimer  co inc research division  md and senior analyst can you give us an update on the volume of cathode and anode thats been produced and shipped from the gigafactory at this pointelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect inaudible but its a lot i mean its  yes vast amount are you alluding to materials  potential material supply constraints or im not sure what youre getting atcolin william rusch oppenheimer  co inc research division  md and senior analyst yes im just trying to get a sense of the ramp at this point on the cathode and the anode in  at the gigafactoryelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i mean its ramping very inaudible were not really seeing anything inaudiblejeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto yes and i completely agree and were basically tracking slightly ahead of where we need to be on vehicles but thats sort of as was planned we dont want to be too far ahead or else wed have a pretty massive inventory issue showing up so we run it in batches and we run at high rates and then pause and validate the throughput but yes its where we expect it to becolin william rusch oppenheimer  co inc research division  md and senior analyst okay thats super helpful and then just shiftingelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect right and id like to express a note of appreciation to inaudible parts that are just working really well and theyre doing great stuffcolin william rusch oppenheimer  co inc research division  md and senior analyst okay and then shifting gears to the purchase accounting adjustments related to solarcity can we just get a sense of the nature of that it looked like you were going to go through a series of complex assessments over the course of the year with the solarcity acquisition just wanted to understand what that  million charge was and how we should think about those decisions getting made going forwarddeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo im not sure what the  yes the  million is the change quarteroverquarter that youre referring to and in q  and this is arcane purchase accounting note there was a gain on our purchase of solarcity and that was not there in q and there were some revaluation of assets at solarcity that was linked to that purchase and net of that was a  million walkoperator our next question comes from ryan brinkman with jpmorganryan j brinkman jp morgan chase  co research division  senior equity research analyst what do you think are likely to prove the biggest challenges or bottlenecks in ramping production to  vehicles per week by some point in  and how confident are you in your ability to overcome those challenges and then the shareholder letter also mentions a run rate of i think  or approaching  per week in  which would maybe seem to indicate some kind of an annual run rate of  or so model s and then given youre also tracking kind of  ss and xs do think that type of production can be handled out of the fremont facility or does your plan assume production in another facility as wellelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes the  yes all of that production is intended to be out of the gigafactory  and fremont so yes we believe that can all be handled here and far as specific constraints on model  i just dont know of anything that really stands out weve gone to great pains with the model  to design it for manufacturing and to not have all sorts of bells and whistles and special features that like for example like with x x became kind of like a technology bandwagon of every cool thing you can imagine all at once its like everything all at once that was a terrible strategy you really want to start off simple and add things over time but that was some hubris and real overconfident there so with model  its the opposite weve designed it to be easy to make weve got i think a much better supply chain in place where weve got the a team from the a suppliers we didnt have that for the model x or the s and as far as we know there are no issues so that strategy appears to be paying off but there could be something that weve missed that we just dont know about right nowryan j brinkman jp morgan chase  co research division  senior equity research analyst okay and you mentioned production in the gigafactory i know youre doing some component assembly there for the model  but given that it is on track to be the worlds largest factory or maybe even the worlds largest building is it such a stretch to think that you might be able to produce vehicles in that facilityelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect look just in terms of making battery cells modules packs motors and powertronics just on that basis  and of course the powerwall the powerpack on that basis alone it is effectively the largest building in the world of any kind i mean you could fit  pentagons more than  pentagons in the building  pentagons i dont know a lot and just in the gear factory its really difficult to appreciate the magnitude of the structure unless you actually visit it but inaudibleoperator our next question comes from john murphy with bank of americajohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst i just wanted to follow up on the capex topic i mean you guys did kind of fade down your expectation for capex ahead of  or in conjunction with a model  launch from  billion to  billion to  billion and then the spend this quarter was relatively low at least relative to what the run rate implied im just curious is there some level of capital efficiency that youre coming across and i mean and could you be possibly be significantly below this  billion number ahead of the launch or into the launchdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo were always trying to be capital efficient that is the underlying theme of every step we take and clearly some of that is part of it but i think overall would be  again because of this massive scale of payments whether its last week of june or first week of july how many inaudible we end up paying its hard to be precise its almost like an scurve of capital spend that were going through here so i dont think its any indication of anything else except timing at the highest level  beyond the capital efficiency that we are continually working onjohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst okay and then a second question i mean residuals seem to keep performing better than you were expecting is there any opportunity to potentially lower monthly lease payments to drive higher unit volume demand going forwardelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect actually i think one of the traps that the auto industry has gotten into into the past is having unrealistic residuals and then finding that theyre upsidedown typically when a recession came along we want to be very cautious about falling into that trap so yes were  yes we dont want to do that and sort of really an advantage that our cars have that cars in the past have not had no other car has is that the software keeps getting better so functionality we keep adding more and more functionality to the car even though the hardware stayed the same if the model s  if you bought a model s  years ago its way better than when you brought it and that really makes a difference for residualsoperator our next question comes from james albertine with consumer edgejames joseph albertine consumer edge research llc  senior analyst on the semi trucks just very quickly if i could ask is the attractiveness of that sort of vertical that you could sell sort of in bulk to fewer customers so more vehicles per customer and given your partnerships in the past would you envision partnering with a manufacturer on that side of the business or would this be more akin to your sort of go it alone strategy on the auto sideelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well manufacture that ourselves and most of that semi is actually made out of model  parts by the way its model   its actually using a bunch of model  motors probably revealing too much about the future of it but so were able to use a very high volume vehicle and then combine several motors to have something that i think is actually going to have a very good gross margin like its  thats just not something that any other  its like you cant do that with a traditional truck so effectively it allows us to have a very compelling product that has a low unit costjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto yes the incremental complexity of building that is much less than it might seemelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes exactlyjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto in terms of all the inaudibleelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes exactlyjames joseph albertine consumer edge research llc  senior analyst and are we right to think about that though as a contractual sort of opportunity right i mean you go to sort of a handful of fleet operators and you could sell sort of more vehicles per customer is that the right way to think about itelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect that is how it would occur yes so its essentially much more of a straightforward economic decision for the operators they just look at it as a cost per ton per mile economy and its like if its better theyll just buy a huge number and if its worse they wont buy hardly any and were confident itll be betterjames joseph albertine consumer edge research llc  senior analyst okay great and then if i just may followup on the demand questions that were sort of asked earlier wondering as youre getting more used vehicles back into the pipeline is there any data to support that youre using those vehicles to attract a potentially new customer to the brand or alternatively is there data that would suggest that perhaps could be cannibalizing some of the newer vehicles but sorry to dwell on demand but i just wanted to see if there was anything given now were a few years on and youre getting a lot of vehicles back offlease presumably if theres any indication there one way or the otherjonathan mcneill tesla inc  president of global sales and service i think its still early days theyre still at relatively low numbers but the indication is that were introducing a new customer to tesla at those lower price pointselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes exactly the demand actually increases really exponentially as price drops the  at one point when we looked at it i think we were looking at the right number but the demand at the model  price point appeared to be somewhere between x and x higher than at the model s price point well i mean you look at it like so theres  premium sedans sold in the us every year i think were about  of that but there are  million vehicles in total sold so premium sedans are like nothing less than  of the market james joseph albertine consumer edge research llc  senior analyst so a  series customer for  your brand new and a  series customer for your sort of used is maybe the right way to think about it is that fairjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto or a  series customer for the used as well yeselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect but it is interesting to consider that the magnitude of  this is really maybe underappreciated like consider  million cars and trucks sold in the us per year of which only  are premium sedans and we have a  market share if we can replicate that in other segments the results are obviousjeff evanson tesla inc  vp of ir okay before we go on to the next question i want to do just a time check here were at the hour mark we have  more analysts that want to ask questions do you want to go on for a little bit longer elonelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes we can go a little longeroperator our next question comes from brad erickson with pacific crest securitiesbradley d erickson pacific crest securities inc research division  research analyst marketplaces and lifestyle elon i think a couple years ago youd said you could envision at some point stepping away from tesla as ceo anyways towards the end of the decade as model  kind of got up and running as you were likely to be pursuing a lot of these adjacent opportunities clearly a lot still there on the horizon but now with some more of these opportunities being a part of teslas business does that change your view of staying actively in place with tesla longer into the futureelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well maybe i wasnt clear i intend to be actively involved with tesla for the rest of my life hopefully stopping before i get too old  or too crazy i dont know but essentially for as long as i can positively contribute to tesla i intend to be  to have a significant involvement with tesla but that doesnt mean i should be ceo forever its like  i think my main  so its like the most valuable thing i can contribute is kind of product design and technology but thats my forte thats what i like doing and thats what i would imagine doing in the sort of very long termoperator our next question comes from jeff osborne with cowen and companyjeffrey david osborne cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst just  questions one elon at the ted talks and i think a couple tweets you had talked about adding  gigafactories just following up to tyler franks question on capex needs can you just talk about what your ultimate vision of tesla over the next few years model y factory truck factories truck service centers  gigafactories china schedule is all of that going to be funded with internal cash or do you see partnerships funding despite the low margins that the battery industry has im just trying to get a sense of what your ultimate vision will costelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect right incremental dilution along the way its hard to say i mean im sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future its kind of a tradeoff between how fast do we want to grow versus  like we can grow slower with no dilution really for sure we could grow at a moderate pace with no dilution we could grow at a fast pace with some dilution or we can grow at a very fast pace with a high level of dilutionjeffrey david osborne cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst x growth in  years sounds pretty fast me but maybe not to youelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect well yes but you have to look and say going from  when we went from the roadster to the model s we went from making around  units a year to making  units a year so thats a hell of a good growth up by a factor of jeffrey david osborne cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst got it maybe just out of the interest of time the second question i had is just on  it would be helpful given that theres hundreds of thousands of people that have put a deposit on the model  can you just update us on what the cumulative us vehicles sold that you have relative to  number to get that  tax credit you mentioned elasticity of demand at certain price points but certainly theres a large contingent of people that put a deposit that unfortunately wont get the benefit so it would be nice just to be able to track that metric so as the  launches in the coming months we can see which folks will get that and what the impact of demand is for those that dontelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect i think most people are going to be able to get it that have put down a deposit and its just  its a physical problem yes its sort of the credit rolls off it just  its not like a complete close it rolls off over time and we are prioritizing us production which also helps us with keeping things simple so theres  were not making many versions of the car for many different countries yes and so i mean i think provided somebody is  i dont know my guess is probably most people that have put down a deposit will be able to get the full tax creditjeffrey david osborne cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst is there a way you could just give us what the cumulative numbers so far in the us quarter to date  or sorry inception to dateelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect no heres the problem if we do that then people run off and make all sorts of conclusions based on that that really have  that are not predictive of the future because there are no  you cant test drive a model  if you come into our stores and you want to buy a model  we try to get you to buy a model s or x instead we antisell the model  but i mean thats  reservations continue to climb week after week no advertising antiselling nothing to test drive still grows every weekdeepak ahuja tesla inc  cfo and maybe well try clarifying that under the present regime the income  the tax credits on the car continue even after we hit the  limit and they continue to sell in quarters but at a slightly lower depleting scale so its going to be beneficial for customers even beyond the  markelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes absolutely and i should perhaps touch again on this whole notion of  like ods has done all these sort of entertaining articles like tesla survived because of like government subsidies and tax credits drives me crazy heres what those fools dont realize if tesla is not alone in the car industry that  all those things would be material if we were the only car company in existence we are not there are many car companies what matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market and in fact the incentives give us a relative disadvantage this is inaudible in spite of the incentives not because of them and  but these incentives have limited lifetime and theyre limited scale  like for example the federal tax credit and then the  that caps out at the k the carb credits which the carb rules are woefully weak we can sell  there are some quarters where we cant even sell carb credits and when we can its maybe  on the dollar or something like that whereas the other car companies get to fully absorb the value of the carb credit so for example gives gm roughly  i count a  to  advantage over tesla for the chevy volt thats why like inaudible well gm appears to be losing  a car on the volt no theyre not theyre making it up in carb credits but they get the full retail value of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when were lucky but the carb credits only  are only effective at a production rate of about  to  vehicles a year so thats why youll see mark my words its not going to be any higher than that for the chevy volt thats the   on the order of  units a year or th of our initial production rate for the model  or th of what the model  will be next year so teslas competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away this is  it continues to be something that is not well understood and for that they dont  ill also mention that  the nevada tax credits which for the gigafactory it makes it sound like we got a  billion check from the state of nevada we did not those tax credits are made up  the vast majority of it is just sales and use tax abatement on equipment in the gigafactory taxes that otherwise wouldnt been there because there was just a bunch of rocks there before and you dont get a lot of taxes from rocks so thats why it is essentially a nolose proposition for the state and in order for us to actually earn  billion in tax credits for the gigafactory we have to generate over the course of  years about  billion in output from the gigafactory so yes its worth about like  and dont want to look a gift horse in the mouth and we appreciate it and thats nice but this is obviously   is not the difference between success and failure for the factory and  but a lot of articles write it in the past tense tesla received  billion no we havent we did not receive that its only  of that great well take it but i  looking at the bank now i just dont see it there thats because its just sales and use tax abatement over  years but the key takeaway is that as teslas competitive advantage improves with scale it doesnt get worseoperator our next question comes from joseph spak with rbc capital marketsjoseph spak rbc capital markets llc research division  analyst just a quick one on service by our math if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles youve delivered and the amount of stores and service stations its a little bit over  or something around  per i guess station and i realize youre adding some more of these mobile units but i just wanted to know bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at  million unit rate like what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleetjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto i think rather than thinking about store or service center locations we think about it in terms of mobile units and lifts and so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts so our initial service centers it might have had  or  lifts and were building now service centers with  to  sometimes  lifts and so theres a density within the service centers but the mobile capability expands that quite greatly so i think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided by locations because the locations varies so widely but thats essentially how were thinking about capacity and planning capacity and as deepak mentioned earlier our throughputs and efficiency are getting much better over time and well continue to improve those so its our goal to stay ahead of the installed base capacity so were providing great service but really the model  has been designed for high reliability and as elon has said many times the best service is no service at allelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect exactly were  our aspiration would be we make  service revenue because the car never needs  never breaksjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto absolutely and our service centers are sort of like the old maytag repairman yesoperator our next question comes from rob cihra with guggenheim partnersrobert george cihra guggenheim securities llc research division  md and senior analyst two quick questions i guess if i could one just on energy your megawatt hours declined sequentially which just seemed surprising thinking demand is well above supply still at this stage so when we could expect any more meaningful ramp there and then separately on automotive given that you seem to be in the mood to talk about future unveils which is great any chance i could push that by asking about the future urban transport bus not sure what you want to refer to it as but the reason i ask is not  is because that one seems a lot less about the product and more about just a completely different model for transportation and requiring full autonomy and that sort of thing i mean is that the kind of thing youre thinking  years now or  years now or anything in betweenelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect sure with respect to the battery stuff its a little lumpy right now because youre at a big installation in fourth quarter with southern california edison and then we had a bit of a gap between the powerwall  to powerwall  so we should start to see that correcting in q and q and then particularly towards the end of this year i would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment like really dramaticjeffrey b straubel tesla inc  cto yes and its worth pointing out that we do still have a significant backlog in powerwall demand and then were building capacity to address that and ramping it we had a few challenges in parts of the supply chain as weve been ramping that throughout the quarter the first quarter but those are freeing up and were seeing the production rates improve weekonweek but its a  yes its not indicative of demand its really our challenges of ramping the new productselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect yes like i say i feel really good about quite dramatic quarteroverquarter increases i think with  well for every quarter i can imagine the future its going to be really dramatic increases in stationary storage output it will grow faster than the car volume and the car volume is growing pretty fastrobert george cihra guggenheim securities llc research division  md and senior analyst okay and the buselon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product architect on the bus yes having given a bit more thought to it i dont know if the bus thing  if thats actually going to be something that makes sense in the shared fully autonomous environment because it may  if you have a share  if it costs like very little like it costs less than a bus ticket to have  make use of a shared autonomy fleet to go wherever you want to point to point well why wouldnt you just use that so i dont know i dont know if the bus thing  it does helps with density to some degree but then you  i mean you could basically have something like a higher density model x or something like that thats got  or  seats in it but would you want more than that i dont know and then when you factor tunnels in  big round tunnels anyway  yes then the density  urban density in traffic and it can be fully alleviated with tunnels yes its more like the tunnel thing that we talked about that at ted and basically like the commentary afterwards was  it was like the critics  the most critical commentary was theres a group that thinks that the whole sort of automated tunnel with electric scaping  like well basically like the tunnel thing this group that says its obvious and theres a group that says its impossible and i would like those  groups to meet its been like sort of like theres a group thats like the flat earth society and the hollow globe society i think they should meet too have a debateoperator our final question comes from charlie anderson with dougherty  cocharles l anderson dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst i wonder you mentioned the antiselling before of the model  is there a level of production where you flip from antiselling to sellingelon r musk tesla inc  cofounder chairman ceo and product
