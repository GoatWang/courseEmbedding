owens realty mortgage inc acknowledges receipt of letter from freestone capital and issues owens realty mortgage inc acknowledges receipt of letter from freestone capital and issues response news provided by owens realty mortgage inc jun    et share this article walnut creek calif june   prnewswire  owens realty mortgage inc nyse mkt orm the company today announced that it has issued a letter in response to freestone capital managements june   open letter to the companys chairman and board of directors the full text of the letter follows june  freestone capital management llc fifth avenue suite seattle washington  total return performance dear mr furukawa on behalf of the board of directors of owens realty mortgage inc the company i am writing in response to your letter of june    we value the constructive conversations we have held with you over the years and appreciate your continued feedback perspective and interest in the company  considering our longstanding history of respectful engagement with you we were surprised to see your concerns aired in a public letter without first giving us an opportunity to discuss these matters with you privately  we remain open to continuing an ongoing engagement with you just like with any of our other stockholders  however in light of the numerous misleading and inaccurate statements and statistics in your public letter we feel compelled to set the record straight first and foremost we remain steadfastly committed to acting in the best interests of the company and all of its stockholders  as we announced earlier this week we have authorized a new  million stock repurchase plan and have increased our quarterly dividend  these actions were set in motion and referenced in our public filings and earnings calls long before your june  letter they were also heavily informed by extensive and ongoing stockholder discussions over a period of many months and indepth evaluations of the companys balance sheet and capital needs they demonstrate our continued commitment to thoughtfully and appropriately deploying capital to deliver immediate value to our stockholders  the announced repurchase plan on june th is the fourth authorized by the board in as many years and a clear illustration of the boards belief in efficiently deploying capital  over the past four years the company has repurchased  million of its stock and paid out  million in cash dividends going forward we will continue to opportunistically utilize these tools to close the valuation gap between our share price and book value contrary to your statement that the company has a history of trailing market returns relative to the two indices you selected we have generated significantly greater returns during the period from our initial public listing through april   the company has generated a total stockholder return of  significantly more than the returns generated by the ftse areit mortgage reit index and russell  index of  and  respectively during the period since our public listing on july   we have created net earnings of over  million or approximately  per share   as disclosed in our most recent annual report on form k we have also substantially outperformed the snl us finance reit index during the period from our initial public listing through the end of  the underlying cause of this discrepancy between your view and the reality of our financial performance results from your selective inclusion of data over a period that extends back over four years before owens realty mortgage was even a publicly listed company  the metric you cite total return to stockholders includes public stock price appreciation as an input variable and as this variable would not apply to the companys prepublic predecessor thereby artificially depressing the output your attempted inclusion of prepublic nontraded limited partnership performance data results in a highly misleading depiction of the value the company has actually generated for its public stockholders  with respect to the management agreement as we announced earlier this week our compensation committee has been engaged in a monthslong internal analysis related to our external management structure including possible amendments to the companys management agreement that would replace the current management fee payable to the manager with a management fee based on a stockholders equity calculation that is similar to industry standards or an internalization transaction  in an effort to conduct a thorough review the compensation committee hired a leading independent consultant fti consulting as an external compensation advisor at the outset of this process ultimately the conclusion the compensation committee reaches will be the product of a vigorous and analytical evaluation designed to maximize value for our stockholders although we appreciate your ideas about how to increase stockholder value we have serious concerns regarding the consequences of liquidation including adverse economic consequences negative tax implications and the potentially significant downward pricing pressure that arises in many liquidations  the board has been proactive  and will remain focused – on closing the gap between the companys stock price and book value  the companys stock repurchase program and increased quarterly dividend announced earlier this week are the most recent proofs of this commitment we also continue to believe the companys current strategy of disposing real estate assets in a responsible manner and reallocating the balance sheet from primarily real estate to commercial loan investments are the best methods of maximizing net returns and eliminating the valuation gap we would like to reiterate that the board values and will continue to welcome and take into account the views and opinions of all of our stockholders once again we thank you for your feedback and perspective regards william c owenschairman of the board this graph is a comparison of the cumulative total stockholder return on shares of the companys common stock the russell  index and the snl us finance reit index a published industry index from july   the
