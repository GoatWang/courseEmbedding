previously contemplated impact of lower energy and commodity prices despite challenging conditions in the global offhighway end markets allison demonstrated strong operating margins and free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation while closely aligning costs and programs across its business with current end market conditions and our strategic priorities examples of cost alignment and opportunities prioritization during the third quarter include the introduction of several new bus and coach transmission models featuring our latest product enhancements and fuel efficiency technology

performance including adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow i will wrap up the prepared comments with the fullyear  guidance update prior to qa please turn to slide five of the presentation for the q  performance summary sales decreased  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand in the global offhighway end market partially offset by higher demand in the north america onhighway end market and price increases on certain products gross margin for the quarter was  an increase of  basis points from a gross margin of  for the same period in  principally driven by price increases on certain products and favorable material costs adjusted net income decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by decreased sales volume and unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by price increases on certain products favorable material costs lower incentive and stockbased compensation expense reduced global commercial spending activities and decreased cash interest expense please turn to slide six of the presentation for the q  sales performance summary north america onhighway end market net sales were up  from the same period in  principally driven by higher demand for highway series models north america hybridpropulsion systems for transit bus end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand due to engine emissions improvements and nonhybrid alternatives that generally require a fullyautomatic transmission north america offhighway end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand from hydraulic fracturing applications defense end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by reductions in the us defense spending to longer term averages experienced during periods without active conflicts outside north america onhighway end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand in china partially offset by higher demand in europe outside north america offhighway end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand in the energy sector service parts support equipment and other end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand for north america service parts now i will turn the call back over to dave graziosi david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer thank you larry please turn to slide seven of the presentation for the q  financial performance summary given larrys comments i will focus on other income statement line items and adjusted ebitda selling general and administrative expenses decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by lower incentive and stockbased compensation expense and reduced global commercial spending activities partially offset by  million of unfavorable product warranty adjustments largely attributed to specific field action programs engineering research and development expenses decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense during the third quarter of  the environmental protection agency determined that general motors environmental remediation activities at our indianapolis indiana manufacturing facilities pursuant to the  asset purchase agreement were complete resulting in allison assuming responsibility for future operating monitoring and maintenance activities given the epas finding we recorded a pretax charge of  million for the environmental remediation future activities liability in our third quarter  results interest expense net increased  million from the same period in  principally driven by  million of unfavorable marktomarket adjustments for our interestrate derivatives partially offset by debt repayments and refinancing and the august  expiration of certain libor swaps cash interest expense decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by the august  expiration of certain libor swaps and debt repayments and refinancing income tax expense for the third quarter of  was  million resulting in an effective tax rate of  versus an effective tax rate of  for the same period in  the decrease in the effective rate is principally driven by the change in discrete activity diluted earnings per share for the quarter was  excluding the aftertax impact of the environmental remediation charge marktomarket adjustments for our interest rate derivatives reduced diluted earnings per share for the quarter by  adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million or  of net sales compared to  million or  of net sales for the same period in  the decrease in adjusted ebitda was principally driven by decreased sales volume and unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by price increases on certain products favorable material cost lower incentive compensation expense and reduced global commercial spending activities please turn to slide eight of the presentation for the q  cash flow performance summary net cash provided by operating activities decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by decreased sales volume partially offset by price increases on certain products favorable material costs reduced global commercial spending activities decreased cash interest expense and reduced excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation adjusted free cash flow decreased  million from the same period in  principally driven by decreased net cash provided by operating activities and reduced excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation during the third quarter allison continued its prudent and welldefined approach to capital allocation by settling  million of share repurchases paying a dividend of  per share and repaying  million of debt our share repurchases for the ninemonth period ended september   were approximately  million shares or  of the issued and outstanding shares as of december   we ended the quarter with net leverage of   million of cash and  million of revolver availability now ill turn the call back over to larry dewey lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks dave please turn to slide nine of the presentation for the fullyear  guidance update we anticipate no meaningful relief from the global offhighway end market challenges in the fourth quarter and are affirming our fullyear guidance ranges specifically a net sales decrease of  to  yearoveryear and adjusted ebitda margin of  to  adjusted free cash flow of  million to  million capital expenditures of  million to  million and cash income taxes of  million to  million although we are not providing specific fourth quarter  guidance allison does expect fourth quarter net sales to be lower than the same period in  the anticipated yearoveryear decrease in fourth quarter net sales is expected to occur due to lower demand in the global offhighway and defense end markets this concludes our prepared remarks melissa please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you to allow for as many questions as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question before passing the floor our first question comes from the line of david leiker with robert w baird please proceed with your question david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker good morning everyone lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning dave david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker if we look at the actions that youve taken here in the quarter on the cost side and maybe its better to look across the whole year but are there some metrics you can give us in terms of where you are in capacity utilization or change in head count or temporary versus fulltime workers or anything along those lines lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer sure we anticipated a fairly choppy horizon so what we did when we saw some of the positive numbers rolling in we opted not to do a lot of hiring frankly some of our factories while we are operating on a little more than one shift we added saturdays in where demand look like it was increasing a little bit so that we didnt create a cost overhang and as weve seen a little bit of the orders stabilizing and that continuing to increase we werent in a position where we had to do significant reductions we just rolled the over time out of the schedule david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great ill adhere to the one question rule thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs please proceed with your question lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jerry operator mr revich perhaps your line is on mute lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer jerry operator im sorry about that our next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse please proceed with your question jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi good morning lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer hey jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker can you just talk about how youre thinking about over the next  months your outlook on the defense business in particular jltv got awarded which i guess would impact you longer term but then there is also talk of international matv awards that its supposed to get awarded probably by the end of the calendar year so just wondering how youre thinking about that and the potential upside to you guys thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer sure well you are correct to note that there is a number programs that are being discussed out there weve got – the ones that oshkosh announced for the fmtv plusup and the foreign or nonus matv sales that they announced in q and q weve got those rolled in obviously we continue to work closely with our defense oems wheeled oems as well as some of the folks on some track programs as those are secured we roll those in immediately to the forecast obviously some of the others are a bit more speculative at this point we think were wellpositioned relative to the forecast we will be coming out in early  with our fourth quarter  call to give a specific view as to what we see in that space for  but clearly we are coming off a relatively low base with the us army and adding to it with some of these nonus orders jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker but i know you talked about the fmtv and then the international matvs that theyve talked about so far but i guess there is the view that there is an opportunity for a significant amount more of international matvs is that something that you think we should think about as we think about modeling for  or do you still think thats sort of – the timing would still be uncertain with that lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer well certainly you have a probability on any given one of those i would say as youve seen in our numbers todate with some of the geopolitical developments there has been an increase in defense procurements particularly in the wheeled space you see that in our europe numbers some of the middle east numbers as well and so – even a little bit in asia but mostly in europe and middle east and so we would expect that kind of backdrop to continue i guess is the way id say and id probably look at all the programs and handicap them a bit and then come up with an expected value thats kind of how we think about it jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker all righty thanks ill get back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs please proceed with your question jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co hi good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jerry i thought i was going to have to do like a mind meld there for a second jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co sorry about that im wondering if you could just talk about market share developments over the course of the quarter as you see it on the order book obviously ford has had no impact on your business doesnt look like there has been any impact on the eaton side and i know youve been focused on conquest customers as well can you just give us an update on those three areas and what the order book tells you about what the market share outlook is over the next couple of quarters lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer sure the areas that probably look like the brightest spots here in north america are the class  truck where if you look at the industry numbers versus our numbers – you always got to be a little colorful to make sure you are looking at production versus sales because of course we are tied into the production but if you take a look at that we feel good about some of the gains we made if you look at the industry data versus our data it would appear that our numbers are higher than the industry and the same thing is true for class  straight truck and even in the metro although were coming off a pretty low base there were able to pick some up so if you take a look like i said the way id run that number is id run the industry and then run our data and i think what youll see is our numbers are above the industry have been through  and even  so weve – obviously act publishes the data finalizes the actuals a little bit after the time period but we would expect to see some gains in those spaces in particular jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co and the order book tells you thats going to continue over the next couple of quarters lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer well the order books as you know are moving around a bit weve got some folks that are adding line rates but we do have some other folks that are putting in a little more downtime im sure you guys look across the industry and see that as well so those are moving around a bit but within those movements we would see those trends continuing jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co okay thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nicole deblase with morgan stanley please proceed with your question nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc yeah good morning guys lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc so my question is around north america offhighway business we have to get to that one obviously can you just comment a bit on what you are hearing from energy customers in north america and i guess my specific question is do you think that the quarterly run rate of north america offhighway revenue has bottomed or could there be further sequential downside in the fourth quarter lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer from where we sit looking at the fourth quarter its fundamentally – youre at a pretty low base in q wed see just a teench of a down i mean were essentially at the bottom and the issue is when is it going to turn and as it stands right now and youre looking at a lot of the data we are looking at were certainly not going to get out ahead of ourselves we think that the current dynamics are such that the offhighway is in a position the energy that im speaking of specifically thats probably going to be in place for a while and so we would expect that we will bump along where we are at and then what we are working on in our forward forecast that well be updating like i say next quarter call would be when do we think the turn is going to occur and there is a lot of opinions on that we tend to be – we tend to like to see it before we call it so you can count on us to be – to make sure again that we dont get out ahead of ourselves on that nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats really helpful thanks i will pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert wertheimer with barclays please proceed with your question robert wertheimer  barclays capital inc yeah hi good morning everybody lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning robert wertheimer  barclays capital inc so i guess mediumduty order has been a little bit mixed but pretty good class  vocational straight has been a little bit softer and at least in our view both of those fleets are relatively old and so the setup should be okay im wondering given the detail you can see into it what is the issue with class  straight is it just that order boards were full and people didnt want to order is it mostly canada is it mostly oil or maybe you can give us some sort of help there lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer well there is certainly a fair amount of support vehicles that go into supporting the offhighway that would be classified under straight truck class  if you take a look the interesting thing is if you take a look at the act data for the north america class  straight truck inventory and retail sales ratio its been bumping along within the kind of the threemonth to fourmonth range its actually – its in the higher end of the range but it has been a little higher historically depending on which month youve got to be careful because some of the months jump the data around but it is above the average there so we see some people taking some of the inventory down we do expect depending on the oem some activity there is going to be the construction pickup year starting in the fourth quarter into the first quarter some of the municipalities if theyre operating on a calendar year budget and if they have not spent their money its kind of spend it or lose it so we are watching that pretty closely as well but we think the overall assessment that youve noted relative to the age of the fleets in many cases is correct the issue is how is that going to play out specifically in terms of timing robert wertheimer  barclays capital inc okay great i will circle back again thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ian zaffino with oppenheimer please proceed with your question ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi thank you just a quick question on the use of cash flow is that going to go now all towards buybacks or how do you think about some of your debt maturities and the balance sheet david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer sure you look at the debt maturities the only charge that we have coming up is august of  which is the term loan b its about  million outstanding so as weve discussed the capital allocation model in our policy is well execute against the  million authorization that we have we talked about the progress todate here roughly  million executed continue to use the mediumterm net leverage target of  times to  times and then of course the  per share per quarter dividend so we continue to move consistent with that policy and allocation and obviously would – as larry said as we get to the fourth quarter results call and provide  guidance well provide an update at that point if there are to be any changes but i would certainly describe our position on the share repurchases as continuing to be opportunistic ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay perfect thank you very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jpmorgan please proceed with your question ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc yeah hi good morning lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc can you just give us a little bit more color on the warranty costs or the warranty issues that you talked about in the quarter david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer sure on – with our – one of our mediumduty products weve got a situation where weve identified the possibility of some issues tied back to some torque converter backing plate bolts – bolt issues and so weve taken a very aggressive posture consistent with the allison brand promise to go get those units before customers could or would have an issue weve got a pretty wide net that weve cast relative to making sure that we get everyone of those so that we dont take the chance of them having unscheduled downtime so its – were taking a very aggressive posture to again support the customers so that they dont have unscheduled downtime unnecessarily ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc and so that was mostly a q cost and a q event or will that spill into q and  david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer no no we operate when we identify the issue we accrue the full amount that we anticipate for the expense ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just circling back to an earlier question on your market shares you did a wonderful job of not telling us your market shares could you give us your market shares specifically and i know its market share of production thats fine but on class  and class  straight what is your market share yeartodate david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer again we wait for the final numbers to nail that down but you are probably right in the say   on class  truck and were north of the  on the class  straight ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you i will get back in line david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of larry demaria with william blair please proceed with your question larry t de maria  william blair  co llc hi thanks good morning you guys recently got a new order for the tc can you maybe put the importance of that in perspective does that move the needle and then secondly are we getting any closer to getting more oems signed up for the tc just curious about the adoption and if you could put it all in perspective for us thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer sure well mvt the very large order that they recently placed is a repeat order they are a – i think considered a leading fleet relative to fuel efficiency and so thats a significant endorsement they had a relatively significant – i think it was about  units initially and then of course with the recent announcements they made a very very significant purchase there its important to note that weve got a number of repeat orders including another one that will probably be getting announced here pretty soon not quite as large as the mvt order but certainly very significant weve had  different fleets purchased the tc typically in small quantities as they test it having said that  of those have already placed repeat orders as you may have also noted navistar as i mentioned in my remarks will be releasing the tc behind the cummins isx liter engine and we are certainly actively engaged with other oems and are hopeful – i guess optimistic that we will have more developments to announce here as we go forward larry t de maria  william blair  co llc thanks just curious i mean the issue to be the history of fuel economy savings or is it the residual value lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer well residual value is yet to be proven out we are confident that its going to carry the same kind of residual value benefits that the allison has typically had but with absent a multiyear experience we certainly arent getting that credit yet at this point in time it really becomes a question of productivity and the fuel efficiency of the products larry t de maria  william blair  co llc got it thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yes youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ross gilardi with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch good morning thank you larry t de maria  william blair  co llc good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch just a question on pricing i mean youve got some pricing this year at the same time the costs are going down and clearly youve seen some nice margin expansion on that just wondering do you feel like the price gains that youve achieved in  are sustainable for  and then whats the outlook for additional price increases next year particularly given the downdraft in costs and sort of mix demand environment david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer well the – well have some additional price in the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis as we enter  we would expect some additional activity on that front as weve said many times we continue to invest in the product and frankly the value that is delivering to end users so that will be a – has been and continues to be a focus for our team at the same time were going to drive forward our growth initiatives outside of north america in a number of areas as well as continue to support despite the challenging market conditions some of our new products including the higher horsepower frac transmissions that larry mentioned so all of that is in the mix as weve said margin improvement relative to the total view here we will invest some of that again and growth initiatives outside of north america of course and then look to making some continued improvements in our supply chain side as well on the labor side larry mentioned the fact that we continue to manage output through largely overtime in the onhighway plants where we continue to use that process given the broader market conditions that we face ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch thanks dave and then just looking for a little more color on the revenue improvement that you saw in the service and parts business whats behind that does that feel sustainable david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yeah we certainly did experience i would say a bit better volume in a few areas i would say overall some of that being tied to interestingly enough the offhighway business in north america having said that to some of the earlier questions and larrys response we dont necessarily see that continuing into fourth quarter so as is usual with us we take a relatively prudent approach to things market conditions i think itd be hardpressed to argue the alternative at this point if there is demand there we certainly stand ready to fulfill it at the same time realistically given the amount of idled equipment that is out there we are not expecting again a repeat performance in the fourth quarter one of the things we are paying a fair amount of attention to broadly is inventory levels throughout the channel both new units at oems as well as distributors our posture typically going into the end of the year when market conditions look to be i would say a bit more volatile is to manage our inventories down and thats a process that were underway with at this point so again well see how things go obviously by the end of the quarter and make the appropriate adjustments as we enter  ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vishal shah with deutsche bank please proceed with your question chad dillard  deutsche bank securities inc hi this is chad dillard on for vishal just wanted to go back to your comments about material costs can you just talk about the magnitude of the benefit that youre seeing and just how to think about when you see these benefits being anniversaried as we move into  lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer theres a number of initiatives that the team continues to work on i would say in some cases were probably at the beginning of that process versus the end having said that were also focused on supply chain sustainability and resourcing to what i would consider to be longerterm positions in negotiating our contracts to reflect that so this is not a view that we are going to have shortterm arrangements that dominate our supply chain frankly we take a longerterm view and were working against that at the same time making investments in value engineering and costing on our components and making investments in tooling et cetera we expect to achieve some level of return for that and that will be included in the run rates that well review with the first quarter guide for  but were certainly comfortable from where were positioned right now in terms of the initiatives that were pursuing chad dillard  deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then just for the international onhighway your fullyear outlook at least last quarter was flat has there been any change to that and then if not that would imply a rebound in the fourth quarter so could you just talk about the moving parts behind that david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yeah we have not changed the outlook there as larry said if you look at broader market conditions and im sure you are aware asia continues to be more volatile than wed like to see it having said that weve also talked about the fact that europe has been stronger both on the commercial side as well is some of the wheeled military activity there i think that netnet has really positioned us to have the overall flat guide if you well in terms of no change from the call we did back in july so something were paying a lot of attention to obviously entering  if they are going to be any potential improvements i would say our broader view right now is the emerging markets will continue to be tough sledding here for some period chad dillard  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you i will hop back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neil frohnapple with longbow research please proceed with your question neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc hi good morning guys lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc in the event that overall class  truck in north america is down significantly more than expected in  do you guys still believe that mediumduty truck can decouple and still experience modest growth over the next few years lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer i think the short answer to that is yes obviously there is some overlap as you correctly pointed out there are fleets that run across both of those categories class  and also class  but you do see a fair amount of bifurcation in the market there so the dynamics associated with each as weve seen i think are somewhat different neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc and then as a followup i mean the municipality are you guys continuing to see increased activity there and the outlook still seems bright lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean i think any recoveries we would note has been as we have projected going back a couple of years certainly has not been as extreme as significant as maybe past recoveries but there still seems to be some good solid business and momentum there in municipalities neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc thank you ill pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joe odea with vertical research partners please proceed with your question joe j odea  vertical research partners llc hi good morning in north america onhighway when you talked about inventory levels in key segments being maybe just slightly above average but maybe better than some of the other segments within class  but as you look at build over the last several months in excess of where order trends have been and a tough comp on strong q orders last year what is the risk of seeing some downward adjustments in build rates it doesnt appear that anything like that is contemplated in the guidance but as you monitor those conditions do you see the risk of any adjustments within the quarter just given the build in excess of orders recently lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer well theres a couple of things number one first off there are a lot of folks moving around build rates schedule days scheduled timeoffs so we have tried to contemplate that in our fourth quarter assessments i think in the prepared remarks we noted that we anticipated yearoveryear sales to be down in q and i think that captures some of the trends that you correctly pointed out i mean if you look at class  truck inventory to retail sales ratio based on the act data you had a low point in december  outside the system if you will between the  months to  months that act typically talks about is normal and if you look at the data points since theres been a gradual trend up and we are starting to see people react to some of that they were obviously anticipating a little different market dynamics and so weve got to the extent that were able to ferret that out with the oems weve got that built into some of our numbers and in a number of cases we anticipate oems having to take some volume out based on specific dealer data that we gather so we dont just take the oems forecast to us  we adjust it either upward or downward based on other data that we try to get from the market anecdotal data joe j odea  vertical research partners llc got it thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tim thein with citigroup please proceed with your question timothy w thein  citigroup global markets inc broker great thank you good morning just wanted to come back dave to your comments earlier in terms of outlook for pricing and kind of the value you bring im curious if youre closer to quantifying what the potential benefits from fuelsense could be as it relates to that and just more broadly obviously diesel at  per gallon compared to year plus is north of  is there any – im just curious in terms of the overall acceptance or enthusiasm towards that product from your customers in light of the different fuel price background thank you david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer sure the fuelsense understand that theres a number of different technologies that are included in that package right so as you think about what weve done fuelsense has been in the market for a little over a year now from majority of our oems the experience there continues to build with customers the feedback has been favorable larry mentioned some of the things we have done specifically in transit with some new models there the experience has been i think very favorable for them if you look at saving  to  in many cases plus which is pretty significant when you think about not changing the space claim of the product or anything that the end user really has to do so that continues to be the focus for us on a number of different technology implementations fuelsense broadly we continue to roll out in that fashion we would look to make some – i would say that the more complete version of that available here going into  versus  although we will build upon some of the releases weve already done but i think the reality is that the valuation if you will will be largely determined by end users experience and we will of course price accordingly so its early days but i would say the initial returns are certainly we believe very positive from the experience that end users have had including frankly the tc experience in terms of that product so broadly thats a focus for us i think fuel although its low in terms of commodity price right now the reality is if you have a longterm view that it returns to some – relevels at some point here our feeling is fleets are not viewing fuel as being cheap for the duration it will continue to gain i think traction there and more importantly the reduction in emissions et cetera i think broadly is a positive no matter what fleet is using our products lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah this is larry just tagging on a little bit there we talk about the fuelsense as the umbrella as dave has articulated weve used kind of a varied approach to how were currently monetizing it certainly the xfe models that i referenced were capturing price there the neutral at stop feature were capturing some price some of the pure calibration activities of fuelsense  as we call it internally here were pushing that into the market without price at the current time because we do want the experience as kind of – you can think about that like the free samples if you will and people are starting to – more and more oems are starting to release that and the end users starting to see the benefit for fuelsense  and thats what dave was talking about in  there will be the next stepup in terms of the benefits that that level of software and calibrations will bring and its at that point in time that well evaluate the ability to capture incremental price and would anticipate doing it at that time given peoples experience with fuelsense  and the added benefits of fuelsense  timothy w thein  citigroup global markets inc broker got it thanks a lot lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer welcome operator our next question comes from the line of ted grace with susquehanna please proceed with your question ted grace  susquehanna financial group lllp good morning gentlemen lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning ted grace  susquehanna financial group lllp i dont know if this a question for dave or larry but when you go through a scenario analysis could you just walk through how investors should think about kind of a trough ebitda or ebitda margin scenario if we look at  obviously there are a lot of puts and takes but youve got favorable price costs youve got benefits on incentive comp youre going to do ebitda its either the second or third best in the companys history so i know you havent given  guidance im not asking for that but when youre helping people get their arms around how to think about a downside scenario whether that is  or  could you just walk through how you would encourage people to think about that analysis david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer sure i mean in terms of downside scenario as we said well provide  guidance on the fourth quarter call early next year when you think about downside the last downside if you will for us certainly was the  downturn number of things have changed in the market if you look at our largest end market being north america onhighway its difficult for us to frankly contemplate anywhere near that type of market result frankly the fleet size age et cetera and all the variables that you are familiar with really make that i think an outlier relative to anything that we think about from a planning perspective having said that if you look at the balance of the end market certainly outside north america onhighway continues to be a growth opportunity for us having said that emerging markets are having their challenges but broadly speaking weve seen some softness there thats reflecting in our numbers already defense we have talked about we would certainly expect over the next year or two that market really bottoming if you will from a demand standpoint for a number of reasons if you look at the balance of our end markets certainly aftermarket parts et cetera thats going to have a strong tiein to the energy side ultimately when you think about where that market returns to and ultimately stabilizes at from a longerterm run rate perspective so we are certainly not in a position on the call to be providing detail downside scenarios but i would say within the end markets and the cost structure that we have in place to larrys earlier comments whether its hourly staffing or even the salaried side and the number of initiatives we have we have certainly maintained a fair bit of flexibility to adjust our cost structure to market conditions so we stand ready to make those adjustments if theyre required at the same time have continued to invest heavily in growth opportunities and technology implementation so we feel very good about the positioning of the product portfolio and well get after those opportunities that the market provides but again stand ready to make adjustments from a cost perspective as theyre required lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah this is larry i would just tag on a little bit and say that certainly we feel a lot better about where we stand in the material space some of the work that mike dick teresa van niekerk had done in the purchasing space looking out to the longer term contracts that contain the appropriate economics and what they have done in that space certainly as a result of the previous downturn weve got a number of structural differences from where we sat going into that so we feel a little better about that and weve got – were finalizing the last of the longterm supply agreements so weve got the economics with our customers our oem customers pretty well established on positive terms so there is a number of things that we have in place at this point in time that position us better now obviously if something significant changes we anticipate and respond to it but certainly feel in a very solid position at this point ted grace  susquehanna financial group lllp great and then if i could just – i think at this point im probably one of the last could you just bridge us on the q sga changes i know you mentioned lower incentive comp and stock comp and the benefit of lower marketing expense offset by the warranty but could you give us a specific bridge by category kind of how you get to the yearonyear change in sga david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer sure if you go through it yearoveryear third quarter incentive comp was about – and stockbased comp was about  million you had about  million going the other direction on the warranty adjustments and the balance is just commercial spending ted grace  susquehanna financial group lllp okay great thanks a lot good luck this quarter guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rhem wood with bbt capital markets please proceed with your question a rhem wood  bbt capital markets hey good morning lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning a rhem wood  bbt capital markets you guys i guess reiterated international onhighway guidance can you – are there any changes to the other end markets or are you reiterating those as well and then just one more on the environmental accrual that seemed like a q event it doesnt seem like an issue there but will any of that carry forward thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer lets start with the last part of it first we believe that we have made the appropriate accrual for the situation i described earlier we operate from the philosophy of if youve got to eat manure dont take small bites so we think weve got it all laid in there and dont intend to continue to make changes obviously well follow that program as we continue to execute the proactive steps that we are taking but we think weve got it captured in terms of outside north america if you look around youve got – lets just kind of go around the world quick like europe we are starting to see some positive signs certainly for our business in western europe some of the activities theyve done with natural gas as part of some of the oems work there has been real positive for us russia we were well positioned there but obviously with the geopolitical situation thats been a little choppy we do have some business in ukraine as well as some business with maz  one of the former cis if you will oems so that feels pretty solid weve got some activity in the middle east turkey also has been a plus asia youve got some challenges in china certainly on the bus side theyre doing some work in pure electric we are working to position ourselves for some of that i think theyre going to have some challenges operationally with that technology but okay theyre certainly making a run at purchasing some of that product truck side were continuing to track to plan feel good about that india weve had a nice stepup there both in the bus business as well as some of the work were doing in the military space and then also the truck space japan solid relative to some of the bus activity and some of the truck relative to some export programs the japanese oems have there as well as some inroads into the domestic market particularly rental and distribution korea has been a bright spot as weve gotten some of the releases in some of the small bus truck platforms there and then latin america its a relatively smaller part of our business mixed bag the guys have done a nice job of getting some releases with mercedes in some of the big markets but we are a significant presence in the likes of argentina and venezuela even brazil is having its challenges economically and so that becomes a bit of a mixed bag thats kind of a one step forward in terms of some of the releases and the opportunities and then one step back in terms of some of the underlying economic conditions so thats kind of a little bit of around the world for you david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer i would just add on in terms of the guidance and keeping it flat again there are very small changes amongst the seven end markets that we have but broadly the tone there is similar to what we talked about on the july call a rhem wood  bbt capital markets okay so youre not changing the guidance for the other end markets is what youre saying david s graziosi  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer correct correct a rhem wood  bbt capital markets okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex potter with piper jaffray please proceed with your question alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co broker hi guys just one very quick one here on pricing i think i heard this correctly but it sounds like so far none of the pricing that youre getting is the result of fuelsense and youre pushing most of that out into the future is that right lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer that is – on the calibration portion that is correct there are some other models whether its a neutral at stop feature or the xfe models we are getting price for those but the actual calibration portion of the fuelsense program  is going to the oems at this time at no charge alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co broker okay great thats what i thought and then i guess you touched on this a little bit with regard to the municipalities but school bus outlook what youre thinking there on that one specific i guess subsegment within the municipality market that would be helpful thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thats one that has been relatively stable it came down of course and we dont see a significant – we certainly dont see it rebounding to what you might consider a decadeold highs we think theres a number of factors that go into play the fact is people are holding onto them little longer school districts like some of the municipalities are working with their budgets and then the other piece of that is youre seeing a change both in the demographics of schoolchildren situation as well as the transportation they choose if youve been by a school youll see the school buses there and then youll see a line of about  cars lined up and that all equates to reduced demand for the school buses they still have to cover the same routes but theyre picking up fewer kids per stop and so – and the stops are spread out a little further so theyve got a little productivity they can add a little more distance on it because theyre making stops further apart so theyre able to get the route done so we think that where it sits now its going to be relatively stable youre going to see a few percent change here or there but not anything that gets us back up to i think the peak i saw in some data was  units we dont anticipate seeing that alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co broker okay very interesting thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question is a followup from the line of david leiker with robert w baird please proceed with your question david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker hey hello again i just wanted to sneak in here with one more thought can you run through where you are on new technology investments youve got a handful of things going on i dont think weve talked about it in a bit but just what youre seeing there and what the outlook looks like for them lawrence e dewey  chairman president  chief executive officer sure theres a number of things we are working on in the offhighway space we continue to look at the horsepower capability and continue to add to that on the highend we think that there are certain dynamics in certain parts of the world that are going to drive towards higher horsepower fewer rigs more horsepower per rig such that you can bring the same amount of horsepower to the well the pad with the multi well kind of scenario lends itself to that also so we continue with that product development activity in the offhighway space in the onhighway space in addition to some of the fuelsense work were doing some of the hybrid and electrification work that were doing where were taking existing – the work were doing involves our  series platform where we think – subject to battery capability and thats always the big issue with electric vehicles but subject to that we think weve got a concept that may have some interest to customers and we are continuing to work on that development then of course the fallbrook and the torotrak continuing to work the three legged stool challenges there with both of those technologies for idt cdt kind of application as main transmission products the three legs being performance that is primarily fuel efficiency although there are some other features that are enabled some capabilities that are enabled by those technologies but fuel efficiency durability and packaging and we continue to try to bring all three of those into a workable solution for oems and end users and that work continues today david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that is the end of our questionandanswer session id like to turn the floor back to mr larry dewey for any final remarks lawrence e dewey  chairman president

capital structure and allocation please turn to slide five of the presentation for the q  performance summary net sales decreased  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand in the global offhighway and service parts support equipment  other end markets gross margin for the quarter was  a decrease of  basis points from a gross margin of  for the same period in  principally

unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by favorable material costs and lower manufacturing expense please turn to slide six of the presentation for the q  sales performance summary north america onhighway end market net sales were down  from the same period in  principally driven by lower demand for rugged duty series models north america hybridpropulsion systems for transit bus

and unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by favorable material costs and lower manufacturing expense please turn to slide eight of the presentation for the q  cash flow performance summary net cash provided by operating activities increased  million from the same period in  principally driven by decreased operating working capital lower incentive compensation payouts

period in  principally driven by increased net cash provided by operating activities partially offset by increased capital expenditures and decreased excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation allison continued its prudent approach to capital structure and allocation during the first quarter by settling  million of share repurchases paying a dividend of  per share and repaying  million of debt we ended the quarter with a net leverage of   million of cash  million of revolver availability and  million of authorized share repurchasing capacity now ill turn the call back over to larry lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer please turn to slide nine of the presentation for the full year  guidance update we anticipate no meaningful release from the global offhighway end market challenges and are affirming our full year guidance ranges released to the market on february  net sales decrease of  to  yearoveryear an adjusted ebitda margin of  to  an adjusted free cash flow of  million to  million capital expenditures of  million to  million and cash income taxes of  million to  million although we are not providing specific second quarter  guidance allison does expect second quarter net sales to be down yearoveryear and up sequentially this concludes our prepared remarks melissa please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from the line of ross gilardi with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch yeah good morning thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch larry can you just talk a little bit more about the recent board changes and what they mean for the company i mean youve got some more outsiders on the board right now is there a push for management to pursue any new strategies a different capital allocation approach that would be a notable change from what the company is already doing lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer in march in fact on the th we announced the additional changes that youre referring to and really those continue our efforts that weve made over the past couple of years to refresh transform and strengthen the composition of the board as the sponsors have sold down their investments and as you noted we added some significant industrial operational expertise in asian business acumen by expanding the board we added two seats and we appointed stan askren and richard lavin as directors and then of course on this years ballot weve also provided our shareholders the opportunity to vote on a candidate who provides additional shareholder representation by nominating jamie star of longview asset management to fill the vacancy created by greg ledfords retirement then we also announced some changes to adopt bestinclass corporate governance practices we amended our bylaws to immediately implement a majority voting standard in a noncontested director election also provide proxy access to qualified shareholders at the  annual meeting and then we submitted a charter amendment to our stockholders that if approved well implement the annual election of our directors starting at our annual meeting next year so well end up with a board made up of  directors  of whom are independent and six of that  whove joined the board in the past two years including greg spivy of valueact and of course as i previously mentioned assuming he is elected jamie star of longview asset management so its really part of the transition of the board there we continue as you might imagine to have dialogue over capital allocation i would say at this point in time if we had made changes we would announce those but we continue to march and continue to looking and see what is the most prudent course of action relative to capital allocation again from an operating standpoint as weve said on a number of occasions our task is to drive the results and then put that in front of the board and then the board can decide on behalf of all stockholders whats the best use of the capital that we are generating ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch thanks very much lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs please proceed with your question jerry revich  goldman sachs  co good morning everyone lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning david s graziosi  president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning jerry revich  goldman sachs  co dave can you talk about the ebitda bridge in the quarter what was the headwind from the warranty charge that you took in the first quarter of this year and whats the outlook for warranties from here and can you talk about if pricing was a benefit to margins on a yearoveryear basis thanks david s graziosi  president chief financial officer  treasurer sure the warranty adjustments again talking ebitda bridge so it excludes the dpim charges and credits that we mentioned here on the call as you know in prior quarters and our results we typically look at our warranty accruals on a quarterly basis thats based on extensive product experience used in the field et cetera so i would not describe anything in the quarter as unusual our normal cadence is to make adjustments whether those are up or down unfortunately in the first quarter there were a number of situations where as we updated our experience we recorded some additional provisions i would say overall for the year our expectations have not changed significantly relative to warranty on the price side as we talked about on the fourth quarter call for full year we are in the range of  million to  million for total price yearoveryear first quarter frankly being the leanest of the four quarters relative to price just given the activity level that we had in the first quarter of last year as youll recall significant price appreciation last year and some of that was run rated frankly from  so again were not changing the guide relative to price for full year or warranty for that matter lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer jerry one thing ill add this is larry when we look at situations we feel very good about the quality improvements we have made for the adjustments that we made we did have a couple of situation spills as we call them that we had identified actually last year and as we continue to look at it we take a very aggressive approach to going after those on behalf of the customer and so as we looked at where we were at we said look we think that were going to need a little more in those funds to go after that and maintain the allison brand promise in the field and thats really where it comes from its not a fundamental change in the run rate its really directed towards very specific field action activities and we think weve got our arms around that but we are going after it very aggressively jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert wertheimer with barclays please proceed with your question robert wertheimer  barclays capital inc hi good morning everybody my question is on if you have a view on us inventories in straight truck inventories have come off a bit which is nice still at pretty elevated levels im not sure if we know what the right level is in a low interest rate environment how far down you think inventories might come and whether thatll be flushed out this year lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer well youre probably looking at the same charts im looking at right now relative to the class  class  truck inventory to retail sales ratio and the class  straight truck inventory those are a couple that we pay close attention to because they are a big part we have seen  you could argue that class  has moved around a fair amount but its within the range but its at the high range class  class  looks to be in a little better shape from the normal i think the low interest rates does make that situation a little less painful to folks and so you probably alter the fundamental equation of cost of inventory versus the loss sale perspective and so people are probably carrying a little more we would expect and we talked about this we talked that we thought early in the year that folks would be taking some actions to bring that down a little closer to the target point the center point of the range weve seen a few corrections in recent months but were not where we need to be now its end of april so i guess weve got a couple of months in the quarter and the half but i would say that we would expect that it probably would take a little longer than the first half for folks to bring that in line robert wertheimer  barclays capital inc thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse please proceed with your question jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi good morning i guess a questions one parts was down again meaningfully this quarter can you just talk about what youre seeing in the different divisions or the different segments and whether youre seeing any signs of bottoming maybe in sort of the offhighway markets and i know the rest of world onhighway markets were pretty good and then dave i guess my other question is as you sit here and you think about where we are in  and maybe its too premature to talk about  but based on your view of the business today do you think there are incremental costcutting opportunities that allison can undergo or do you feel like most of these markets are pretty bottomed out that we wont have to think about that as we approach  thanks david s graziosi  president chief financial officer  treasurer sure in terms of parts as we talked about here for first quarter really consistent with our thoughts around that onhighway a bit better offhighway continuing to be challenged its probably a nice way of putting that the reality is we think about just looking at the pieces for north america offhighway service we expect reasonably flat results q through q with q levels so as we look outside of north america again pretty flat across the quarters so overall as i said a bit softer than i believe we expected for full year at some level we continue to spend a fair bit of time addressing inventories in the channel and trying to figure out where those fit as we had talked about on the fourth quarter call there was the issue raised about hearing some things from the channel maybe a bit better than people were expecting the reality as we said at the time that was not really consistent with what were seeing and i think bluntly stated as we look at the balance of the year it continues to be extremely challenged so overall expectations are down significantly yearoveryear as we talked about on the fourth quarter call and again well keep an eye on things but it becomes very much a post world to focus on at this point in terms of aftermarket so well get to that as to your question in terms of  versus  we continue to keep a close eye on costs as we talked about on the fourth quarter call there is some cadence of that as we so called earn our way into the year and see how business conditions are presenting themselves and opportunities for that matter to allison so as we said earlier our thought process is were going to get after the opportunities that are meaningful and that are good investments but again were taking a very cautious view as the year rolls out here from a cost perspective and there is a number of things that we can do with levers in the business from a cost perspective weve done some of that already there are other opportunities there but frankly some of that is going to be tied to the volume cadence that we see we continue to constrain output through manning  and thats largely a variable process for us to look at on a very consistent basis beyond that we will scale spending to whatever the business conditions are presented to the business but overall we are not going to move away from our focus on strategic initiatives and more importantly some of the growth initiatives weve launched here more recently jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks ill get back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of larry de maria with william blair please proceed with your questions larry t de maria  william blair  co llc hi thanks good morning everybody lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning larry t de maria  william blair  co llc just a question on the ebitda margin cadence throughout the year obviously margin went down yearoveryear but still pretty solid and you noted sales will increase sequentially in the second quarter so when should we start to see these lower margins throughout the year to get you down towards the guidance level could you just give us some help on the cadence of margins throughout the year lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer sure as we typically see with the business there is some seasonality our sales in the first half are usually higher than the second half there are number of reasons for that we dont see this year playing out any differently from that perspective in terms of run rating as we talked about with the q expectations on sales we would look at that as probably one of the higher the highest quarter for the year at this stage certainly second half tailing off a bit as i said there is seasonality in there if you look at the margins they typically are going to follow for the most part volume so when you look at first halfsecond half we do have ebitda margins higher in the first half than the second half and historically i think as you know our q results typically are some of the lower ebitda margins because of the amount of down days holidays et cetera that are baked into the fourth quarter so again we dont expect that to be a different outcome for this year larry t de maria  william blair  co llc and if that was to change dramatically would it just simply be a result of volumes doing better or do you think it could be outside pressure on aftermarket if market stabilize and get a little bit better this year david s graziosi  president chief financial officer  treasurer the key story with aftermarket this year is really offhighway and as i said earlier id like to tell you that there is a better opportunity there in the nearterm but we tried to be as transparent as possible and i will tell you there is nothing that were aware of that would lead you to that conclusion at this point for  so we continue to have very low expectations for offhighway aftermarket this year larry t de maria  william blair  co llc got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc can you update us on the launch of tc i think i noticed yesterday that paccar is now offering the product in their lineup lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah as you know weve been released in navistar vehicles with the m engine in the last several months theyve announced and in fact are taking orders with the cummins isx as well as at navistar and then as you correctly noted here i think it was last thursday paccar announced the engineering program leading to a release in the kenworth t and t as well as the peterbilt  and peterbilt  with both paccar and cummins engines and so that engineering program has begun we are very actively engaged with them there would be validation in some work that needs to occur here and they accordingly havent announced the exact timing of the production release but the fact is were on route towards that end ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay appreciate that and just a quick follow up on the severe  service segment are you seeing any pickup in demand on the back of the highway bill or too early to tell or can you make the connection lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer the overall class  straight truck everyone is trying to get a handle on how far down thats going to be yearoveryear in terms of the total market size so we havent seen yet any appreciable difference there we did have within our planning some increase in shares we continue to drive programs like the paydirt program which is targeted towards construction we have seen good results from that this year so one of the things weve got to do as part of our back cast process is as we look at the shared numbers and thats really what were after when we do that of course the denominators what was the industry volume so we might gain some insights at that point in time as to any impact but we dont have that as we sit here today ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay i appreciate that thank you lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tim thein with citigroup please proceed with your question tim w thein  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks dave just to come back one more time on the aftermarket just in light of your caution on offhighway do you still feel that the down  for the full year is still an appropriate number to be thinking about david s graziosi  president chief financial officer  treasurer yeah i would say that there is some slight offset to what weve seen more recently in terms of the offhighway business but overall its in that range tim w thein  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got it and then larry maybe just talk a little bit about if youve gained any releases in the international markets that – obviously that number can bounce around a bit but maybe youre starting to get some traction in addition to a little better tone just in terms of what some of the european truck and bus makers are saying so maybe just a word on the international onhighway markets please lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer sure in terms of the releases as you know weve probably overfocused on some of that i mean its necessary but the release is not enough and we in the past have gotten a number of releases and what we really stepped back on as there needs to be certainly a focus on releases but really driving those releases through the oem into the end markets and i would say as far as releases weve certainly seen some of the positioning in china refuse some of the positioning in india truck europe a big change is the man when i was over there gosh a lot of years ago more than i care to count we were chasing man and the guys have finally broken through there so thats a big one both in europe as well as latin america in terms of releases i would say probably the volume drivers are more to focus on the end users europe there is some pickup and delivery activities some construction activity continued efforts there china small volumes but starting in the refuse space starting to see some of that same thing in latin america so probably one of the big ones is japan where we have had some breakthroughs in the rental market there rental vehicles cracked a couple of big accounts and thats generating in some market momentum which is driving some of their numbers so while we continue to focus of course on releases it really is step one of a threestep process secure the release promote the release through the oem and then sell the end user and were as part of our growth initiatives really putting a lot of attention to the second and third steps in that process tim w thein  citigroup global markets inc broker all right thanks a lot i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neil frohnapple with longbow research please proceed with your question neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc hi good morning congrats on a great quarter guys lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer hi good morning neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc i think you previously expected engineering expenses for  to be down in the  million range yearoveryear does the tc really surpass our changes  outlook at all and i guess just a brief followup would you guys still expect the sga to be flattish with  including a few of the one timers that occurred in the first quarter g frederick bohley  vice president finance hi neil this is fred on the engineering the expectation is still flattish throughout  with really no meaningful adjustment needed with the tc activities at paccar from an sga standpoint we would still expect consistent with what we talked about on the q call really if you look at sga i think if you exclude the stockholder activism expense from the first quarter its going to be pretty level with that point as you model out q through q neil a frohnapple  longbow research llc all right thanks for the help fred operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joe odea with vertical research partners please proceed with your question joe j odea  vertical research partners llc hi good morning it sounds like relative to the initial outlook that maybe the service side a little bit later but offset with some of the north america onhighway maybe just whether you can kind of confirm that and then within the north america onhighway it seemed like bus was particularly strong on the build front and is that related to the state budgets and spend picking up there was there something timing related that was beneficial in the quarter lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah as we look at the quarter i think you hit it right on the head weve seen a little bit of headwind in the parts driven by the offhighway certainly offhighway continues to be challenged the two positives north america onhighway is a large piece of the overall end market mix and then of course the performance in outside north america onhighways and those were kind of the pluses there as we look forward and the comment on the bus certainly we have seen and were speaking of school bus here we have seen some higher numbers there what were looking at very closely is the issue of timing versus an absolute level we are not seeing the data which would suggest the overall demand is going to be higher so then we are viewing it at this time as a timing issue now obviously well watch the out months and see how that schedule goes but all of the oems in that space are taking higher levels of schedules than what you would see normally on a seasonality basis visàvis an overall total forecast for the year so right now were looking at it as largely timing well certainly apprise folks if we think it results in a meaningful change to the overall volume for the year as we watch the out months schedules roll in joe j odea  vertical research partners llc okay thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex potter with piper jaffray please proceed with your question alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co broker hi guys thanks was wondering if you could comment a bit i guess on some competing technologies dual clutches amts and then also i recently started getting a little bit more noise from a couple oems regarding fully electric buses so id be interested in getting your commentary on whether you think any of those technologies have a leg to stand on whether theres any updated thoughts on any of that thanks lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer lets kind of take them in turn there relative to amts they certainly represent an improvement over a manual transmission although in medium duty they kind of penetrated to say call it low doubledigits and then theyve kind of receded back into low singledigits and thats been part of our share increase over the last couple of years where weve come out out of the highs back through what had been the previous high of lows into i think we estimate about  in  so weve been able to demonstrate the relative value there in the class  class  truck obviously the battleground now is in the class  tractor market where were coming in actually with our  highway series with some of the baby s as we call them smaller engines thats been a nice little pickup for us and then of course the tc coming into that space and one of the things that we continue to focus on is what is the value proposition relative to the fuel efficiency of the tc the customers have been very pleased with that weve had a number of fleets the number of fleets continues to increase as of early this month weve had almost  discrete customers  fleets where some of those customers have multiple fleets and about  of them have already reordered so were seeing a nice acceptance there and well continue to drive that process so thats the amt as far as the dct probably the thing that i could say that would be fair to acknowledge for them is the launch capability is a lot better than the amt so thats a plus having said that the dct does rely on a clutch to start the vehicle and so they limit the clutch engagement torque at start and launch to avoid burning the clutch and that results in a lower launch capability which then over a startstop cycle which is where its targeted and ends up with a differential in productivity that we think plays well for us well be coming forward with updated and validated testing relative to fuel economy and were pretty confident what thats going to show so weve gone to the market with that we have given the longstanding total cost of ownership and our knowledge of the duty cycles and the durability of the allison weve come out with a sevenyear coverage in the school bus space that we think will be very attractive in fact as we understand it a number of school districts are writing that into their specs and what we offer that for is frankly a fraction of what the dct supplier is offering it for so that just widens the value proposition we think that we have as far as the electric vehicles certainly there is a lot of excitement over that reminiscent of all the excitement for hybrids perhaps where you see it most significantly is in china whereby government fiat they are directing the purchase of what they call new energy vehicles most of which are electric that has negatively impacted some of the volumes that weve had there in transit bus on the one hand if in that context if the government says that the sun is going to rise at midnight you better be putting your sun tan lotion on at  so clearly there is a legislative or really not even legislative a directive to purchase that that is changing some of the subsidies have altered the economics of that proposition where a new energy vehicle or an electric bus costs significantly less than a conventional much less than hybrid so that was something which certainly encouraged the properties or supported the properties in meeting the direction from the central government thats changing those subsidies are going to go towards building infrastructure and so the incentive for the actual vehicle purchase is going to change that probably given the direction from the government isnt going to significantly alter the nearterm mix what we are seeing however as we somewhat expected frankly is that the vehicles themselves if you understand the limitations of battery technology at least as it exists today the vehicles themselves are not living up to in a number of cases the standards of performance that the customers had been used to in a conventional vehicle whether its the ability to handle the route or whether its the uptime as a result of some of the challenges of a fully electric vehicle so theres a number of issues that are yet to play out but clearly theres a lot of interest we have in fact ill be getting an update later this week on what we might do to position a variant of our product into that space the challenge becomes a lot of these are like science fair projects and you can dump a ton of money into what is a very very small volume of vehicles and so we want to do it smart we want to be there so that if some of the technical advancements are there particularly relative to battery technology that were positioned for but we also want to do it in a responsible manner so thats kind of how were thinking about some of the electric vehicles alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co broker thank you very much i appreciate all the color lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah operator thank you mr dewey there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks lawrence e dewey  chairman  chief executive officer well certainly we appreciate everyones time this morning and the support and interest that youve shown in allison and we look
