downright weird beauty topics weve covered everything from drying out pimples to the benefits of smearing snail mucus on ones face theres one strange phenomenon in the world of skincare and beauty that doesnt seem to get a lot of attention however and that is product pilling you might not have heard the name for this phenomenon before but if you use skin care products or wear makeup at all then youve probably experienced it at least once despite the fact that its a pretty common occurrence that most women have probably experienced it seems like nobody ever talks about it and yet if you describe the problem to a friend chances are they will exclaim oh my gosh thats happened to me too  so what is product pilling anyway and what can you do about it its basically like when a sweater pills except it happens to products on your skin the bad news is that its incredibly annoying — but the good news is that its not impossible to prevent two experts gave their insight on the phenomenon of product pilling dr norman rowe md a nycbased boardcertified plastic surgeon and dr jody comstock a leading dermatologist in tucson arizona  lets get to the bottom of this shall we  what is product pilling  you know how annoying it is when your favorite sweater starts pilling well its even more annoying when the same thing happens on your face according to dr rowe product pilling is the description of when a topical cream applied to the skin starts ballingup after it’s applied you may have noticed this happen immediately after applying makeup or skin care or perhaps a few hours later you touch or rub your face and feel the products on your skin rolling up into grimy balls  its pretty gross but dont worry youre not a monster theres a perfectly good reason why this happens to everyone and its not because your skin is dirtier or greasier than anyone elses   what causes product pilling  drunk elephant tlc framboos glycolic night serum  amazon  stridex maximum strength pads  amazon dr rowe said product balling has to do with ability of the product to be absorbed by the skin the less a product is absorbed the more it balls up along the same lines dr comstock said pilling is more common with thicker moisturizers so if youve been using a heavy moisturizer or foundation that feels like its just sitting on top of your skin then dont be surprised if that product starts pilling   another reason could simply be user error as dr rowe explained products can pill up because of incorrect application as well — too much product was used or the order of application of products try using a less heavyhanded approach to your makeup or skincare routine and if that doesnt work then try switching up the order in which you apply products if at all possible you could use process of elimination to determine which product is causing the pilling and then stop using it if you feel that product isnt worth it  one more thing that can cause product pilling is skipping an important skin care step one may need to exfoliate the skin prior for the product to penetrate into the skin dr rowe advised so consider adding a chemical exfoliant to your regular skincare routine if you dont already use one whether its a simple drugstore product such as stridex acne pads or a more sophisticated exfoliant such as drunk elephant tlc framboos™ glycolic night serum then give it a few minutes to be absorbed by your skin before moving on to the next product in your routine  why do some products tend to pill on your face while others don’t   pilling happens to me sometimes but not all the time this made me think that it had to be caused by specific products that i only used occasionally dr rowe confirmed that the ingredients in some products may make them more prone to pilling siliconebased products are not absorbed by the skin therefore if a product contains silicone it could ball up a lot of beauty products contain silicones so if youre experiencing a lot of product pilling on your face you may want to look at the ingredient lists of your favorite products and try nixing anything with silicones look for ingredients like dimethicone or basically any words that end in cone  other ingredients that could be causing pilling according to dr comstock are talc iron oxide mica and fluorphlogopite talc especially is often found in makeup dr comstock suggests using products containing these ingredients last to avoid pilling  also as dr rowe said previously you can consider getting rid of any products that arent being absorbed by your skin because theyre simply too heavy   what can be done to avoid product pilling  acure organics marula oil  amazon weleda almond sensitive skin facial oil  amazon drunk elephant virgin marula luxury facial oil  amazon other than not using products that contain silicones and applying products with a light hand there are other approaches that you can take to avoid having products pill on your skin dr rowe has a couple of suggestions first in order to avoid product pilling use products that are organically based and therefore easy for the skin to absorb this makes a lot of sense since organicallybased beauty products arent likely to include manmade silicones so if you were looking for a reason to switch to organic natural beauty products there you go  dr comstock advises putting products on in a certain order apply products in order of weight and viscosity so one should apply waterbased products first the texture is more fluid and oilbased products last to seal the skin so toners and serums go first and creamssunblocksmakeup go last as long as you put on lighter thinner products first and heavier oily products last you should be good  another helpful tip from dr rowe has to do with ingredients and the order of application also do not apply a product over an oilbased product as oilbased products decrease absorption and therefore balling so for example if you like to use a facial oil at night my favorites are pictured above be sure to pat it onto your skin last after youve already applied your other products  both dr rowe and dr comstock advise regular exfoliation as well as time in between each product application to help with pilling dr rowe said it’s important to remember to exfoliate the skin prior to use and make sure there is time in between application of products so the skin has time to recover if you layer a bunch of products on your skin without giving them time to be absorbed then it makes sense that everything is going to slide off your skin and into little balls of product  dr comstock also advised giving your skin time to absorb products pilling is often caused by not giving skin enough breathing room between layers give skin a little space for drying and being absorbed blow dry your hair put make up on brush your teeth drink your coffee between layers especially if the product is a little heavy she also recommends using a brush instead of fingers to apply makeup because the warmth of your fingers can also cause heavier products to pill  so remember to layer your products in the correct order take your time so they can all be absorbed use an exfoliant regularly and try to avoid heavy products or anything with silicones if you follow those guidelines then you should no longer have to worry about your products pilling on your face  images kelly
