william r johnson — biography  life is like a football game home business biographies fl william r johnson — biography william r johnson – ceo and president hj heinz company nationality american born  education university of california–los angeles ba  university of texas–austin mba  family son of bill tiger johnson a professional football player and coach and mothers name unknown married susie maiden name unknown c  children two career drackett company – assistant brand manager ralston purina  fritolay – andersonclayton foods – group product manager then vice president and director of marketing for consumer products heinz usa – general manager of new business then general manager of marketing and vice president of marketing – president and chief executive officer of heinz pet products then also supervisor of starkist foods hj heinz company – senior vice president and director – president and coo – ceo and president – chairman ceo and president address hj heinz company  grant street pittsburgh pennsylvania  httpwwwheinzcom ■ william r johnson was recruited to heinz usa in  and made a name for himself turning around heinzs poorly performing starkist and pet products divisions which some industry analysts had considered unsalvageable johnson was appointed president and chief executive officer of hj heinz company in  and was made chairman in  after taking over johnson focused on cost cutting and the performance of major brands to help turn heinz around as it had suffered from stiffer competition and pricing demands from wholesalers johnson was described by himself and coworkers alike as incredibly intense industry analysts noted that johnson was a fiscal conservative and dedicated cost cutter william r johnson apwide world photos  life is like a football game johnsons father bill tiger johnson was a center for the san francisco fortyniners professional football team and later the head coach of the cincinnati bengals according to johnson who grew up in palo alto california following his fathers career helped instill him with a fiercely competitive spirit and a passionate distaste for losing he credited his father as being a major influence on his life and continued to take advice from him throughout his career johnson said he also learned how to motivate people by examining the methods used by his father and other coaches in an interview with patricia sabatini for the pittsburgh postgazette  johnson noted some people need to be handled gently other people you can kick in the rear end may   after receiving his masters in business administration from the university of texas–austin in  johnson went to work briefly for ralston purina in st louis and then fritolay in dallas in  he joined clayton foods also in dallas and quickly impressed the companys ceo before long he was made vice president of marketing and of the consumer product group as the then ceo rick avery later recalled johnson was results oriented and every year he was with the company the bottom line went up establishing pricebased costing johnsons success at clayton foods caught the attention of the heinz company which began to recruit him avery said he fought off heinzs advances but knew he had lost the war when heinz sent a corporate jet to pick johnson and his wife up for a meeting johnson joined heinz usa in  as general manager of new business and was later appointed general manager of marketing in  johnson was made president of heinzs pet products division and four years later he took over one of the companys most visible divisions starkist foods as the head of these divisions johnson reached new heights successfully turning them around partly through a process he helped pioneer called pricebased costing the traditional formula of s business was the simple equation cost plus margin equals the price of the product in the new business era of the s with increased competition offering consumers more and more product choices johnson turned to the philosophy of determining what consumers were willing to spend and then doing whatever was necessary to be profitable at those prices this goal was primarily met by slashing costs in every possible realm of the business johnson described the concept as simple but noted that its execution could be painful johnsons strategy at pet products and starkist was a success as sales and profits soared so did johnsons renown within the company in  he was named to heinzs board and became a senior vice president responsible for heinzs burgeoning operations in asia pacific the experience would prove invaluable with respect to his eventual leadership of hj heinz in an interview for an alumni profile on the university of texas–austin web site johnson noted working overseas you have to learn to be flexible to adjudicate issues in local terminology march   he pointed out that each over seas market required a unique approach and marketing technique and that establishing a brand was often more important than seeking profits in the early stages named ceo in  johnson took over the position of ceo at heinz from the longtime and popular ceo and chairman anthony j f oreilly the first step johnson took as ceo was to announce several top management appointments as he installed his own senior administrative team unlike his predecessor who was surrounded by older top executives johnson was intent on recruiting and promoting a new generation of younger talented executives most in their s johnson also established that he would continue to be dedicated to cost cutting and to restructuring the company which he had begun the year before through heinzs project millennia he also announced that he would centralize decisionmaking at heinzs pittsburgh headquarters and increase headquarters role in tracking the performance of heinzs numerous international operations some analysts feared that johnson would be overeager in his costcutting wars with other large food companies the industry analyst nomi ghez also noted that johnson was changing the centralized structure of the company and told patty tascarella in an interview for the pittsburgh business times  that the risk is to hurt a culture of a company while youre achieving efficiencies december   nevertheless many analysts saw johnson as the right person for the job at the right time because his strength in operations would help the company better compete in a tougher industry environment faced many challenges when he took over the reins at heinz johnson was dealing with a muchchanged business environment in the processedfood industry for example heinz and most other foodproduct companies were facing increased competition from retail giants who were able to squeeze suppliers to keep costs down in addition low inflation was leaving little opportunity to raise prices and more and more consumers were eating out in a businessweek article johnson noted you can no longer price your way to prosperity december   in  johnson announced that heinz would consolidate its ketchup and condiment business into one advertising and brandimage account valued at  million the move was made to establish a consistent worldwide image for heinz ketchup that would be similar to images created by cocacola and mcdonalds johnson also set out to increase sales and cash flow while reducing company debt he simplified the companys distribution chain by closing warehouses outsourcing more work trimming inventories and disposing of slowmoving products johnsons strategy also included returning to basics by focusing on heinzs core lines including ketchup and condiments frozen foods and infant and nutritional products in the process johnson oversaw the selling of heinzs tuna and petfood businesses in a  billion deal with del monte foods johnson further restructured the company through programs such as the operation excel and streamline initiatives nevertheless johnson and heinz continued to struggle with the good news–bad news dilemma faced by many corporate food giants in march  the good news was that heinzs  core brands were doing well as evidenced by its us ketchup sales garnering a  percent share of the market and an overall sales increase of between  and  percent in its european and asian markets however heinz reported only modest performance overall with a net income of  million  cents per share down from the  million  cents per share of a year earlier in  heinzs stock was trading at approximately  a  percent decline from the previous year furthermore heinz had a total of  charges against earnings over the previous  quarters some analysts noted that johnsons seemingly endless restructuring programs had earned little profit for

johnson was recruited to heinz usa in  and made a name for himself turning around heinzs poorly performing starkist and pet products divisions which some industry analysts had considered unsalvageable johnson was appointed president and chief executive officer of hj heinz company in  and was made chairman in  after taking over johnson focused on cost cutting and the performance of major brands to help turn heinz around as it had suffered from stiffer competition and pricing demands from wholesalers johnson was described by himself and coworkers alike as incredibly intense industry analysts noted that johnson was a fiscal conservative and dedicated cost cutter william r johnson apwide world photos  life is like a football game johnsons father bill tiger johnson was a center for the san francisco fortyniners professional football team and later the head coach of the cincinnati bengals according to johnson who grew up in palo alto california following his fathers career helped instill him with a fiercely competitive spirit and a passionate distaste for losing he credited his father as being a major influence on his life and continued to take advice from him throughout his career johnson said he also learned how to motivate people by examining the methods used by his father and other coaches in an interview with patricia sabatini for the pittsburgh postgazette  johnson noted some people need to be handled gently other people you can kick in the rear end may   after receiving his masters in business administration from the university of texas–austin in  johnson went to work briefly for ralston purina in st louis and then fritolay in dallas in  he joined clayton foods also in dallas and quickly impressed the companys ceo before long he was made vice president of marketing and of the consumer product group as the then ceo rick avery later recalled johnson was results oriented and every year he was with the company the bottom line went up establishing pricebased costing johnsons success at clayton foods caught the attention of the heinz company which began to recruit him avery said he fought off heinzs advances but knew he had lost the war when heinz sent a corporate jet to pick johnson and his wife up for a meeting johnson joined heinz usa in  as general manager of new business and was later appointed general manager of marketing in  johnson was made president of heinzs pet products division and four years later he took over one of the companys most visible divisions starkist foods as the head of these divisions johnson reached new heights successfully turning them around partly through a process he helped pioneer called pricebased costing the traditional formula of s business was the simple equation cost plus margin equals the price of the product in the new business era of the s with increased competition offering consumers more and more product choices johnson turned to the philosophy of determining what consumers were willing to spend and then doing whatever was necessary to be profitable at those prices this goal was primarily met by slashing costs in every possible realm of the business johnson described the concept as simple but noted that its execution could be painful johnsons strategy at pet products and starkist was a success as sales and profits soared so did johnsons renown within the company in  he was named to heinzs board and became a senior vice president responsible for heinzs burgeoning operations in asia pacific the experience would prove invaluable with respect to his eventual leadership of hj heinz in an interview for an alumni profile on the university of texas–austin web site johnson noted working overseas you have to learn to be flexible to adjudicate issues in local terminology march   he pointed out that each over seas market required a unique approach and marketing technique and that establishing a brand was often more important than seeking profits in the early stages named ceo in  johnson took over the position of ceo at heinz from the longtime and popular ceo and chairman anthony j f oreilly the first step johnson took as ceo was to announce several top management appointments as he installed his own senior administrative team unlike his predecessor who was surrounded by older top executives johnson was intent on recruiting and promoting a new generation of younger talented executives most in their s johnson also established that he would continue to be dedicated to cost cutting and to restructuring the company which he had begun the year before through heinzs project millennia he also announced that he would centralize decisionmaking at heinzs pittsburgh headquarters and increase headquarters role in tracking the performance of heinzs numerous international operations some analysts feared that johnson would be overeager in his costcutting wars with other large food companies the industry analyst nomi ghez also noted that johnson was changing the centralized structure of the company and told patty tascarella in an interview for the pittsburgh business times  that the risk is to hurt a culture of a company while youre achieving efficiencies december   nevertheless many analysts saw johnson as the right person for the job at the right time because his strength in operations would help the company better compete in a tougher industry environment faced many challenges when he took over the reins at heinz johnson was dealing with a muchchanged business environment in the processedfood industry for example heinz and most other foodproduct companies were facing increased competition from retail giants who were able to squeeze suppliers to keep costs down in addition low inflation was leaving little opportunity to raise prices and more and more consumers were eating out in a businessweek article johnson noted you can no longer price your way to prosperity december   in  johnson announced that heinz would consolidate its ketchup and condiment business into one advertising and brandimage account valued at  million the move was made to establish a consistent worldwide image for heinz ketchup that would be similar to images created by cocacola and mcdonalds johnson also set out to increase sales and cash flow while reducing company debt he simplified the companys distribution chain by closing warehouses outsourcing more work trimming inventories and disposing of slowmoving products johnsons strategy also included returning to basics by focusing on heinzs core lines including ketchup and condiments frozen foods and infant and nutritional products in the process johnson oversaw the selling of heinzs tuna and petfood businesses in a  billion deal with del monte foods johnson further restructured the company through programs such as the operation excel and streamline initiatives nevertheless johnson and heinz continued to struggle with the good news–bad news dilemma faced by many corporate food giants in march  the good news was that heinzs  core brands were doing well as evidenced by its us ketchup sales garnering a  percent share of the market and an overall sales increase of between  and  percent in its european and asian markets however heinz reported only modest performance overall with a net income of  million  cents per share down from the  million  cents per share of a year earlier in  heinzs stock was trading at approximately  a  percent decline from the previous year furthermore heinz had a total of  charges against earnings over the previous  quarters some analysts noted that johnsons seemingly endless restructuring programs had earned little profit for shareholders others however were more optimistic of johnsons moves within the company the industry analyst william leach told david shock for a businessweek online article i think people dont realize that this company over many years had cobbled together a messy portfolio of businesses and the recent
