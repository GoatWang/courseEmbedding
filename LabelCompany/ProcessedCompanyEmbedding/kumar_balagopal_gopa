application ser no  filed sep   and us provisional patent application ser no  filed sep   the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties technical field the subject matter described herein relates to call jumping more particularly the subject matter described herein relates to methods systems and computer program products for flexible call jumping background with the emergence of ip application servers it has become desirable to use such servers to provide advanced features to telecommunications subscribers one feature that it may be desirable to provide is call jumping call jumping refers to the ability to transfer an inprogress call from one phone to another phone without dropping the call for example a subscriber who initiates a call from his or her office phone may desire to transfer the call to his or her mobile phone in order to continue to call when the subscriber leaves the office call jumping is currently available for inbound calls that is a subscriber who receives a call can elect to jump the call to another phone and continue to call from the other phone however it is believed that current networks do not allow call jumping from an outbound call that is the calling party does not currently have the capability to jump the call to a new destination another shortcoming of existing services is combining call jumping with other features such as remote phone remote phone is a feature that allows a subscriber to provision one phone such as the subscribers mobile phone to masquerade as another phone for example a subscriber may desire to have all calls directed to his or her office phone ring on the subscribers mobile phone outbound calls from the mobile phone will appear to called parties as if the calls are made from the subscribers office phone once the subscriber has the remote phone feature activated the subscriber may desire to implement inbound or outbound call jumping from the remote phone it is believed that current call jumping implementations do not provide this capability accordingly in light of these difficulties associated with existing call jumping solutions there exists a need for methods systems and computer program products for flexible call jumping summary the subject matter described herein includes methods systems and computer program products for flexible call jumping according to one aspect a method for implementing a call jump from an outbound call is provided the method includes receiving an indication from a calling phone for initiating a call with a called phone a call is established between the called and calling phone during the call an indication is received from the calling phone to jump the call to a users selected destination and in response to receiving the indication to jump the call the call is jumped from the calling phone to the destination so that the call continues between the destination and the called phone the subject matter described herein for flexible call jumping may be implemented using a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions embodied in a computer readable medium exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include chip memory devices disk memory devices programmable logic devices and application specific integrated circuits in addition a computer program product that implements the subject matter described herein may be implemented using a single device or computing platform or may be distributed across multiple devices or computing platforms

network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for flexible call jumping according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein referring to fig  a first phone  may seek to establish a call with a second phone  phones  and  may be any types of phones examples of phone types include pstn phones mobile phones ip phones or combinations thereof in the illustrated example phones  and  are assumed to be ip phones a voice over ip application server  may provide the functionality for flexible call jumping according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein voice over ip application server  may be implemented on a computing platform that performs signaling for jumping calls and that provides applications for providing features for different phones an exemplary hardware platform suitable for implementing voice over ip application server  is the t platform available from tekelec of morrisville nc an exemplary software architecture for voice over ip application server  will be described in detail below in the illustrated example a user of phone  may seek to establish a call with a user of phone  accordingly signaling may occur between phone  andor its associated end office and voice over ip application server  to establish the media connection similarly signaling may also occur between voice over ip application server  and phone  or its associated end office once the signaling is complete and the called party associated with phone  answers a media connection is established between phones  and  as indicated by arrow  in the diagram once a call is established between phones  and  the user of phone  may request a call jump to destination  in the illustrated example destination  corresponds to a phone  which is a mobile telephone once a jump is requested signaling occurs between voice over ip application server  and phones  and  to jump the call to the new destination once the signaling is complete a media connection is established between phone  and destination   as indicated by the arrow labeled  in the diagram fig  is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps that may be performed by voice over ip application server  to establish a call jump from an outbound call according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein referring to fig  in step  voice over ip application server  receives an indication from a calling phone for initiating a call with a called phone in step  voice over ip application server  establishes a call between the called and calling phones in block  during the call voice over ip application server  receives an indication from the calling phone to jump the call to a user selected destination in response to receiving the indication voice over ip application server  jumps the call to the destination such that the call can continue between the destination and the called phone figs a and b are a call flow diagram illustrating exemplary signaling messages exchanged between calling phone  voice over ip application server  a sip gateway  called phone  destination   and a second destination  for performing outbound call jumps according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein referring to fig a in line  calling phone  sends a sip invite message to voice over ip application server  to initiate a call with called phone  voice over ip application server  sends the invite message to sip gateway  which sends the corresponding ss message to an end office associated with called phone  in response to the call initiation request the called phone  rings in line  of the call flow diagram the called party answers and an answer message is communicated to sip gateway  sip gateway  sends a  ok message to voice over ip application server  which sends a description of the media capabilities of called phone  to calling phone  after line  a two way realtime transmission protocol rtp media stream is established between calling phone  and called phone  in line  of the call flow diagram calling phone  requests a call jump from the outbound call by dialing predetermined dtmf digits which in the illustrated example are “” in this example  indicates a call jump and  indicates a jump to destination  in line  of the call flow diagram voice over ip application server  initiates a call to destination   destination   rings in response to its end office receiving the corresponding signaling in line  of the call flow diagram the terminal at destination   is answered the terminal at destination  may be answered by the original calling party who requested that the call be jumped to destination  in line  signaling indicating that the destination terminal has been answered along with the media capabilities of the terminal associated with destination  is communicated to voice over ip application server  in line  of the call flow diagram voice over ip application server  plays a challenge to destination   the challenge may be a request that the calling party at destination   enter predetermined digits to complete the call jump requiring that the calling party enter dtmf digits to complete the jump reduces the likelihood that the call will be connected to a destination not desired by the calling party such as an answering machine in line  of the call flow diagram destination   accepts the challenge by communicating the predetermined digits to voice over ip application server  in lines ac of the call flow diagram voice over ip application server  idles the call to calling phone  and reinvites called phone  and destination   to jump the call after line c a two way audio stream exists between destination   and called phone  referring to fig b in line  of the call flow diagram destination   requests a second call jump to jump the call to destination   in line  of the call flow diagram voice over ip application server  signals destination  to establish a call between destination  and called phone  in line  of the call flow diagram the terminal at destination   is answered and voice over ip application server  is notified of the answer via a  ok message in lines ac of the call flow diagram voice over ip application server  idles the call to destination  and reinvites called phone  and destination   to the call after line c a two way audio stream exists between destination   and called phone  in line  of the message flow diagram the called party hangs up and in line  voice over ip application server  signals to disconnect the call from destination   thus using the signaling illustrated in figs a and b a call jump can be initiated from an outbound call in addition multiple call jumps can be performed for the same call fig  is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary software architecture of voice over ip application server  for implementing call jumps according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein referring to fig  voice over ip application server includes a plurality of components  that correspond to actual telecommunications network elements for example a gateway component  may perform gateway functionality such as conversion between sip and another form of signaling such as ss trunk component  may correspond to aspects of a physical trunk call component  may store attributes of a call in progress for example call component  may maintain call state information line component  may be implemented on a per subscriber basis and store attributes of a subscribers line phone component  may store information about a subscribers phone such as the phones media capabilities and contact information caller component  may store attributes about an incoming caller find me components  and  may implement find me service such as simultaneously or sequentially ringing phones of a subscriber voice over ip application server  also includes services feature logic  for implementing advanced features such as call jumping in the illustrated example services feature logic  includes a jump manager  for initiating call jumps from inbound andor outbound calls jump manager  may also initiate call jumps from remote phones as will be described in more detail below in operation when an incoming call arrives at phone component  the incoming call event is passed to line component  line component  presents the event to service feature logic  service feature logic  analyzes the event for dtmf or other codes indicating a call jump or other features in this example it is assumed that the requested feature is a call jump accordingly jump manager  creates a jump call and initiates signaling to jump the call to the new destination as stated above another aspect of the subject matter described herein includes performing a call jump from a remote phone as used herein the term “remote phone” refers to a phone that masquerades as another phone for example a user may desire to forward his or her office phone to a cell phone such that calls made from the cell phone will appear as though they were made from the users office phone similarly calls made to the users office phone may ring the users cell phone and the call may appear to the calling party as if it was made to the users office phone it may also be desirable for the user to perform call jumps from the remote phone in fig  call establishing calls to or from a remote phone may be performed by remote phone manager  fig  is a call flow diagram illustrating exemplary signaling for performing a call jump from a remote phone according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein in the example illustrated in fig  the calling phone is indicated by reference numeral  the called phone is indicated by reference numeral  and the remote phone is indicated by reference numeral  in the call flow in line  calling phone  invites called phone  to a call by sending an invite message to line component  of gateway  in line  of the call flow diagram line component  sends a connect message to calling phone  which is converted into a  ok message in line  of the call flow diagram line component  sends an initialization message to phone component  which sends an invite message to called phone  in line  once the called phone is answered a progress message is communicated to line component  in line  of call flow diagram line component  invites remote phone  to participate in the call in line  a progress message is communicated to line component  in line  when remote phone  is answered a connect message is communicated to line component  in line  remote phone  initiates a call jump by sending predetermined digits to line component  in line  line component  disconnects the call from sip phone  in line  sip phone  acknowledges the disconnection in line  line component  sends a connect message to remote phone  in line  remote phone  acknowledges the connection in line  line component  reinvites calling phone  to the call in lines  and  the reinvitation is acknowledged after line  an rtp media stream exists between remote phone  and phone  it will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed
