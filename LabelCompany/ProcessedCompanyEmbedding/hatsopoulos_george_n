engineering with the goal of becoming both an inventor and a businessman forty years later in an age focused on core competencies his company thermo electron corporation is a pacesetter eager to experiment with new technologies and build new subsidiaries around them dr hatsopoulos transformed a once small laboratory into a world leader in environmental monitoring biomedical manufacturing and many other specialized products and technologies the company employs over  people and has annual sales of  billion you cant be enamored with technology dr hatsopoulos has said you must instead be driven by the needs of the marketplace that pragmatic philosophy has been a useful guide to the founder and now chief executive officer of the waltham massachusettsbased thermo electron corporation dr hatsopoulos success began when he devised a theoretical engine that converted heat directly into electricity without using any moving parts his thermionic converter the first in an impressive string of technological innovations became the catalyst for the creation of a company that is today an international leader in manufacturing based on an everincreasing number of ideas and technologies coming from thermo electron the company is often referred to as a perpetual idea machine dr hatsopoulos sees those ideas not just as new products but also as seeds for new businesses he developed a strategy to make each new technology the core of its own new subsidiary armed with the flexibility and resources to explore further innovation thermo electron is now parent to  of these spinout companies all designed to motivate entrepreneurship thermo electron is careful to explain that it spins out not spins off its companies the company always retains a majority stake in each new endeavor and offers its new stock to the public and not to existing shareholders the corporate parent then continues to provide strategic planning employee benefits and pension fund management executive recruiting and other internal administration services thus freeing up the subsidiary to focus on innovation and market needs dr hatsopoulos formula for success is really very simple he seeks to anticipate societys problems develop the technology to solve them and have the product on line in time to meet the need but it is in his implementation of that formula that he stands apart as a business leader in creating a new corporate structure he has discovered a way to sustain growth in todays rapidly changing world markets note this profile is excerpted from the commemorative brochure published at the
