are called the “company” or “oakridge” and all references to “our” “us” and “we” refer to oakridge holdings inc and its subsidiary collectively unless the context otherwise requires  the company has one business segment — aviation ground support equipment the company was incorporated as a minnesota corporation in  and began operations on march   with two cemeteries in cook county illinois selling cemetery property merchandise and service  on june   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of stinar corporation a minnesota corporation  stinar corporation has been in business for  years and is an established international manufacturer and its products are used by the airline support equipment industry   stinar is a global manufacturer of ground support equipment for the aviation industry which is used for servicing loading and maintaining all types of aircraft for both commercial and government aviation companies and airports  these products are sold and marketed through our technically oriented sales staff as well as through independent distributors and sales representatives  approximately  of stinar’s revenues in the year ended june   were generated by contracts with the us government  were generated internationally and  were generated in the united states from nongovernmental sales  in year ended june   approximately  of stinar’s revenues were generated by contracts with the us government  were generated internationally and  were generated in the united states from nongovernmental sales  on june   the company entered into an asset purchase with kruckeberg industries llc a delaware limited liability company  pursuant to the agreement the company and stinar agreed to sell to purchaser substantially all of the assets owned by stinar including the premises located at  sibley memorial highway eagan minnesota  used in the operation of the business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in cash subject to upward or downward adjustment based on the current liabilities to be purchased and assumed by purchaser pursuant to the agreement   all references to years are to fiscal years ended june  unless otherwise stated   stinar corporation overview   stinar provides products and services to the aviation industry in three principal areas  i sales of new equipment manufactured for maintaining servicing and loading of airplanes ii sales of parts for equipment sold in the past and iii repair of equipment principal products of stinar include the following   truckmounted stairways and push stairs for loading aircraft lavatory trucks and carts water trucks bobtails and catering trucks for servicing aircraft cabin cleaning trucks maintenance hilifts and turbo oilers for maintaining aircraft and other custom built aviation ground support equipment used by airports airlines and the military  stinar also provides service and repairs on other vendors’ equipment and equipment it has sold the company purchases carbon steel stainless steel aluminum and chassis domestically  we do not use singlesource suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases and believe supplies of raw material available in the market are adequate to meet our needs  we historically have engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products and processes  a large part of our product development spending in the past has focused on the new product lines in the stairs department   aviation ground support industry   government contracts  contracts with the us government are subject to special laws and regulations noncompliance with which could result in various sanctions the aviation ground support industry internationally is characterized by the following fundamental attributes highly fragmented ownership  a significant majority of aviation ground support equipment manufacturers consist of familyowned businesses  management estimates that there are approximately  companies in the world that manufacture one or two products for the industry  also as a support industry ground support equipment has few market drivers of its own  that is the major determinants of ground support equipment market activity are to be found in the commercial aviation industry  under these conditions many suppliers have indepth knowledge only of their own market niches and endusers may have difficulty finding a supplier with the right mix of products and services to fit their needs size and growth trends  the aviation ground support industry appears to be taking on the characteristics of a shrinking and declining industry over the next couple of years  given the weakness of the four main indicators aircraft movements aircraft delivery rates price of fuel and airport constructioncapacity improvement of the industry’s health as well as the continuing decline in markets for import and export the world market for purchases of new aviation ground support equipment is expected to decline drastically due to most airlines downsizing operations and many large domestic carriers having filed for bankruptcy protection over the last several years barriers to entry  it is relatively difficult for new competitors to enter the field due to i high startup costs which effectively protect against small competitors entering the field ii substantial expertise required with regard to manufacturing and engineering difficulties which makes it difficult to have the knowledge to compete and iii market saturation which reduces the possibility of competitors gaining a meaningful foothold and network of manufacturing representatives  moreover airline companies are becoming increasingly selective about which companies they will allow to provide ground support equipment  most airlines only purchase from vendors who have a history in the industry   financial information about stinar   the following table summarizes the assets revenues and operating profit or loss attributable to the company’s aviation industry and corporate operations for the dates and periods indicated  the company evaluates the company’s performance based on operating profit loss   as of and for the fiscal years ended

regulations   stinar is required to comply with competitive bidding and other requirements in cases where it sells to local state or federal governmental customers the costs and effects of complying with these requirements do not have a material impact on the financial results of the company the company holds all governmental licenses necessary to carry on its business and all such licenses are current  the company is subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act “osha” and comparable state statutes  the osha hazard communication standard the unites states environmental protection agency community righttoknow regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations  certain portions of this information must be provided to employees state and local governmental authorities and local citizens    compliance with environmental laws   stinar owns a  square foot manufacturing facility located on approximately  acres of land the “stinar facility” in an industrial park in eagan minnesota a suburb of st paul minnesota  prior to the acquisition of the stinar facility in  stinar and the company obtained a phase i environmental assessment of the stinar facility  this phase i environmental assessment suggested the need for additional study of the stinar facility  in addition the phase i assessment suggested that certain structural improvements be made to the stinar facility  accordingly two additional phase ii environmental assessments were performed and revealed the presence of certain contaminants in the soil around and under the building located on the stinar facility subsequent to the completion of the phase ii environmental assessments and completion of the structural improvements to the building the company and stinar requested and obtained a no association letter from the minnesota pollution control agency mpca stating that provided that certain conditions set forth in the no association letter are met the company and stinar will not be deemed responsible for contamination that occurred at the stinar facility prior to the purchase of the assets of stinar by the company the structural improvements recommended by the companys environmental consulting firm have been completed and the contaminated soil has been removed and transferred from the property as a result mpca issued the no association letter as requested by kruckeberg industries llc from january  to march  landmark environmental llc conducted a phase i environmental test and a supplemental phase ii environmental test and revealed that areas of buried debris and impacted soils should be excavated and transported offsite for disposal to allow for future redevelopment of the property the quote for excavation is around  the company is planning to do the excavation in    competition   factors determining competitive success in stinar aviation manufacturing include price service location quality and technological innovation  competition is strong in all markets served the aviation ground support equipment business is extremely fragmented and diverse  the purchasers of the types of equipment manufactured by stinar tend to be longstanding repeat customers of the same manufacturers with quality reliability pricing warranties after market service and delivery being the key factors cited by customers in selecting an aviation ground support equipment supplier  accordingly while the market for stinar equipment is competitive the company believes that stinar’s reputation for quality and reliable equipment and the industry’s familiarity with stinar puts it on equal footing with its competitors  major domestic competitors include global ground support llc in catering equipment liftaloft corporation and nmcwollard in passenger stairs liftaloft corporation nmcwollard and phoenix metal products in lavatory and water carts and tesco equipment corporation liftaloft corporation phoenix metal products and nmcwollard in hilift equipment  international competitors include mullaghan engineering and tld inc in catering equipment and stairs and accessair systems inc and vestergaard company inc in water and lavatory carts   marketing   the chief method of marketing stinar’s equipment is through oneonone customer contact made by sales employees of stinar and manufacturers’ representatives under contract with stinar  stinar’s customers report that stinar has a reputation in the commercial aviation industry for manufacturing highquality reliable equipment  stinar intends to capitalize on this reputation in the domestic airline industry by reducing the amount of time needed to complete customer orders  stinar has also engaged manufacturers’ representatives to assist it in increasing sales to overseas markets   credit policies   stinar does not extend longterm credit to customers       international   stinar’s sales to customers outside the united states represented approximately  and  of stinar’s net sales in  and  respectively products are manufactured and marketed through the company’s sales department and sales representatives around the world     other business influences   the company believes that its business is highly dependent upon the profitability of its customers in the airline and air cargo markets and therefore the company’s profitability is affected by fluctuations in passenger and freight traffic and volatility of operating expenses including the impact of costs related to labor fuel and airline security  sales to the united states government also expose stinar to government spending cuts andor temporary shutdown of the government due to debt limits  the united states air force which historically has been a major purchaser of the company’s equipment is dependent upon governmental funding approvals  significant changes in raw material prices such as steel and chassis will also continue to impact our results  as of march   the company had approximately a  backlog the backlog is due to commercial sales in the united states the diversity of stinar’s customer base and equipment lines helps mitigate the risks of stinar’s business as does the growing importance of marketing internationally which provides stinar with an additional customer base not influenced as greatly by us economic conditions or us politics  we will also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for allocating capital  these factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook product obsolescence and the competitive environment   the company does not believe that the present overall rate of inflation will have a significant impact on the business segments in which it operates   employees   as of june   the company had  fulltime employees

item     legal proceedings   the company is a party to a number of legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business  while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on the company  as of june   there were no legal proceedings in either business we carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits consistent with our assessment of risks in our businesses and of an acceptable level of financial exposure  although there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to mitigate all damages claims or contingencies we believe that our insurance provides reasonable coverage for known asserted or unasserted claims  in the event the company sustained a loss from a claim and the insurance carrier disputed coverage or coverage limits the company may record a charge in a different period than the recovery if any from the insurance carrier   item    mine

operations and cash flows of the company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” we continue to evaluate the potential steps to remediate such material weaknesses as described below     management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a and d — f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that    ●     pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company   ●     provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

weaknesses described below the company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting    material weakness in internal control over financial reporting   a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in connection with its assessment management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at june     ●     due to the limited number of company personnel a lack of segregation of duties exists  an essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed  this is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person our management plans to explore implementing costeffective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements   ●     due to weaknesses

control over financial reporting as defined by rules af and df under the exchange act that have materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   remediation actions   in response to these material weaknesses we developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in fiscal year  we implemented the following remediation actions during the year ended june      segregation of duties   ●     engaged a third party specialist for advice and consultation    ●     provided training and education to different accounting functions ●     established review controls   financial reporting control   ●     provided training for calculating the cost of raw materials work in progress and finished goods  ●     completed review of the companys critical accounting and internal control policies with third party advisors that are knowledgeable regarding gaap and internal controls ●     provided training and

management intends to continue its remediation efforts by   ●     provide ongoing training and education relating to gaap around complex and nonroutine transactions specifically identified through regular review of emerging issues and company business activities ●     completing our review with the assistance of a third party advisor of the company’s financial reporting controls and implementing recommended control procedures to strengthen the company’s control procedures in areas which involve significant judgements and estimates which involve application of complex accounting methods under gaap or which could have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements   we are committed to a strong internal control environment and believe that when fully implemented the remediation actions described above will represent significant improvements in the company’s accounting and financial reporting functions the company has hired a fulltime controller and had made tremendous progress with improving the training and education of staff and added the additional internal control processes designed to remediate these material weaknesses during the balance of  we

standards accounting board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers asu  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under united states generally accepted accounting procedures gaap the core principles of asu  is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu  defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing gaap the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu  recognized at the date of adoption  which includes additional footnote disclosures we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu  on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in  the company currently plans to adopt the standard using the “modified retrospective method” under that method we will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of january   recognizing in the beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosure comparing results to previous accounting standards upon initial evaluation we believe the requirements of this standard will not result in a significant change to our results   aviation ground support equipment   revenue is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the

realized the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution management also assesses whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties the companys policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense the company has not identified any material uncertain tax
