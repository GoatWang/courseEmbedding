video gaming industry march   sign up for our free video newsletter here httpbitlynvkpr paresh davecontact reporter jack and paullie etienne cofounders of professional esports teams are so obsessed with winning that they cut off their players’ internet at  am to encourage decent rest before practicethe etiennes measure how much players practice including on their own time and how encouraging they are toward teammates rule breakers get a talkingto and they afford players at cloud esports inc a full range of paid benefits including meals and trainers healthcare and retirement plans to reduce their stress cloud’s efforts — many of them trailblazing in the nascent competitive video gaming industry — have turned the etiennes and their los angeles operation into a dependable source of ideas for their peers but in cloud’s latest move they’re the ones catching up with the crowdthe company announced tuesday it had received an unspecified investment of at least several million dollars the money probably will pay for entry fees and also could go toward university partnerships and a more central headquarters cloud has  teams whose more than  million fans collectively spend  million hours each month following their exploits the etiennes said that audience has the foundation for building an entertainment and sports company that will be around for decades“there’s no person better to learn this industry from than jack” said dan fiden of lead investor funplus ventures “this is the most important esports team in north america”the etiennes hadnt needed outside financing before the married couple had used their own few thousand dollars in  to start cloud after quitting their sales jobs in tech they secured sponsorship agreements before ever signing a player enabling their business to be profitable from day one that cash has fueled expansion to a series of regularly topfinishing teams across several video game leaguesbut it’s possible that getting into competitions let alone maintaining excellence could get very expensive league operators such as activision blizzard and riot games are exploring charging teams for rights to compete that would be a massive upfront cost in addition to keeping up with rising player expenses many esports teams have taken investment in recent years from venture capitalists basketball team owners and professional athletes the etiennes who first considered selling cloud amid the escalating challenges realized they’d rather follow suit with raising money so they could be winners for years to come“i am the only owner of a team that goes to every game and sits with my team every day because i … love this” said jack  using colorful language “i’m  driven on winning and not interested in things that don’t get us there but the money is going to be going to make sure i can actually play the game”cloud investors include the investment arm of video game company funplus and united talent agency individuals contributing were tesla motors board members antonio gracias and kimbal musk early tesla investor bill lee and reddit cofounder alexis ohanian dodgers coowner todd boehly and golden state warriors coowner chamath palihapitiya invested too as did professional baseball player hunter pence and professional basketball player andrew bogutohanian a football and video game fan bought into cloud’s longterm road map over coffee with jack in san francisco a few months ago“there’s teams like the yankees — i’m not even a baseball fan — that have transcended a sport and become a gateway for people to get into the sport” ohanian said “it sounded like a vision for that it requires a really disciplined patience and there’s going to be people distracted by shiny objects you want someone who can hold the course”the etiennes who had a child shortly before launching cloud credit their pairing and work experience for their initial successmany early esports owners were former players by contrast jack sold software

practice rick loomis  los angeles times now they put their knowledge to work during weekly meetings with cloud sponsors to walk them through ad plans and performance the people on the other side of the table are taking a gamble betting on an unproven sport and jack said it’s his job to make sure those people have enough information to boast about when they go back to their bosses those sponsorship deals have became an industry standard he saidon the other side of the operation his experience as talent scout for a “world of warcraft” computer game group has served him well in evaluating players to sign and how to help teams gelit also was crunchyroll where the entire journey began jack got introduced by a client there to a backwardhat shorts and tanktop wearing gamer whose “league of legends” video game fan website was taking off andy dinh then  wanted help selling ads and offered jack the job immediately“i was thinking no way am i quitting a paycheck to work for this kid” jack recalled but jack was open to helping out if he could keep his day jobcrunchyroll and dinh agreed and the partnership flourished dinh had enough cash to start his own professional team and it quickly became championshipcaliber jack relished in the success but doing well came with increasing dutiesit wasn’t long before he went all in and formed his own team and his wife agreed to come along they moved to los angeles from san francisco“we wanted to do something for ourselves” paullie  said and coming off maternity leave “it seemed like really good timing”marcus “dyrus” hill a former titlewinning player for dinh’s team described jack as someone who’s committed to guiding “his players to be the best they can be”that’s essential because as the second most popular north american team cloud keeps dinh’s squad “on their toes” hill saidjack had waited several dates to describe his obsession for gaming to paullie who didn’t share the passion and even fibbed about the amount he playedwhen paullie saw the real number was  to  hours a week on top of a regular job she didn’t balk instead she’s gone on to become cloud’s chief operating officer the husbandandwife duo she said
