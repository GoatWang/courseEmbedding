highquality coke used in the blast furnace production of steel and provides export and domestic coal handling services to the coke coal steel and power industries  in our cokemaking business we utilize an innovative heatrecovery technology that captures excess heat for steam or electrical power generation and have longterm takeorpay coke contracts that pass through commodity and certain operating costs  our coal handling terminals have the collective capacity to blend and transload more than  million tons of coal each year and are strategically located to reach gulf coast east coast

industry  to learn more about suncoke energy partners lp visit our website at wwwsuncokecom definitions adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest loss gain on extinguishment of debt taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of cmt and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations  adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses  management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the partnerships net assets and its ability to incur and service debt fund capital expenditures and make distributions  adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and they should not be considered an alternative to net income operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda attributable to sxcp equals adjusted ebitda less adjusted ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests distributable cash flow equals adjusted ebitda plus sponsor support and coal logistics deferred revenue less net cash paid for interest expense ongoing capital expenditures accruals for replacement capital expenditures and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests plus amounts received under the omnibus agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be expansion capital under our partnership agreement  distributable cash flow is a nongaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of sxcps financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies use to assess sxcps operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships without regard to historical cost basis the ability of sxcps assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to sxcps unitholders sxcps ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities we believe that distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing sxcps financial condition and results of operations  distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income operating income cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap  distributable cash flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities  additionally because distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry our definition of distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility ongoing capital expenditures capex are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets andor to extend their useful lives  ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency reliability or effectiveness of existing assets  ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred or significant capital expenditures for purposes of calculating distributable cash flow the portion of ongoing capex attributable to sxcp is used and includes capital expenditures included in working capital at the end of the period replacement capital expenditures capex represents an annual accrual necessary to fund sxcps share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives this accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives  the replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by sxcps general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex provided such change is approved by our conflicts committee forwardlooking statements some of the statements included in this press release constitute forwardlooking

carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the final regulations the partnership previously received a willlevel opinion from its counsel vinson  elkins llp that the partnerships cokemaking

suncoke energy partners lp visit our website at wwwsuncokecom definitions adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest loss gain on extinguishment of debt taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of cmt and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations  adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses  management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the partnerships net assets and its ability to incur and service debt fund capital expenditures and make distributions  adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and they should not be considered an alternative to net income operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda attributable to sxcp equals adjusted ebitda less adjusted ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests distributable cash flow equals adjusted ebitda plus sponsor support and coal logistics deferred revenue less net cash paid for interest expense ongoing capital expenditures accruals for replacement capital expenditures and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests plus amounts received under the omnibus agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be expansion capital under our partnership agreement  distributable cash flow is a nongaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of sxcps financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies use to assess sxcps operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships without regard to historical cost basis the ability of sxcps assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to sxcps unitholders sxcps ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities we believe that distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing sxcps financial condition and results of operations  distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income operating income cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap  distributable cash flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities  additionally because distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry our definition of distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility ongoing capital expenditures capex are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets andor to extend their useful lives  ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency reliability or effectiveness of existing assets  ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred or significant capital expenditures for purposes of calculating distributable cash flow the portion of ongoing capex attributable to sxcp is used and includes capital expenditures included in working capital at the end of the period replacement capital expenditures capex represents an annual accrual necessary to fund sxcps share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives this accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives  the replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by sxcps general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex

qualifying income prior to the final regulations therefore the partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the
