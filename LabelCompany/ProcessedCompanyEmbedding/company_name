independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is

here copy courses copy tutorials testimonials day launch plan find a copywriter copywriting growth marketing freelancing joanna wiebe copyhackers  comments min read growth marketing how to name a product – do this avoid that the name you give your product service or company today is going to stick with it much the same the way that “joanna banana” and “dweeb wiebe” have stuck with me yes i realize putting “dweeb wiebe” out there may not be helping the cause to wipe it from the face of the earth we all know that names stick around bad or good and in most cases for most startups we immediately think of longevity as soon as we consider naming our businesses and our products will the name stick will people like the sound of it in  years will it continue to describe what we do and offer will it be outdated like myspace tomorrow longevity stickiness those are good qualities for names great qualities fanfreakin’tastic qualities but what about all the other things you should be thinking about when naming the list of what to do – and what to avoid doing – when it comes to naming isn’t uberlong… but it’s definitely worth reading as you name a product or company rebrand optimize your product names but before we get into ye olde list first things first we’ve got to think about the entity we’re naming so… ask yourself these questions before you tattoo “zeebledodocom” on your arm what follows here is a list of real questions from a real brief a real creative agency would send to you before they started working on naming your product let me repeat because i know you like the sound of my nagging voice this is not just a checklist on a blog post – so be a good copy hacker and read this then act on your answers to these qs am i naming a product or a company products can be discontinued or sunsetted down the road and digital products – which don’t normally have packaging – can have their names switched with ease but company names are the foundation of both your brand and your future earnings  should the name be long or short what’s the character limit if this product is going to be listed in a catalog online you will likely have a character limit few names on software catalogs wrap and consider the digital side of your product marketing if you’re writing about the product in a subject line you don’t want it to be  characters in length – ‘cos your subject line should be  characters or fewer yes that rule still applies know your limit name within it  what is the purpose of the product i’m naming what is its value if you’ve got a brand new offering with no competitors as with inventions you may want to opt for a more descriptive name if you’re entering a space with lots of competitors you may want to keep your usp frontofmind when naming think freshbooks vs quickbooks  who is my target audience who is most likely to see the name and buy what’s more important when naming than the audience that’s looking to buy your solution don’t ask them what to name it but do ask them other questions in surveys like ruben gamez did he went from the names “basic” and “premium” for his products… to the names “freelance” “studio” and “agency” – all based on what his users told him in a survey  how does my target audience talk what is their education and reading level what are the names of products they buy and love i’m thinking “omgfacts” here need i say more  would my audience be more receptive to a real word or a brand spankin’ new word that i make up graduate students may expect a name that’s more x and tweens may expect a name that’s more y and tweens who are planning to go to grad school may expect a name that’s more z  should the name evoke some sort of emotion–is emotion important to converting people huggies comes to mind it’s a freakin’ diaper… but the name doesn’t sound like that’s all it’s about  should the name consider gender this could be important if you’re introducing a product that is wellknown as serving one gender to the other gender like undereye cream for men  in what channels will it be used only on my site… or in print materials in packaging on tshirts on tv commercials on the radio when designers create logos they think about how it will look when stitched on a hat and when displayed online you as a copy hacker need to think about the words – particularly the sound of the words the pronunciation is it easy to pronounce easy to repeat or is it a tonguetwister waiting to happen  will people outside my country see it globalization folks if it can be found and bought online chances are good people from egypt korea scotland and the ukraine will see it they could be customers in some cases like digital products so what might your product name mean in their language and unique cultural context i was once naming a product for banks in india and i recommended “momo”… which i quickly learned is some kind of dumpling the banks did not want to be associated with a dumpling so that was the end of that  if there’s a larger family of product names what common thread runs through those am i willing to change all the names or should the name instead fit the family once apple named the ipod the rest of the family that followed it had to lead with the “i” including the ipad of course interesting fact before the ipad was launched naming guru hayes roth of landor noted that there was concern it sounded too much like a feminine hygiene product once the product launched it never came up again read more about this on the atlantic  are there competitors in this category with names i should be considering whether i’m planning on steering clear of those names or copying ’em if you’re naming a car you might not want to start it with an “f” unless you’re naming a card for ford — fusion f and focus on the other hand if you’re naming a car and you want it to be considered in the league of bmw you may want to number the car and the others in the family  does traffic generation matter a lot to me an oftenoverlooked way to arrive at a name is by doing some keyword research after all when your product’s name appears on your site – and it normally appears in numerous places – that’s an organic keyword consider keywords – like “free invoicing” and “universal phone charger” – when taking a more literal spin with your naming may seem like a lot of questions but i’d put money on the likelihood of most people – including you – actually thinking about this stuff when it comes time to name something in business you just don’t write the questions down as i have above assess your shortlist of product names once you’ve brainstormed using the above list name ideas may start popping into your head write them all down this could mean writing down s trust me agencies go through hundreds of names in this process your startup should do the same when you’ve whittled down your list assess the shortlist against these questions is it easy to remember is it easy to understand is it easy to pronounce is it accessible to my target audience that is do they need to have special knowledge they don’t have to ‘translate’ it and understand think google nike and kijiji is it trademarked or copyrighted is the domain name available are there any negative connotations or associations with it choosing your name what to do… and what to avoid what to do be more memorable with alliteration like paypal and lincoln logs keep it short make sure it’s easy to pronounce make sure that when you pronounce it it doesn’t sound like something else make sure that when it’s written in a domain name as  word it doesn’t look like something else test the name in context – like on your website “plans  pricing” page consider how a tagline might fit with it and remember that abstract names often require descriptive tags   what to avoid generic soulless names proving how clever you are – “clear” is still a great copy strategy in naming knocking off the competition  playing the copycat asking people explicitly for feedback on your name – especially whether they “like it” or not using literal or highly descriptive phraseswords your competitors can imitate words that are commonly misspelled eg “public” often loses its “l” – i’m not kidding… i’ve seen this x in publications recently as a final thought today consider this over  trademark applications were filed in the united states in  and over  percent of the dictionary is registered as a “dot com” moral of the story naming is hard but when you put in the time upfront – without losing your passion vision and creativity – you can land on a cool name… which you can then test with customers by scoring memorability suitability and negpos associations fun you may also like  facebook ad hacks for when

namingservices what a great post well done joanna…naming a product should be like love at first …its make great impression on the product for the peoples contact our product naming company to get some advice on how to name your product rolling names great article joanna justin march what a fantastic article joanna well done i somewhat agree with jim “if you don’t make any huge mistakes your reputation for providing value is far more important” a real revelation for me was when i read positioning the battle for your mind by al reis my feeling is that your brand is the foundation on which your marketing plan sits your name is secondary to your brand but they are still obviously connected i don’t believe that anyone gets it  right and there are other constraints as well which domains are available whats your budget sorting out a name is therefore a tough thing to do naming is hard i think that the secret lies in positioning if you position your brand correctly often you are treading new ground and are more likely to avoid trademark issues and domain name scarcity jim gray great analysis of a tricky and often stressful topic domain names  googleability add a twist say i register “fooappcom” for a singleproduct business are people going to call me “foo” or “fooapp” in conversation if i use a business name distinct from the product name foo by bar  fooappcom will people recognize “bar” or just “foo” if the business expands in the future if people search for “foo” or “bar” by name will it automatically rank fooappcom first on google or will there be collisions with other names but i think the biggest rule of naming is “if you don’t make any huge mistakes your reputation for providing value is far more important” what’s a ford or a disney or a xerox anyway these names are already good by joanna’s criteria but we know them because their owners built things and brought them to market if you’re preproduct don’t obsess over naming for too long maybe even put it off by picking a provisional name then come back once you have a firmer grasp on the personality of your brand and a better understanding of your market joanna wiebe i can’t agree more with you on the “don’t obsess over naming” part although a name can help shape a brand’s personality and even the direction of the product… that might be a bad thing in your earliest stages it’s like allowing a baby to name itself if babies could talk you don’t even know who you are yet or what you stand for so start with something but be flexible enough that you’re okay with changing it even just a little

as its own word acu is seen as a prefix or a bound morpheme that must connect to a free morpheme like vue phonemes are minimal units of sound depending on the speaker’s accent the english language has about  phonemes in product naming names that are phonetically easy to pronounce and that are well balanced with vowels and consonants have an advantage over those that are not likewise names that begin with or stress plosive consonant sounds b hard c d g k p or t are often used because of their attentiongetting quality some phoneme sounds in english for example l v f and w are thought of as feminine while others such as x m and z are viewed as masculine syntax or word order is key to consumers’ perceptions of a product name banana republic would not carry the same meaning were it changed

trademarks may be established in a number of ways in many countries including the united states names can be used as trademarks without formal registration through first use or common law—simply to protect an established product’s name and reputation product names can be formally registered within a state with protection limited to that state’s borders in the united states a federal trademark registration is filed with the uspto and offered protection for as long as the mark is in use the preeminent system for registering international trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is the madrid system in addition protecting a trademark is just as important as the initial process of registration trademark rights are maintained through actual use of the trademark and will diminish over time if a trademark is not actively used companies need to consider whether they can own a name in the digital realm securing a domain name particularly with the globally recognized dotcom extension is critical for some companies it has also become increasingly important for firms to interact with their audience through social media websites social media sites like facebook twitter pinterest and

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is here to

your name gets out there and your company grows so much of your sales and future growth come from having a truly kickass name a good name and matching domain lets anyone who hears it know a ton about your business   your name tells people about your values the quality of your product or service whether or not you are a big established company hint its almost always better to sound more established

need to have a name that is catchy tells people who you are and also fits well into a wwwyournamecom so people can find you right away   but how the heck do you do it   well you can try guessing…thats what most people do   theyll go into godaddycom or some other domain registrar and guess at names based on the urls available some of them get lucky but most of them fail   thats why you see so many long domains like reallyreallylongdomainnamecom yuck   is there a way to find good names that are catchy good for search engines and easily marketable   there absolutely is a fastgrowing company
