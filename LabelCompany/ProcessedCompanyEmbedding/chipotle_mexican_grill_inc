restaurants nightlife home services write a review events talk log in     a el monte avemountain view ca    the staff here was aces today they engaged the little boy i had with me and were super friendly and kind they all seemed to have a good relationship and that always gives a place a better vibe i just wish it wasnt so damn cold inside my little mans quesadilla was cold way too soon and i was freezing in a hoodie but the food is always great and the service is super efficient and i always enjoy reading their bags and cups update no change in hours posted for the sunday before the july th holiday which is a tuesday by the way however the doors were closedlocked and window shades pulled this was  on sunday  if youre gonna close your store early at least post prior notice or make it on the hour youre supposed to close at pm not just whenever you feel like it would give  stars if possible i absolutely agree with the other reviews the service here is slow underprepared and the food is typically put together sloppily unprofessional conversations and comments are carried on behind the counters only problem is the counter doesnt do anything to drown out the discussions they often run of out items the food is standard for a chipotle but they are grossly understaffed and often the line is almost to the door this unfortunately doesnt make anyone move any faster the staffing issue is apparent when food bits are cross contaminated into other bins and on the counter space between items i wish there was another mountain viewlos altos location nearby i wish i could give  stars to this place we came here on a monday evening to grab a burrito bowl first time at this location and there were only two people in line in front of us somehow it took at least  minutes till we finally could pay for our food they had  young and extremely slow people working on the line and another one walking around doing nothing they assembled our bowls and put them aside to start assembling the other ones for the next cutomers in line our bowls were getting cold and we had to wait a while till they took care of a couple in front of us which took forever ive never seen service being so slow without any legitimate reason for it to be so slow the food was a disaster too  the steak was tasteless and had a rubberlike texture that made me feel like i could break my teeth if i kept eating it guacamole was disgusting the taste didnt even remind of avocado and made me gag note to management train your employees improve efficiency and food quality cons brown rice was undercooked chicken was not salted at all and had no flavor carnitas and chips were way over salted fajitas were under cooked and too hard employee looked miserable pros guac was fresh steak was good crap service crap location lettuce looked days old employees were really grumpy which means chipotle treats their people like shi shame im not giving steve ells or any of his other corporate goons another dime chipotle has become a revived favorite of mine since their chiptopia rewards program rolled out earlier this summer and since they cleaned up their food quality problems it seems redundant to review a national chain because they rotate their employees and management so much and because the quality is meant to be uniform but the point is that not every chipotle is run the same way unfortunately this particular location is pretty good compared to others though the line moves fast the workers are friendly they dont skimp on their portions and the food is the usual standard quality they even go above and beyond to drip the beans and the pico de gallo before they drop it in your bowl the end result the properlybalanced chipotle burrito bowl that you would expect at any other location but always ends up escaping you anyway this location does it right and serves it with a smile the previous reviewers are on point when they say terrible customer service the guy assembling our food gave us a big attitude about having multiple orders he slopped together our order and threw the spoons into the containers each time as if to confirm his annoyance he also did an awful job wrapping our burrito with the tortilla splaying out whoever manages this location needs to really clean up this shop get rid of employees who dont care or want to be here no one wants to pay to get their food thrown together with a huge dose of unwarranted rudeness the customer service here is laughable as in it sucks big time ive been here more than a few times and there are  guys who are consistently friendly but the rest of the people just hate making delicious burritos one of the guys barely said two words and pointed at each ingredient as a way of asking if i wanted it ive also seen one of the guys who was making the guac sneakily shove a tortilla chip in his mouth lulz everything else is fine honestlythe food quality is uptopar the location has tons of indoor  outdoor seating and a decently large parking lot one of the worst experiences ever rude employees making my sandwich like shoveling mud no thank you no hello and dont even ask me what i want just looking at me  and constantly joking with each other i wonder does this place has a manager i will never go back to this store even if its free if i could give this place zero stars i would they had  i repeat  people working an only  person helping make the damn food dont go to this place its a fucking joke when you only have  people in front of you and it takes mins for them to take your order smfh i wish there was a negative stars option this location is horrible in fact its the worst location i have ever been to they need new management the sofritas and beans are cold the fajita veggies are always burnt with lots of hard burnt pieces ruining the flavor of your bowlburrito the guy making my bowl was ghetto like sagging pants covered in tattoos and not artist ones really poorly done ones and he looked unhygienic furthermore he was not friendly at all and was acting like i was waisting his time when we were the only ones in the line super attitude the dinning room was empty yet the tables were dirty all of the employees were in the back and the guy who made out bowls had to call back there to get someone to ring us up i have never seen such horrible employees at a chipotle and i wouldnt be surprised if this location shut down i love chipotle but this location has the worst customer service it seems to me when a company has recently suffered losses and customers as much as chipotle youd think management would work hard to keep their remaining customers last night i ordered a chicken salad and a chicken bowl i was given a small amount of white rice in my bowl and politely asked the female employee two times for more rice ordered extra chicken for the salad and chips  guacamole nothing more pretty simple but after i came home this is what i was charged chicken bowl      veggie  pointer   extra chicken   chips  guac   total after tax   wow thanks for ripping me off jose i still love chipotle but not this location there was no one else in line and i still felt rushed so much so that i forgot to ask for refried beans in my chicken bowl that never happens at the sunnyvale location and the employees dont pad the bill either came here yesterday friday for dinner only to find that the store was closed due to not having any hot water came back tonight pm for a chorizo bowl to find that there was barely and chorizo left and not even any being cooked for its replacement they tell me itll be  minutes to cook so i said ill wait it took  min i have never step foot inside this location but had such an incredible customer experience over the phone that i just had to share the boyfriend forgot his wallet at home hrs away one day and i scrambled to find a way to ensure he gets fed for lunch thank goodness for online ordering as im going through the process the earliest pickup time is past his scheduled lunch hour i take it one step further by trying my luck by calling the store location i talk to this guy alex i think i tell him my situation and he offers to speed things up for him if he just comes inside and orders directly inperson i tell him that i need to specifically place the order online so that i may use my credit card to pay for the meal this guy takes it to another level and offers for my boyfriend to ask for him directly and will comp his meal full transparency my efforts took so long that my boyfriend didnt have enough time to take advantage of the offer but considering the thoughtfulness of this guy over the phone and the fact that he spent all that time with me on the phone on a very busy lunch rush with a large catering order to attend to i could not let this go unnoticed plus in the event the guy i spoke to is reading this it makes me feel better knowing why my boyfriend never showed up its just nice to know that there are still people out there who go the extra mile thank you havent been to a place with worse customer service than this establishment the guys behind the counter are more busy talking among themselves than listening to what i am asking them they just want to rush you through the assembly line if you have more than one order its a nightmare to get what you want one guy is adding white rice and another one is adding chicken even though what i wanted was brown rice and tofu they dont even bother asking makes wonder if these employees receive any training at all i have had this experience multiple times and not just at this chipotle location makes me think something is seriously wrong with how chipotle conducts business and what values it stands for absolutely disgusted this is the worst chipotle ever terrible customer service and the food is stale never coming back i write this as a fan of chipotle but i must say that this particular location is a blight on the overall company image ive been there twice in two days the place has an overall sloppy appearance the tables are not cleaned the staff is somewhat rude and informal and the fruit prep is sloppy and untrained ive seen two different personelle now wrap two different burritos making it into a ball rather than a cylinder completely falls apart and inedible sloppy and uncaring also the food quality the food did not taste fresh most notably the meat and the wrap on this last time i came out they were out of chips since when has chipotle ever been out of chips it happens at this location apparently they were completely out of napkins at the condiment section you would think for a chain that has had some food safety issues in the last few years that they would be doubling down on safety customer service and quality this place does not seem to of gotten the memo or follow the news if i had heard this location was the source of food safety concerns i would not in the least be surprised this location is in serious need of adult supervision this franchise owner is negligent in what theyre doing and chipotle corporate should take action immediately with this franchise owner dont know why everyones hating on this chipotle so much came here for a quick lunch and got my goto sofritas burrito to go staff wasnt too efficient line wait was about  minutes however they were polite there were about three people in the assembly line on thursday late afternoon around pmish heres the thinglunch rush is called lunch rush for a reason people only get an hour break so of course they was speedy service when theres high traffic you have to thank your chipotle assembly line soldiers they are doing this for basically  tip and your rudeness isnt going to rub them the right way i always thank my chipotle warriors and if youre doing a secret menu request or a secrets to chipotle insider move be cool about it the location is in the middle of a busy shopping plaza with many other food options around parking is a beezy because everything is so tight and narrowly spaced be careful not to dent anyone elses car i wouldnt come back to this location unless i happened to be in a rush and needed food on the way but this chipotle shouldnt deserve so much hate there are plenty of spots for diners and they also have an outdoors area for patio seating i personally prefer the cupertino or west san jo chipotle over this one but there wasnt any hatred towards this location like other yelpers have voiced below the service line was not organized and except for the cashier the folks were rude it was late maybe they were tired but being polite is a requirement in the hospitality industry they had run of chicken and i was informed after the fact of staying in line and half way through the line decent burrito not amazing but ok when we arrived the line was well over  people long if my gf didnt want chipotle id have left right then it took nearly  minutes of waiting in line for them to even ring up a customer we were in line about  minutes before we got up to the counter the employees work out of rythm with each other which slows the process down burritos sit on the cold counter with warm meat on them cooling then get watery ice cold sour cream put on them that guarantees your take out will be cold by the time you get anywhere all for only  with guacamole i wont be back chipotle mexican grill

other ones for the next cutomers in line our bowls were getting cold and we had to wait a while till they took care of a couple in front of us which took forever ive never seen service being so slow

chipotle has become a revived favorite of mine since their chiptopia rewards program rolled out earlier this summer and since they cleaned up their food quality problemsit seems redundant to review a national chain because they rotate their employees and management so much and because the quality is meant to be uniform but the point is that not every chipotle is run the same way unfortunately this particular location is pretty good compared to others thoughthe line moves fast the workers are friendly they dont skimp on their portions and the food is the usual standard quality they even go above and beyond to drip the beans and the pico de gallo before they drop it in your bowlthe end result the properlybalanced chipotle burrito bowl that you would expect at any other location but always ends

the process the earliest pickup time is past his scheduled lunch hour i take it one step further by trying my luck by calling the store location i talk to this guy alex i think i tell him my situation and he offers to speed things up for him if he just comes inside and orders directly inperson i tell him that i need to specifically place the order online so that i may use my credit card to pay for the meal this guy takes it to another level and offers for my boyfriend to ask for him directly and will comp his meal full transparency my efforts took so long that my boyfriend didnt have enough time to take advantage of the offer but considering the thoughtfulness of this guy over the phone and the fact that he spent all that time with me on the phone on a very busy lunch rush with a large

events talk log in     charleston rdmountain view ca    food is always amazing i come here all the time check my check ins  i go out of my way to come to this one customer service is always great francisco has such a great personality whats up with this chipotle i ordered steak bowl with all sides and got a half empty bowl i had  pieces of tiny steaks cubes in other chipotle i would get  times the portion i got today i get that some chipotle gives less than others but this is really beyond my expectation i still like chipotle but will stay away from this one from now on chipotle is terrible back in  or so mcdonalds had an investment in this awful company they make tacos and burritos like subway makes sandwiches but mexican food is supposed to be authentic this is not and even worse they use postmates for their deliveries postmates is a scam they pay all employees as independent contractors not just drivers boycott all chipotles uno mas is good or rubios taco bell upon entering i saw patrons eating hefty chipotle bowls only one person was in front of us in line a lady helped us with our two bowls and super skimped on our bowls i got the veggie bowl and always ask for extra bell pepper mix each tong full she gave was half of a normal scoop her rice was also half of a normal scoop too both guacamole containers were  full needless to say this was not a good visit our bowls were  full vs the normal  rude service too i find it hard to believe that anyone yes anyone let alone chipotle can make a terrible burrito but alas i learned today that its possible where do i start how about the tortilla being really hot on one side and freezing cold on the other or that the rice and chicken were barely lukewarm it was just a coldhot mess and honestly i resent having to pay  for guacamole for a burrito that should be illegal but never mind i wont be worrying about this ever again at a chipotle i used chipotle catering for the first time for a small work event and it was great the online ordering system is extremely easy to use and allows for modifications and special requests i chose to do pickup instead of delivery to ensure for the first time to ensure nothing was forgotten the food was hot and fresha and ready by the pickup time the manager even helped bring the food into the car included in the order are disposable chafing dishes and fuel which is made for very easy presentation i would definitely recommend chipotle for any catering needs in chipotle we trust this is my go to chipotle at first like everyone else i gave into the mistrust as the wide spew of health concerns exploded on news outlets on numerous occasions health scares definitely repel the crowds and im thankful that i get to enjoy my meal in peace this particular locations entrance faces the street and is right across from michaels so you have to walk around the plaza to find the door i find that most chipotles are just average i have yet to experience one that blows my mind but this chipotle in particular is more than sufficient i find that theyre very sparse when it comes to good customer service or a hefty scoop of protein they can get skimpy with their portions but most places are so unless you get double meat youre basically left with a bowl of beans lettuce and salsa juice i usually get the burrito bowl with brown rice black beans chicken corn pico lettuce sour cream and cheese the sour cream at chipotle is my favorite its so incredibly thick and dreamy unlike the quality of sour cream you get at your standard grocery store overall this is a chipotes that will satisfy for your clean mexican food cravings and provide a clean atmosphere to dine in vegetarian and low carb friendly i got a salad bowl with sofrito tofu and beans and cheese and grilled veggies and pico de gallo and salad dressing my carnivore partner was happy with whatever they put in his burrito fast prep and right near work who could ask for more oh and decent prices to under  for most entrees i am sure that i will be back i love chipotle but i wouldnt give them all a  star the other day there was a nice family in front of me with  children being children playing and running around having fun while in line the parents were obviously stressed out and were having a difficult time keeping the kids under control i found the experience rather comical but you could tell that the parents felt bad for me when one of the kids accidentally punch my leg apparently one of the chipotle employees felt bad as well because he ended up giving me my meal free of charge the staff here are amazing i eat at this chipotle all the time for lunch and the staff are always fantastic and ready to serve your meal with a smile ill definitely keep coming back i hope everyone has a great experience here like i do every time this place is pretty good i actually really like the flavors combining inside the burrito the grilled green peppers and onions give it a nice fajita flavor and i enjoy the corn salsa with its spicy kick it is a nice change of pace from the multitude mexican burrito places as it tastes a little different the reason i am only giving chipotle  stars is their dang cheapness on meat why so cheap i dont get it they go overboard on the filler of rice and beans leaving little space for the meat they then daintily sprinkle the meat on top like its gold chintzy chintzy chintzy if only they would train their people to be more generous i actually stopped going to chipotle because of this and only came back today after a very long time and yepstill cheapos on the meat i have eaten here many times but today the beef was clearly tasting like old meat that has gone bad i needed to buy a chicken taco to go after my dinner for someone else so i took it as a chance to let the server know he really didnt seem to care i recommended he taste one i wasnt really complaining more letting him know that there is something wrong i then mentioned it to the cashier and got the same non caring kind of response he mentioned that it must have been the style of the person preparing it that day i repeated that it was just  min ago no movement in any way to fix it for future customers nor taking care of my second order seeing the low reviews here now makes sense this chipotle is absolutely gross i go to chipotle almost every day the one on el camino and i never had a problem today was my first time trying this location with my co worker and we both threw our bowls away the guacamole was not right the recipe was off the steak was so hard i could not chew the lady gave me a half a scoop of rice i had to ask for more also the cook was just standing there on his phone this chipotle must be ran by a very cheap owner and a manager who does not care i literally stop to any chipotle i can when traveling i also used to work for chipotle so when it comes to customer service i know how it should and should not be like this one was the next offramp we get here and we werent even greeted the guy that started serving us looked like he hated it here and hated that he had to serve me he rushed through everything and almost put corn when i said no corn then he did the guacamole and i clearly saw a huge avocado slice not mashed and asked for him to take it out he acted like i was stupid and got a spoon and basically just moved it around and didnt even get it just plain out rude the fellow at the cashier was fine not energetic or anything but low and behold i sit down and theres a huge avocado slice just like i said there was  thanks dude but overall the food tastes really good just think yall need to fix your attitudes i was not amused and im sure a secret shopper wouldnt be amused and if this restaurant is even considered a restauranteur store i would literally be shocked i rarely visit chiptole since using their nutrition calculator httpschipotlecomnutritioncalculator frightening we have so many authentic mexican places to choose from why choose faux mexican but on this day we happened to be in that devils triangle of shopping costco bed bath beyond and rei we were hungry so decided to split a burrito when i requested that the burrito be cut in half the person making it said we are not allowed to do that and then directed me to the plastic cutlerystrange the burrito was not great the plastic cutlery the blaring music all made for an underwhelming experience i suppose the same people who like starbucks prefer a cookiecutter fastfood restaurant to the real dealnot me awarding two stars although that is generous imo i just wanted to give a shout out to my local chipotle im  months pregnant due any day now and ive been to chipotle more times during this pregnancy than i should probably admit to but every single employee there has been extremely kind and helpful over the last few months they have taken the time to get to know me check in on me have talked baby names held the door open even paid for my food themselves on multiple occasions so many small acts of friendliness have really made a difference and i really appreciate how wonderful everyone has been there are some great employees here and chipotle should be proud the place i go to for all of my chipotle needs what can i say about this place great location clean outdoor seating and quick service even when the line is out the door a little skimpy on the guacamole but if you ask for a little more they are pretty good about that the staff is very friendly and helpful i think a lot of people would agree with me that this location is a goto if youre in the area its nice to see a staff that always has a smile on their face after finishing the transaction never going back to this shthole while building a burrito i spotted charred black  burnt pieces of chicken when i pointed it out the employee just shrugged and mixed the burnt meat with the other unburnt pieces saying we grill our food i asked for the manager who was on break so i couldnt report this person serving burnt carcinogens to unsuspecting patrons let me start with this i am an avid chipotle fan during about a  year span i ate at chipotle at least once per week i just ate the worst burrito i have ever received there were only two people in line so im not sure what the rush was to finish my burrito but the european gentleman who was helping me didnt seem to have a clue though he was very nice i asked for a steak burrito which was looking good til i asked for lettuce i asked for a pinch of lettuce he grabbed possibly the largest handful i had ever seen ok all seems well first three bites all lettuce the first  of the burrito had  meat literally just lettuce rice and a fat ball of cheese i am disappointed and will not be returning to this chipotle enjoyed our carnitas bowls we always get double rice no beans because we like the cilantro rice so much reasonably healthy food very inexpensive the servers we had tonight werent very friendly  the cashier was more interested in cleaning up than ringing up which was nice but it was holding up the line we usually go to this location as the wait is less than the el monte location more tables  not as gloomy i usually order online and pick up in store but since they seem to always get my order incorrect i decided to walk in the line was short which was nice but the customer service was kinda blah i hate establishments where employees dont seem to enjoy where they work makes the whole experience pretty junk i hope this place gets it together soon chipotle mexican grill claimed this business has been claimed by the

michaels so you have to walk around the plaza to find the doori find that most chipotles are just average i have yet to experience one that blows my mind but this chipotle in particular is more than sufficient i find that theyre very sparse when it comes to good customer service or a hefty scoop of protein they can get skimpy with their portions but most places are so unless you get double meat youre basically left with a bowl of beans lettuce and salsa juicei usually get the burrito bowl with brown rice black beans chicken corn pico lettuce sour cream and cheese the sour cream at chipotle is my favorite its so incredibly thick and dreamy unlike the quality of sour cream you get at your standard grocery storeoverall this is a chipotes that will satisfy for your clean mexican food

nice change of pace from the multitude mexican burrito places as it tastes a little differentthe reason i am only giving chipotle  stars is their dang cheapness on meat why so cheap i dont get it they go overboard on the filler of rice and beans leaving little space for the meat they then daintily sprinkle the meat on top like its gold chintzy chintzy chintzy if only they would train their people

stanford mall the order was done right i paid quickly and they even wrote my name in my native language even though none of them were actually ethnically korean it was a nice touch and made me smile great branch kristy a  star rating  do not come here cars are getting baseball bats to windows of cars daily  cars today chipotle knows that this happens daily for the last  years my uncles car was smashed today police are here now was here today friday afternoon pm on  the customer service was great and so was portion sizes but as i was leaving i noticed  separate parking spaces with piles of broken car glass there has to be some tweakers or car thieves who live in the neighborhood people do not leave your worthy belongings in plain view always put them in the trunk yum i tried chipotle years ago and wasnt too happy about the inordinate amount of rice versus meat options so never went back however stopped by with the bf and tried one of their salad bowls and now im sold without the starch and all the greens and beanschickenguac ive met my match in mostly protein this is done cafeteria style so move along with your order i usually ask for the dressing on the side since it is oilbased but i usually get three meals out of one bowl quick efficient and the seating area is quite roomy and nice just make sure you get there to beat the lunch crowd it gets packed quickly the staff literally gave me  pieces of veggies and  pieces of chicken as if they are doing me a favor i had to ask multiple times to give me more but the guy continued picking piece by piece i hope its not a chipotle wide thing else people would just stop coming here v rude came here to take advantage of their bogo deal for veterans day the food was good it usually is always consistent in my book but we decided to get a couple of their margaritas to try as well ive never ordered a drink from chipotle and i was surprised that they actually whipped out their margarita shaker and actually made the drink right then and there i was half expecting something to come out in a box the drinks were only ok they tasted watered down to me but it was nice to have with our burrito bowls hm tried it again here they seemed to have fixed their issues with the guac portion still varies from no seriously where is the meat to eh thats two meals i tip on the later the food is good but compared to other chipotle places ive been they give you really small portions usually my bowl is packed but there was so much space and they charge for extra when its not even extra disappointed  only reason they are getting a one was because the cashier was the only friendly person there we paid a visit to this chipotle today  we got in and really all the employees looked miserable it was the sloppiest mess of food we have been ever served they didnt drain any of the juices i felt like i was in a mess hall where they slap your food down and you move on we finally got to the cashier and he was the only one smiling and friendly after i paid i asked for lemons and they said they will get someone to cut up some lemons because they were all out we asked again about  minutes later and still no lemons i gave up on my lemon slices as my husband and i are our food we noticed the rice was way undercooked i literally started picking on my food to so i wouldnt have to cook the undercooked rice my husband was a sport and ate it because they already messed up ok his burrito once probably wont be going back to this chipotle location ill try the stanford shopping center one next time i always pass by this particular chipotle on the way to my regular doctor visits was here once by my self and there was nothing noteworthy about it it hasnt been until today with my dad that i noticed the great service that they provide there are about  kinds of meats including chicken beef or pork there are about  kinds of beans there is cheese corn rice brown rice and salsa during this trip i ordered the burrito with brown rice pinto beans chicken mild salsa cheese and corn i shared this huge burrito with one other person and that portion size was more than enough i will be back again  stars because the service and food was good just wish the facility was cleaner and there were more bathrooms i went to get a taco at this chipotle before it closed when i finished getting this taco asking for extra of ingredients some guy i assume the manager proceeded to jump in and insist that he was suddenly going to charge me for a bowl yes thats right chipotle the prices change at chipotle depending on whos ordering at the end my taco is now a bowl i can get extra with anything else burritos bowlsexcept on tacos seriously i have never heard anyone tell me this at any chipotle ever he insisted since it didnt fit on a tortilla i need to pay more this is a new criteria and i need to be the person to make sure this doesnt happen who does that singling me out and insisting that i pay more because you know he feels like it thats really messed up do you really need to read yelp to find the manager is a jerk or portions are skimpy we were unfortunate enough to happen to be nearby this location for lunch so stopped by with no thoughts but found they had no vegetable mix left at all and didnt even have any in the queue thats fine but the annoying part was they didnt even seem apologetic for it and were joking that it was gonna take another hour to be ready when i asked how long it was gonna take um what most skimpy a burrito bowl i have ever gotten at a chipotles i go to this chipotle several times a month the quality is always consistent no matter which location i visit but the staff at this one in particular are extra friendly and efficient love love love chipotle i have no idea whats been happening here recently that merits reviews prior to this but i can say that when i was there the portions were generous the food was great and the service was quick what more than you ask for from a fast food chain i ate here frequently over the summer and always felt full and healthy afterwards terrible service my friend was getting a kids meal and they burnt his quesidilla  times also the person taking my order was really mean i love chipotle and rarely do i not eat what they give me whether it be salty meat or super chunky guac but uncooked rice is where i draw my line how do you mess up rice terrible attitude here employees seem miserable terrible portions i hope you like the taste of sour cream customers are just as rude and out of it ive had a bad experience every single time i have been to this location but somehow hope it will improve when i drop in every  months do not come here cars are getting baseball bats to windows of cars daily  cars today chipotle knows that this happens daily for the last  years my uncles car was smashed today police are here now we ordered here for our group at work like more than  orders and they dont even give us any extra salsa and chips then when we got our orders and open it our orders is all messed up some had salsa and beans although they put on the order sheet what they want is like they just guessing what to put in our order bowl while my other co workers order a burrito bowl but they give them a burrito wrap what a big messed chipotle here is really had a poor service although we ordered ahead of time they should have enough time to prepare it worst chipotle experience ever poor service no lettuce no one at cashier manager was a jerk i would avoid this location this is place is on point ive been here several times and the quality cleanliness and speed has been superb will keep coming back chipotle mexican grill claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more

sofritas if im not feelin meat seasonings on point brown rice of course soft here which is great pinto beans with some salsa and lettuce i get their veggies even if theyre always burnt they seem to pack the bowls less and less with every visit contrary to popular opinion i do like to eat it may actually be that they anticipate me getting more options later on but picky as i am i only favor a few of them tip order using their website for larger portions so they can give you more of what you like i dont like this place we came here maybe  months ago didnt like it then ate here again maybe  days ago and my opinion hasnt changed but if anyone there cares ill explain exactly why  because i dont come here often enough i just want to order for example a chicken taco well there is no such thing you have to tell them what tortilla you want what beans you want etc etc etc fail i think they should have a default set of ingredients for a chicken taco for a beef burrito etc sometimes im not interested in choosing each and every ingredient yes customization is a great thing but if im there with my wife and  kids i dont necessarily want to take  minutes out of my life to choose all the ingredients for everything we want  we found out this the hard way you get a burrito with all the ingredients well they put all  salsas on it and the thing was too spicy for my daughter duh if i want everything on my burrito you should at least ask what spiciness of salsa to use  speaking of salsa every other mexican restaurant we go to has the salsas out for the public to choose themselves but not here here you have to go up the the counter and ask fail quit being so cheap with your salsa and have it easily available to your customers  last one when this place gets crowded and im talking to a person  feet away i cant hear what theyre saying why because the inside of this place is all hard surfaces with no carpeting drapes etc reverbecho city cant hear who youre talking to  bonus item the last time we were here we got  burritos i think  tacos and  sodas for  people no chips how cheap is this place similarly every other mexican place we go to gives us chips sort of like a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your food not here not at least the last time we were there  i believe we came here on a weekday lunch time there were very few people got a parking spot right outside chipotle service is quick i ordered burrito bowl with tofu i love burrito bowl but hate it when they dont have any lemons available  they have variety of sauces to top your bowl with but that doesnt really take the place of what a lemon can do to my taste buds d this is one of the better chipotles  there is plenty of seating and its clean food was fresh and service was quick the employees were by far the friendliest ive seen at any chipotle and the quality of food was better than ive gotten at other locations recently too the people in front of me were asking for extra of almost everything and the servers didnt bat an eyelash not the best news for corporate but if double meatetc is your thing this is your place i ordered a veggi bowl and there is nothing hard or crunchy i should have in my veggi bowl i ordered to go since i was on lunch break and then while eating i found this in my mouth wth is this  stars for the awesome flamboyant guy who was serving me i just got a bowl as i was desperately hungry and it was the only gluten free food in my route im not a fan of fast food so this is my first and last time here the chicken was a little fatty and i asked for salt and pepper and see photo they gave me  containers of the stuff maybe a months supply of salt and pepper how wasteful the place tables could have been wiped down but i didnt eat in so it didnt bother me just wanted to review due to the strange salt and pepper request couldnt they just sprinkle it in for me instead of giving me  containers of it i refused it and they warned me if i didnt take it they would throw it out now im going to try to recycle it into a shaker for my kid or something lol no brown rice or grilled veggies at pm today wont come back around this time again they also kicked my kids and i because her shift ends at pm thats not my problem thats your works problem i should be able to eat where i order my food right so my kids and i hadda eat outside in the cold thanks chipotle was craving a burrito bowl and my meal hit the spot i think chipotle for the most part is pretty consistent and my food always comes out the way i expect it to i would normally give a chain restaurant three stars for meeting expectations but this place gets one extra because of two things it was clean and the service was better than at other chipotle establishments ive been to the girl coming around to sweep the floor was asking the people dining if they needed anything else and even offered to clear our plates away if she saw we were done and the guy that made my bowl was actually able to joke around with me versus acting like he hated his life like ive seen from some other workers this is a great chipotle i just moved out to the bay area and have been here a couple times and both experiences have been great the first time what stood out to me was how a member of team went around to each table asking how their food was and if he could doget anything for them this is above and beyond for a fast food chain and it really makes a difference the second time i was struck by how quickly the assembly line worked behind the counter for my bowl in many chipotle locations there have been multiple people behind the counter and yet they seem to take as long as if only one person had been working on orders this place is like a welloiled machine and it shows definitely going to be a repeat customer especially because of the chipotopia rewards this location always fails and disappoints for several reasons rice is always hard undercooked how hard is it to mess up rice portions are small i asked for two scoops of corn which is pretty much equivalent to one normal scoop of corn at other chipotles workers have no incentive to helping their customers always joking aroundtalking to each other fajitas are burntsoggy arent bell peppers suppose to have a crunch factor to it meh could definitely use some improvements a lot actually i love chipotle but this ones just not great their chips are always lacking in flavor and this visit they forgot my guacamole whuuuuut thats the best part its unforgiving so ill be holding a grudge from now on i might be back just because its close to my work i took a regular salad bowl because of the burnt fajita my whole bowl tasted awful employees here at this chipotle not even bothered to change the fajita awful experience i go here at least once or twice a month and they havent failed me yet in terms of taste the portion really dictates on the employee whos scooping the ingredients its always a hit or miss i guess its like panda some employees are generous and not stingy came here the other night no guac the rice was uncooked and hard and the servers were giving small portions i had to keep asking them to add a little more i love chipotle in general but this place doesnt make me want to go back to this location typical chipotle experience come here get some grub and come back again because its cheap and good i didnt get ecoli so me and chipotle are still on good terms i went to this location for the first time i ordered a chicken burrito seems simple enough when i got home and began to eat itsomething did taste funny i think it was the rice it it tasted a bit sour but like a moron i still ate it  hours pass by and now i feel sick to my stomach to the point that i feel like i will need to vomit to make myself feel betterugh never going to this location again grumpy employees who act like robots very different from most other chipotle locations ive been to out of fajitas before dinner time no lemons worst chipotle experience ive had food is fine by chipotle standards but customer service is sorely lacking my family had an online togo order and they forgot the chips not worth going back over so we called and asked them to refund us for the chips we were told we would have to come back tonight at  pm in the alwaysinsane cherry orchard plaza if we wanted a refund ive worked food service so i know how easy it is to forget something but we should not have to return to the restaurant to fix their mistake update my mother went in the following day and the manager apologized and processed her refund adjusting from one star to two since this isnt the first time items have been left out of our order i had a long day at work and decided to stop at chipotle on my was home to eat away the stress the line was long because the staff was slow and inexperienced after waiting in the long line with no cell service i got to the front and began my order steak burrito with black beans white rice corn hot salsa lettuce guacamole and a little cheese im not knocking the food the food was delicious as always but the staff did everything could to ruin it as i reached the end of the line i realized that the burrito was doomed as i watched an inexperienced burrito wrapper destroy my dreams he botched the wrap job  times before a more experienced employee had to step in and then it only got worse she brought a new tortilla in and dumped the contents into it then she threw away the old tortilla which was coated with the  trump taxed guacamole that i paid for as well as other ingredients finally i received my half sized burrito as i left chipotle more stressed than i entered we im out just came in to get something to eat alex is the most friendliest person ive ever meet made me feel really welcome best costumer service ive ever had alex chipotle mexican grill claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a

charge including rice beans four types of salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce when asked in  about expanding the menu steve ells said its important to keep the menu focused because if you just do a few things you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else chipotle also offers a childrens menu most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks the majority of food is prepared in each restaurant some exceptions are the beans and carnitas which are prepared at a central kitchen in chicago illinois none of the restaurants have freezers microwave ovens or can openers chicken burrito bowl the chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the washington dc metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction

selected locations in the kansas city area some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the proteins relatively high sodium content since a ounce serving contains  calories and  milligrams of sodium while the american heart association’s recommended daily amount is less than  milligrams of sodium in contrast the protein options with next highest sodium contents are barbacoa with  milligrams and sofritas with  milligrams an earlier version on the mexican sausage was tested in denver and new york city in  but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was

all items other than the meats cheese sour cream and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan as of late  chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and veganfriendly the cheese is processed with vegetablebased rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians in april  chipotle began testing a vegan garden blend option which is a plantbased meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo at six locations in the us the flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten food sourcingedit in  while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos horrific and began sourcing from openrange pork suppliers this caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos in  chipotle released a mission statement called food with integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors and using pascalization to pretreat food ingredients since the series of foodpoisoning outbreaks in  lowered trust in the

states ontario british columbia and the district of columbia the field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants the field support system includes apprentice team leaders step up from restaurateurs team leaders or area managers team directors and regional directors not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations because chipotle does not franchise all restaurants are corporately owned thus whenever chipotle is in the process of launching a new location the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business the corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well menuedit a chipotle restaurant in

charge including rice beans four types of salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce when asked in  about expanding the menu steve ells said its important to keep the menu focused because if you just do a few things you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else chipotle also offers a childrens menu most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks the majority of food is prepared in each restaurant some exceptions are the beans and carnitas which are prepared at a central kitchen in chicago illinois none of the restaurants have freezers microwave ovens or can openers chicken burrito bowl the chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the washington dc metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction

selected locations in the kansas city area some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the proteins relatively high sodium content since a ounce serving contains  calories and  milligrams of sodium while the american heart association’s recommended daily amount is less than  milligrams of sodium in contrast the protein options with next highest sodium contents are barbacoa with  milligrams and sofritas with  milligrams an earlier version on the mexican sausage was tested in denver and new york city in  but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy as of fall  chorizo is available nationwide chipotle accepts fax orders and in  the company added the ability to order online from their website for both online and fax

the burritos on their list of the  worst foods in america because of their high caloric content and high sodium when a burrito with carnitas rice vegetables cheese guacamole and salsa was compared with a typical big mac the burrito had more fat cholesterol carbohydrates and sodium than the big mac but it also had more protein and fiber the restaurant has also received praise – healthcom

all items other than the meats cheese sour cream and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan as of late  chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and veganfriendly the cheese is processed with vegetablebased rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians in april  chipotle began testing a vegan garden blend option which is a plantbased meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo at six locations in the us the flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten food sourcingedit in  while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos horrific and began sourcing from openrange pork suppliers this caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos in  chipotle released a mission statement called food with integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors and using pascalization to pretreat food ingredients since the series of foodpoisoning outbreaks in  lowered trust in the

while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos

integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been

hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of

products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been

products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future

students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to

and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company

while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos

chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the

wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food

and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of

products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been

apprentice team leaders step up from restaurateurs team leaders or area managers team directors and regional directors not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations because chipotle does

charge including rice beans four types of salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce when asked in  about expanding the menu steve ells said its important to keep the menu focused because if you just do a few things you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else chipotle also offers a childrens menu most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks the majority of food is prepared in each restaurant some exceptions are the beans and carnitas which are prepared at a central kitchen in chicago illinois none of the restaurants have freezers microwave

selected locations in the kansas city area some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the proteins relatively high sodium content since a ounce serving contains  calories and  milligrams of sodium while the american heart association’s recommended daily amount is less than  milligrams of sodium in contrast the protein options with next highest sodium contents are barbacoa

while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos

integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors and using pascalization to pretreat food ingredients since the series of foodpoisoning outbreaks in  lowered trust in the

we’re talking “getting caught cheating on your girlfriend for the second time” bad — you have no reasonable expectation of forgiveness you just have to wait and see if you even care about hanging around anymore at all and cmg stock is rightfully paying a dear priceview photossource mike mozart via flickrchipotle shares are now down more than  since tuesday following a pair of reports that put its yearplus retribution attempts into questioncmg — which already was flailing in the wake of a disappointing fullyear outlook issued in late june — has fully given back all of its rebound gains since bottoming out in the wake of the big e coli scare in  that helped spark its biggest selloffat the moment shares now sit at lows last seen in how chipotle’s snowball started rollingthe damage started on tuesday after several news outlets reported that numerous customers had complained about getting sick at a chipotle location in sterling virginia the illness which later was confirmed as a norovirus outbreak sparked immediate intraday selling in cmg stockchipotle’s trust was already thin following the wide outbreak of e coli in october but also another e coli batch in july as well as norovirus and salmonella outbreaks in the latter half of the year — but was put further into doubt amid a much different health concernover the next couple days reports began to surface about rodents being seen at one of chipotle’s dallasarea locations with diners later producing video of rodents crawling on the floors and walls  top stocks that would survive an apocalypse while chipotle said this was “an extremely isolated and rare incident” continued selling through the end of the week indicates that investors feel otherwisebut the question now becomes one of whether you can ever go long cmg stock again with any confidence the tired ol’ adage “buy when there’s blood in the streets” immediately comes to mind but when it’s a river of plasma … it’s probably worth at least waiting a little bitstill there are a few reasons to at least consider buying chipotle … at some point if not nowmanagementthe first actually came more than half a year back when chipotle ditched is coceo structure and bill ackman was able to push new directors — thick with restaurant experience — on the board the argument then was these directors would help push innovation and ensure that the company toed a healthier line while that latter argument is chipped it’s not broken i want to give this team time to see how they react to chipotle’s first major crisis under their watchone problem chipotle’s insistence on using the freshest most allnatural ingredients involves a more complicated supply chain than many other restaurants and is partly why food sickness might always be an issue“chipotle’s food sourcing is a laudable effort—and it’s what customers want but they’re probably walking a fine line between offering fresh local ingredients and decentralized food preparation and the risk of introducing foodborne pathogens because it is such a complicated food chain” melinda wilkins director of the online master of science in food safety at michigan state university told wired last yearhowever while it’s doubtful the chain will ever look as simple as say mcdonald’s corporation nysemcd the board has been working on solving this complexity now investors need to watch to see how management responds on this frontwillingness to expandchipotle features one of the most limited menus in the fastfood world setting up its buffett line to pump out a couple of products customizable with just a handful of veggies meats and cheese that’s why investors should take heart at the company’s willingness under ackman’s new board members to branch out to new areasread more last year chipotle debuted chorizo — its first menu change since  when the company rolled out tofu sofritas and this summer the reports that the company would add queso to the menu added a dollop of optimism from the analyst campsaid maxim group’s stephen anderson earlier this week“we believe cmg’s queso is differentiated enough to be not only a potential traffic driver in its own right but also take market share from immediate rivals including qdoba”this only can drive customers if they’re willing to forgive chipotle while that seems like a tall order just days removed from two more flareups remember cmg has had numerous foodsafety issues throughout its history and even after the  e coli breakout eventually some customers did return microsoft corporation msft stock is value you can bank on a quick bounce in cmg stockreality check while chipotle is wounded this isn’t a bankruptcy concern and there’s no imminent collapse of the business this week’s events were bad not fatalwith that in mind let’s look at the chartview photoscmg stock chartmorechipotle’s relative strength index rsi indicator is at its lowest readings since early  when the dip in cmg stock was reaching its end sellers eventually became exhausted and what followed was an oversold bounce of roughly that’s not an argument for a longterm buy here but there’s a powerful case for trading bullish options for a quick profit cmg stock hasn’t managed to go any higher than it did after this technical bounce — and that’s despite a couple quarters’ worth of earnings reports that showed a clear signs of fundamental improvementand what about buyandhold investorschipotle has broken trust for the umpteenth time and more food sickness outbreaks are simply going to happen if not tomorrow then next month or next year that’s the risk chipotle takes for the experience it’s trying to deliver to its customersthe first step comes after the bell tuesday july  when chipotle reports its quarterly earnings when we get both an idea of where the restaurant was before this flareup and potentially some guidance for the current quarter which likely will be affected by this week’s events if we don’t receive any guidance then it’s a waiting game of absorbing industry reports and any tidbits that cmg decides to dole out over the next three months until its q report — when we’re certain to find out just how bad the damage wasin short cmg stock isn’t a safe longterm play for at least another few months but if you’re aggressive and quick on the trading front you might be able to squeeze out some profits on the long

improvements in traffic revenue and profits jason hall tmfvelvethammer apr   at am chipotle mexican grill inc nysecmg reported firstquarter financial and operating results on april  delivering improvements in just about every operating and financial metric and not only as compared to the yearago quarter chipotle improved its business results across the board on a sequential basis as well  in short this seems like a real bounceback quarter driven in no small part by a big increase in customers coming back after more than a year of declining samerestaurant sales lets take a peek at how much better chipotles results were to start   image source chipotle mexican grill a closer look at the financial results heres a comparison between the yearago period and the first quarter metricq q  yearoveryear change revenue    net income    na earnings per share   na comps   na revenue and net income in millions data source chipotle as you can see a big  increase in sales at restaurants open at least  months comps played a significant role in driving revenue  higher versus last year while also helping chipotle deliver its biggest quarterly profit since   more importantly its not just the yearoveryear comparison thats much improved the company continues to deliver on its recent trend of sequential sales recovery heres a comparison to the fourth quarter of  metricq q  change sequential revenue    net income     earnings per share    comps   na revenue and net income in millions data source chipotle chipotle was able to drive a significant amount of its sequential revenue increase to the bottom line both as a product of operating leverage as well as some gains in efficiency in the quarter  key metrics that chipotle improved on a significant part of the companys profit recovery in the quarter was simply a product of higher sales since a major portion of its cost structure is relatively fixed such as property leases and other occupancy expenses the company has also maintained high levels of staffing throughout the past several quarters prioritizing fast highquality service over cutting costs to meet shortterm profit goals potentially to the detriment of the customer experience  chipotle was able to spread those costs out over a much bigger revenue number this quarter  as a result the following operating metrics improved food and packaging expense was  of sales a basispoint improvement sequentially  labor was  of sales a basispoint improvement sequentially  occupancy and other operating costs were  of sales a basispoint improvement sequentially  these along with sales growth improved restaurantlevel operating margin to  up from  year over year and  sequentially  finally this improved cash flows to a great extent cash from operations was  million more than double the  million from the yearago quarter  still work to do but solid progress on regaining customers  its clear that chipotle has made huge strides with its customers as this quarters big comps growth showed but traffic and revenue per store is still down from peak levels the company said that the average chipotle generated  million in sales in the quarter a level still far below the  millionplus peak before the e coli scare  as founder ceo and chairman steve ells said about the companys progress so far by simplifying the focus in our restaurants to only those elements that lead to a great guest experience our operations have improved every single month which gives us confidence that we are on our way to achieve our mission to ensure that great food made with whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone chipotle also opened  new restaurants in the quarter finishing with  after closing all shophouse locations and one chipotle thats  more than it had open at the end of the first quarter in  ells also said that the company would start testing its firstever dessert item  bunuelos  in the near future a popular mexican pastry that requires the addition of only a couple of new ingredients at each restaurant  looking ahead even with a solid bounceback quarter under its belt management continues to provide only very general guidance with expectations for comps growth in the high single digits and plans to open  new restaurants   if customers continue to come back at the pace we have seen since december the company has a good shot at doing better than just highsingledigit comps if that turns out to be the case shareholders will have reason to celebrate  maybe with a margarita and a plate of bunuelos at their neighborhood chipotle  jason hall owns shares

states ontario british columbia and the district of columbia the field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants the field support system includes apprentice team leaders step up from restaurateurs team leaders or area managers team directors and regional directors not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations because chipotle does not franchise all restaurants are corporately owned thus whenever chipotle is in the process of launching a new location the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business the corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well menuedit a chipotle restaurant in brandon florida having the typical serviceline layout with menu above chipotles menu consists of four items burritos bowls tacos and salads the price of each item is based on the choice of chicken pork carnitas barbacoa steak tofubased sofritas chorizo chicken and pork or vegetarian with guacamole which would be at an extra charge otherwise additional optional toppings are offered free of charge including rice beans four types of salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce when asked in  about expanding the menu steve ells said its important to keep the menu focused because if you just do a few things you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else chipotle also offers a childrens menu most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks the majority of food is prepared in each restaurant some exceptions are the beans and carnitas which are prepared at a central kitchen in chicago illinois none of the restaurants have freezers microwave ovens or can openers chicken burrito bowl the chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the washington dc metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction starting in  selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup which has since been discontinued in june  chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizotype sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the kansas city area some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the proteins relatively high sodium content since a ounce serving contains  calories and  milligrams of sodium while the american heart association’s recommended daily amount is less than  milligrams of sodium in contrast the protein options with next highest sodium contents are barbacoa with  milligrams and sofritas with  milligrams an earlier version on the mexican sausage was tested in denver and new york city in  but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy as of fall  chorizo is available nationwide chipotle accepts fax orders and in  the company added the ability to order online from their website for both online and fax

the burritos on their list of the  worst foods in america because of their high caloric content and high sodium when a burrito with carnitas rice vegetables cheese guacamole and salsa was compared with a typical big mac the burrito had more fat cholesterol carbohydrates and sodium than the big mac but it also had more protein and fiber the restaurant has also received praise – healthcom included the restaurant in its list of the healthiest fast food restaurants chipotles vegetarian options include rice black beans fajita vegetables onions and bell peppers salsa guacamole and cheese all items other than the meats cheese sour cream and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan as of late  chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and veganfriendly the cheese is processed with vegetablebased rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians in april  chipotle began testing a vegan garden blend option which is a plantbased meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo at six locations in the us the flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten food sourcingedit in  while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos horrific and began sourcing from openrange pork suppliers this caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos in  chipotle released a mission statement called food with integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health

an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos horrific and began sourcing from openrange pork suppliers this caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos in  chipotle released a mission statement called food with integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the

campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors and

specific restaurants the field support system includes apprentice team leaders step up from restaurateurs team leaders or area managers team directors and regional directors not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations because chipotle does not franchise all restaurants are corporately owned thus whenever chipotle is in the process of launching a new location the field team hires a

additional optional toppings are offered free of charge including rice beans four types of salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce when asked in  about expanding the menu steve ells said its important to keep the menu focused because if you just do a few things you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else chipotle also offers a childrens menu most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks the majority of food is prepared in each restaurant some exceptions are the beans and carnitas which are prepared at a central kitchen in chicago illinois none of the restaurants have freezers microwave ovens or can openers chicken burrito bowl the chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the washington dc metropolitan area but decided

chorizotype sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the kansas city area some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the proteins relatively high sodium content since a ounce serving contains  calories and  milligrams of sodium while the american heart association’s recommended daily amount is less than  milligrams of sodium in contrast the protein options with next highest sodium contents are barbacoa with  milligrams and sofritas with  milligrams an earlier version on the mexican sausage was tested in denver and new york city in  but that test

vegetables onions and bell peppers salsa guacamole and cheese all items other than the meats cheese sour cream and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan as of late  chipotle developed a new cooking

chipotle began testing a vegan garden blend option which is a plantbased meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo at six locations in the us the flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten food sourcingedit in  while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas steve ells was prompted by an article written by edward behr to visit concentrated animal feeding operations cafos ells found the cafos horrific and began sourcing from openrange pork suppliers this caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos in  chipotle released a mission statement called food with integrity which highlighted chipotles efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat organic produce and dairy without added hormones chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens the breast meat is sold to panera bread customers at a chipotle restaurant in fredericksburg virginia founder steve ells has testified before the united states congress in support of the preservation of antibiotics for medical treatment act which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals since  the coalition of immokalee workers ciw a floridian farmworker organization has protested chipotle’s refusal to sign a fair food agreement which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a pennyperpound premium on its florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages and to only buy florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the fair food code of conduct in  the creators of the documentary film food inc along with  other leaders in the sustainable food movement signed an open letter of support for the ciw’s campaign stating that “if chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain the time has come to work with the coalition of immokalee workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights” in september  chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the ciw and instead work directly with east coast growers and packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers ceo steve ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control stating that “the ciw wants us to sign a contract that would let them control chipotles decisions regarding food in the future in october  chipotle mexican grill signed an agreement with the ciw and became the th company to join the organizations fair food program in january  chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers found during a regular audit as the reason subsequently a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease muslims who consider pork to be unclean leading to some protests on social media the company still uses antibioticfree and hormonefree steak in its restaurants despite being briefly forced to serve beef that is not naturally raised during the summer of  posting an instore notice each time that occurred roberto ferdman of the washington post opined that chipotles stated mission to sell food with integrity may be untenable if meat producers continue to breach chipotles ethical standards also in  chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely gmo free this was done in response to increasing consumer demand for gmo free products food safetyedit external video how chipotle made hundreds of people barf vox report dated january   explaining chipotles food safety crisis since  a former kansas state university food safety professor has accused chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as naturally raised meats organic ingredients and locally sourced and trying to equate those terms with food safety in rebuttal a chipotle spokesperson told the daily beast that all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms its important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms yet fivethirtyeight pointed out that the  norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices marketwatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial foodsafety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores both of which are industrystandard practices that the company had previously criticized the new york times implied that the companys insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about food integrity seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems it also has been pointed out that chipotles current recordkeeping system is actually hindering the health authorities investigation in locating the sources of the various infections a writer for the magazine popular science pointed out that chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation henry i miller a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the fdas office of biotechnology asked one wonders whether chipotle’s traditional methods include employees neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food which is how norovirus is usually spread and the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snowjob freezing e colicontaminated food does not kill the pathogens it preserves them describing food poisoning outbreaks as something of a chipotle trademark the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year  one of which was not disclosed to the public miller notes that a particularly worrisome aspect of the companys serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – salmonella and e coli bacteria and norovirus in other words there has been more than a single glitch suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what chipotle cavalierly sells at premium prices to its customers a writer for the north carolina newspaper the news  observer called chipotles food with integrity a lucrative farce and a marketing ploy by pointing out that organic food is often grown with manure an allnatural fertilizer which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like e coli in december  seattle health officials closed a seattlearea chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order on december   ceo steve ells released a press statement apologizing for  outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks march  hepatitis outbreakedit in march and april  the community epidemiology branch of the san diego county health and human services agency traced a hepatitis a outbreak in san diego county to a single chipotle restaurant located in la mesa california in which  customers were infected with the virus april  norovirus outbreakedit in  chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in kent ohio where over  people became ill after eating at a chipotle restaurant officials at the ohio department of health said that the outbreak was caused by norovirus genotype g many of the victims were students at kent state university the initial source of the outbreak was never found february  campylobacter jejuni outbreakedit in  an investigation by the minnesota department of health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a chipotle mexican grill in apple valley minnesota the investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been crosscontaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreakthirdparty source needed july  e coli outbreakedit in early november  the oregonian reported that there was a littleknown e coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in july in which five persons were infected with the oh strain of e coli the outbreak was traced to a single chipotle location in seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with chipotle health officials were unable to trace the source of the july outbreak and said that the cause of the july outbreak is unrelated to the octobernovember outbreak august  norovirus outbreakedit another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in august  at a simi valley california location in which  customers and  employees reported becoming ill ventura county health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report despite those violations the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate in a january  article the new york times reported that the number of victims involved in the simi valley norovirus outbreak was actually  twice the number that was reported earlier in an unusual move the us attorneys office for the central district of california in conjunction with the food and drug administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in january  as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from chipotle concerning the simi valley norovirus outbreak as of january update it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation in most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location state andor local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases however ventura county officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections less than two weeks later a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the central district of california claiming that chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home then the restaurant actively deepcleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the ventura county environmental health division of the existing outbreak hindering their investigation the lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as  and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high  august  salmonella outbreakedit at almost the same time as the simi valley norovirus outbreak minnesota health officials confirmed a salmonella outbreak that affected  minneapolisarea chipotle restaurants in midaugust  the source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in mexico the minnesota department of health reported that samples from  victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the salmonella newport bacterium as determined by dna profiling later the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to  and the number chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to  all located within the state of minnesota october  e coli outbreakedit in october  at least  persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different chipotle locations in the states of washington and oregon at that time an epidemiologist for the washington health department said the culprit appeared to be a shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli bacterium but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result as a precaution chipotle had closed  stores in washington and oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities on november  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to  known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from  infected persons in washington and  persons in oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of e coli the shiga toxinproducing stec o strain as determined by dna profiling at least  persons required hospitalization but no fatalities as of november  health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination but suspected fresh produce on november  the cdc increased the number of known cases to  the number of persons requiring hospitalization to  and the number of dna fingerprint confirmations to  through a match via pulsenet the dna fingerprint also matched a recent case in minnesota but the ill person did not eat at chipotle the source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the cdc and the cdc is trying to use the more definitive but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the stec o cases in the meantime chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on november  after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities on november  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six besides oregon and washington new cases were reported in the states of minnesota california new york and ohio  out of  of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a chipotle in the week before they had become sick on december  the cdc reported that the number of stec o cases as determined by dna fingerprinting had increased to  with  persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine new cases were reported in the states of california  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington  the price of shares for chipotle stock dropped a further  immediately after the cdc had issued their update on november  share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the e coli outbreak in late october with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the cdc and fda on february   the cdc official closed their investigations on the larger e coli that started in pacific northwest in october  and also the smaller outbreak that started in kansas and oklahoma in november since no new cases were reported since december  in their final report the cdc stated that  persons in  states were infected with the same strain of stec o during the major outbreak with  of those persons requiring hospitalization the five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of stec o the cdc also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain the cdc fda and the usda food safety and inspection service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected november  e coli casesedit the centers for disease control and prevention reported on december  that five more people became ill after eating at two chipotle restaurants located in kansas and oklahoma in late november preliminary dna fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of shiga toxinproducing e coli o scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the e coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in oregon and washington in late october and thus an extension of that outbreak the agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak the food and drug administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases along with the earlier oregon washington and other multistate cases might have been propagated through the food supply chain december  norovirus outbreakedit the closed restaurant on december   in december  eighty students at boston college were sickened after eating at a single chipotle restaurant affected students had been tested for both e coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus the health inspectors for the city of boston had since closed this particular location on december  for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection on december  officials from the boston public health commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak boston globe reported on december  that  persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited chipotle before contracting the virus and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at chipotle such as a roommate or dormmate boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes consequencesedit on february   chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an allstaff meeting on food safety the company hired a new head of food safety who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour having two employees verify that produce like onions jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors and using pascalization to pretreat food
