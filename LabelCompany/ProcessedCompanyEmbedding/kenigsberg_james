teams at thomson financial and ogilvy  mathers james kenigsberg what does entrepreneurship mean to you and what underlying characteristics do you see in successful entrepreneurs james passion combined with fearlessness are key traits of an entrepreneur start with passion  the contagious passion is what gets people to buy into and support your ideas from there you have to have no fear entrepreneurship is believing that you and a few close friends are the best people to execute on whatever it is youre passionate about you will meet people who will tell you that your ideas wont work or that they can do it better but you have to stand your ground and have no fear if you are the best you will make it happen between the hard work and the wearing of many hats having passion and fearlessness will carry you through the stresses of being an entrepreneur and will ultimately drive you toward success what are you most proud of in your professional career if you could do something over in your life what would it be james my biggest accomplishment has been building a team that is constantly innovating at u being able to bring together the right people choose and create the right technologies and manage the team so they all work well together has helped us achieve the breadth of technology we are able to offer to our university partners and their students if i had to do it all over again i wouldnt have wasted so much time looking for jobs that fit my skillset i should have been looking for jobs that inspired me i didnt have passion for the company mission in my previous jobs they were good jobs and they provided me with necessary skills but at u our work is changing the world were helping nonprofit universities expand educational access to students worldwide in fields including social work and business analytics and that is something im truly passionate about tell me about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goal james when we started u building platforms on cloud technologies like salesforce amazon web services and other softwareasaservice providers wasnt yet a popular business practice but we knew that was how we wanted to build u today its a no brainer everyone is in the cloud but back in  we heard a lot of doubters say real businesses dont do things like that they dont hire saas companies we took a leap at u and did it anyway and its been one of our best business decisionswhat is one piece of advice you would give to fellow experienced entrepreneurs to keep in mind as their business growsjames continual learning is an integral part of every position in business experienced entrepreneurs and managers need to keep expanding their knowledge base and looking to only senior staff shouldnt be the way its time to flip the script look to your junior staff for mentorship and training by tapping into their skillsets and interests spending time with those in the trenches on a daytoday basis can teach you a great deal and will help you evolve as a leader youll gain new perspective that will allow you to become a better manager and be able to more deeply understand how your employees work on a daytoday basis where do you draw inspiration from james i like watching how younger generations are doing things and learning what theyre passionate about its fascinating to me how serious my kids viktor and daniel get about computer games and coding through things like minecraft being in the education industry im also drawn to understanding where and how younger generations are learning i want to be on the forefront of anticipating those trends and to develop new ways of thinking i never want to be too old to be able to connect with them and be able to discover new things if you were to give advice to your  yearold self what would it be james seek out mentors dont spend your time concentrating on making money or searching for jobs search for mentors to help you succeed personally and professionally i wish i would have found my mentors much earlier in life they put me on the right path for my career and helped me become successful look for mentors outside of your office at events
