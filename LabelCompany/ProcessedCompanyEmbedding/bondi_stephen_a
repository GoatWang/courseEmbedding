reviews its great       by timharrison i love reading about apple history this book tells the story around the time of mac os x coming into existence and the birth of the imac as well as events surrounding that time i thought i knew everything about those days at apple already but boy was i wrong stephen has such a wealth of knowledge and he conveys it so well in this book and for only  theres really no reason not to get this book seriously get it now delightful trip down translucent memory lane       by jeff hobbs really enjoyed this wellwritten wellillustrated book this era represents a really dramatic and fascinating time in apples history and most people have forgotten this time by now interesting but not a lot there       by gadgetcoma maybe its because i already knew a fair amount about apple history but i didnt find this book to provide a lot of detail it was interesting to hear about the imac and the evolution of mac models i found the discussion about mac os x and its origins in nextstep to be pretty light on detail the book also seemed disjointed and hard to connect bondi to apple in the way the author suggests customers also bought os x  yosemite the ars
