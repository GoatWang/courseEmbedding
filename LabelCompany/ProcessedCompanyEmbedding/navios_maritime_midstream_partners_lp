acquisition nap’s parent navios maritime acquisition nap’s parent owns a large fleet of modern crude oil refined petroleum product and chemical tankers providing worldwide marine transportation services and has a market capitalization of approximately  million as of september   navios maritime acquisition’s strategy is to charter its vessels to international oil companies refiners and large vessel operators under long medium and shortterm charters navios maritime acquisition is committed to providing quality transportation services and developing and maintaining longterm relationships with its customers nap intends to use navios maritime holdings’ and navios maritime acquisition’s extensive experience and relationships to secure longterm time charters for its vessels competition the market for international seaborne crude oil transportation services is fragmented and highly competitive seaborne crude oil transportation services generally are provided by two main types of operators major oil company captive fleets both private and stateowned and independent ship owner fleets in addition several owners and operators pool their vessels together on an ongoing basis and such pools are available to customers to the same extent as independently owned and operated fleets many major oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and use such vessels not only to transport their own crude oil but also to transport crude oil for third party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market competition for charters is intense and is based upon price location size age condition and acceptability of the vessel and its manager due in part to the fragmented tanker market competitors with greater resources could enter the tanker market and operate larger fleets through acquisitions or consolidations and may be willing or able to accept lower prices than us which could result in nap’s achieving lower revenues from its vessels  shareholders postipo navios maritime acquisition    dividends the amount of the minimum quarterly distribution is  per unit or  per unit per year or  at the

have rate backstops or minimum rates with profit sharing mechanisms that are calculated on an annualized basis at this juncture the probability that nap will only realize the base rates under the various charters and rate backstops during the next  months profit sharing is calculated on an annualized basis has increased with the extension of the production cuts q  revenue approximated the average annualized daily base minimum rate on page  of the q  earnings presentation and resulted in a distribution coverage ratio of x rounded up per page  of the earnings presentation the coverage ratio will weaken slightly during  due to the increase in outstanding common units nap will generate little to no free cash during the remainder of  and it will need to fund any additional cash collateral amounts due under the term loan b credit facility with cash on hand or proceeds from the continuous offering of common units valuation adjustments there were several sales of comparably aged tankers in secondary market during the last several weeks these sales are listed below these comparables resulted in a downward revision in the fmv of naps fleet a valuation that was pretty dire

reduction in the estimate it should be noted that the vessel sales used as comparables are slightly larger than naps vessels of comparable vintage an adjustment for this difference would further reduce the estimate of fmv the reduced fleet fmv based on recent comparable sales indicates that nap will fail the  ltv covenant test again in the term b loan credit facility during the second and third quarters based on the updated fleet fmv estimate provided above it is likely that the company will need to add an additional  million to the cash collateral account leasing alternatives a comment on my prior article referenced naps statement page  of the q earnings release that it is exploring financing opportunities including sale and leaseback structures with chinese leasing houses sounds impressive right this sa reader thought it was but do not fall for this statement it is abject bunk just like so much of the spin that is liberally larded into almost all of the navios family of companies presentations first leasing is just another form of leverage if properly structured to meet gaap requirements a lease may be classified as an operating lease an operating lease is still leverage it will be disclosed in the financial footnotes and any rating agency or sophisticated debt investor will factor it in when analyzing the creditworthiness of the company if the lease does not meet gaap operating lease requirements it will be capitalized on the balance sheet as debt with a related asset since the gaap conclusion is that it has not really been sold only financed second an operating lease or a capital lease would worsen naps current cash flows the current debt requires a  per annum principal payment until maturity this is a very advantageous deal for a very poor credit an operating lease to qualify as such would require a much higher principal payment remember a lease payment represents principal interest and an equity return the counterparty in a sale leaseback will want a return on its equity that is reflective of the lessee and asset risk the cash flows will worsen because the principal payments will need to be higher and the cost of capital will be higher that pesky equity return third the assets that would be the subject of the purported sale leaseback already secure the existing term loan b credit facility the reader commenting on the lease rumor was under the mistaken impression that the proceeds would go to nap nonsense nap would need to secure a release of the assets from the term loan b creditors the term loan b creditors therefore have the leverage and would agree to such a deal only if it improves their credit position basic rule of finance when you have to ask for permission you are in the weaker negotiating position lastly chinese financial institutions are all tied to the central government either through outright ownership regulation or behindthescenes political control their primary focus is to finance the growth and expansion of the chinese economy not to fund the rescue of an overlevered greek shipping company conclusion my conclusions are the same as in my last article which i will repeat verbatim run to the exits now november may seem far away and the temptation to capture a couple of meaty quarterly common unit distributions is great but the market will begin to understand this issue over the next

common unit distribution cut is likely after the subordinated units subordination period expires subsequent to payment of the minimum distribution for the quarter ended september  there was a recent article published on sa recommending navios maritime midstream partners lp nysenap as an attractive high yielding dividend investment vehicle ignore this advice and sell nap now nap failed the  to  loantovalue covenant test contained in section  nysea of the term loan b credit facility credit facility for the quarter ended march st  and under the terms of section  of the credit facility it was obligated to fund  million into a cash collateral account to cure the covenant test failure this is surreptitiously disclosed in footnote  of the q  financial statements included in the k filed april th it is laughably and disingenuously described as strengthening collateral of term loan b on page  of the q  earnings presentation earnings presentation and then hidden in footnote  on page  of the earnings presentation angeliki frangou has a history of glossing over these types of financial issues a  to  ltv covenant test is extremely lenient from the borrowers perspective failing such a lenient ltv covenant test is therefore a big red warning flag for dividend investors it clearly communicates that nap is woefully overleveraged in comparison with its underlying assets and that it will not be able to maintain common unit distributions at the current level of unit beyond the expiration of the subordinated units subordination period see below for more detail nap owns six vlccs and as detailed in the table below the fmv of the vessels is in the range of  million based on compass maritime value estimates for the week ending may th  navios maritime partners lp age as of

value of  million annual principal payments of  million  per annum of the face value and an unamortized issuance discount of  million is approximately  million  of the estimated  million of fmv from the table above equals approximately  million plus the  million in cash collateral equals about  million based on estimated principal outstanding of  million nap is already in danger of failing the ltv covenant test again at the end of q the value of naps vessels will continue to decline at a rate between  and  per annum during  as the vessels age this decline in value is greater than the  per annum principal payments due under the credit facility so nap may need to fund further contributions to the cash collateral account to cure ltv covenant test failures at the end of the second and third quarters vlccs have a useful life of  years compass maritimes estimate of fmv value for a  year old vlcc is slightly above scrap assuming ldt of between k and k tons and scrap price range of  to  see table below navios maritime midstream partners lp vlcc scrap value calculation value per ton ldt tonnage                compass maritime  yr vlcc est value  in three to four years nap will likely scrap three of its older vlccs and this will have a big deleterious impact on its future cash flows the scrapping of these vessels will coincide with the june  maturity date of the credit facility the lenders are in an increasingly poor position relative to the collateral so they are unlikely to show any flexibility on requirements to cure the ltv covenant test failures nap filed a continuous offering program cop for the issuance of  million in common units during the q of  during q nap issued  million in common units and the ytd issuance increased to  million as of april th per page  of the earnings presentation additional common unit issuance will likely increase now that the exdividend date for the q common units distribution has passed between a rock and a hard place issuing common units to fund cash collateral calls to cure credit facility ltv covenant test failures equals paying down debt with equity under normal circumstances this may be a good idea the problem is that nap is issuing common units that yield  in order to pay down debt costing  this is suicide the cost of capital nearly triples while the useful lives and the value of the underlying assets continue to decline it is unsustainable for instance just the  million in common units issued ytd will require approximately k in incremental distributions per annum at the current common unit distribution rate lets look at it from an enterprise value perspective per page  of the april th k total units outstanding common subordinated and gp equaled  million at fridays closing price of  the equity value of nap is a bit more than  million add the amount due under the credit facility and the enterprise value is north of  million this is more than x the fmv of the assets this is a house of cards about to collapse why is nap still paying such a high distribution why is nap paying such a high common unit distribution in the face of such an existential financial crisis in a word subordination the capital structure of nap was setup with subordinated units to provide the common unit holders with a distribution cushion or shock absorber in case financial performance deteriorated for any reason this was a common marketing device deployed by gps selling interests in lp spinoffs distribution payments on naps subordinated units would only occur if the minimum quarterly distribution amount of  per unit and any arrearages from prior periods had been made to the common units the expiration of this subordination would occur as follows the second business day following the distribution of available cash to partners pursuant to section  in respect of any quarter ending on or after september   in respect of which nysei distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the outstanding common units subordinated units general partner units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units other than subordinated series a units equaled or exceeded the minimum quarterly distribution during each of the three consecutive nonoverlapping fourquarter periods immediately preceding such date and nyseb the adjusted operating surplus for each of the three consecutive non overlapping four quarter periods immediately preceding such date equaled or exceeded the sum of the minimum quarterly distribution on all of the common units subordinated units general partner units and any other units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units that were outstanding during such periods on a fully diluted basis with respect to each such period and ii there are no cumulative common unit arrearages in a nutshell nap has successfully paid the minimum quarterly distribution since the issuance of the common units and in fact increased the distribution to  beginning in q  the subordination period will therefore expire two days after the distribution for the quarter ended september th  if it maintains the current quarterly distribution the q distribution is typically paid the first week of november at the expiration of the subordination period the subordinated units convert to common units navios maritime acquisition corp nysenna as the gp is not going to risk the continued subordination of its units by not paying the next two minimum quarterly distributions the following table details the units outstanding and the projected quarterly and annual distributions on the units navios maritime midstream partners lp units qtrly distributions yearly distributions common units    subordinated series a units    subordinated units    general partner interest    total    nap will likely need to reduce its yearly distributions on all its unit by at least  million in order to free up cash flow sufficient to pay down or cash collateralize its credit facility that would reduce the yearly distributions to approximately  million if the subordinated units remained subordinated the common unit payout would decline by roughly  with the subordinated units converting to common units the common unit payout would drop from  to  this would be a major blow to common unit holders but it would ameliorate the cash flow hit to nna by waiting until after the expiration of the subordination period to cut the common unit distributions nna is placing its interests before the interests of the current common unit holders as detailed in the table above nap has three vlccs that will likely be scrapped within  to  years this will dramatically reduce its future cash flows the best path forward for nap would be to eliminate the distributions entirely this would free up more than  million a year in cash flow which could be used to purchase  year old vlccs satisfy the credit facility collateralization requirements and begin the rejuvenation of the nap fleet this will not occur however because nna is the gp and it needs to continue to maximize its nearterm cash flow conclusion run to the exits now november may seem far away and the temptation to capture a couple of meaty quarterly common unit distributions is great but the market will begin to understand this issue over the next quarter or two and hammer the price down disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it
