incentivize” –peter diamantis founder xprize foundation employees are a company’s most valuable asset but motivating them to perform their best can be challenging to get the most from your employees easy metrics recommends implementing performance based incentives also called “pay for performance” a method in which employees are rewarded for completing their various tasks within a certain amount of time and quality level the key point with employee incentives is to align the incentive for the employee with the goals of the company and be careful of unintended consequences if you incentivize solely for productivity a consequence may be that quality suffers or bottlenecks develop in production if designed properly performance based incentives can dramatically transform an organization’s productivity  employee engagement employees have to believe in the program that it is fair and that it accurately reflects their abilities and effort there is a direct correlation between the employees’ work level and the incentives they earn bonusing production employees on the profit of the company often will not work because many of the factors that affect profitability lay outside of their control  accurate and fair performance targets true employee engagement requires performance incentives the challenge for the company though is knowing how to compile all of their data to build such a program you will need accurate activity based cost accounting and employee performance standards to build a long term profit driven employee incentive program the easy metrics algorithm calculates the standards and performance targets  the selffunded incentive program employee incentive programs that cost money are doomed to failure and we believe increasing your costs defeats the purpose of the program that’s why the easy metrics employee incentive programs are  selffunded through productivity increases new jobs to be created in nyc in the next five years by mediamath the
