financial statements february     note  – organization and business operations   organization and description of business   luboa group inc the “company” formerly known as sunrise tours inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on march   “inception” on january   the company filed a certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of nevada and changed its corporate name to “luboa group inc” concurrent with the change of corporate name the company also changed its principal business plan from developing and offering special services such as d virtual tours for companies which would like to promote their venues on the internet and electronic media to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in asia however as of february   no definitive agreement had been entered into in connection with the business plan the company’s principal headquarters is located in kaohsiung city taiwan from inception through february   the company accumulated losses of approximately    in june  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  “development stage entities” the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the accounting standards codification “asc” thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptionto date information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the amendments in this update are applied retrospectively the adoption of asu  removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the company   note  – going concern   the company has incurred loss since inception resulting in accumulated deficit of approximately  as of february   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business plan accordingly there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties andor the issuance of equity and debt securities   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and are presented in us dollars the company’s fiscal yearend is august  in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year the information included in this quarterly report on form q should be read in conjunction with information included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended august   the “annual report”   cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the accompanying statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents the company’s funds are deposited in insured institutions the funds are insured for up to  at february   the company’s funds did not exceed the insured amount   basic and diluted income loss per share the company computes income loss per share in accordance with fasb asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive          for the three month periods ended february   and february   there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been antidilutive as the company incurred losses in these periods   fair value of financial instruments asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market   these tiers include   level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets   level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and   level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions the carrying value of cash and the company’s loan from a shareholder approximates its fair value due to their shortterm maturity   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to fasb asc  “income taxes” under asc  deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period if any and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   asc  also provides criteria for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under asc  the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority at february   there were no unrecognized tax benefits   revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue in accordance with asc no  “revenue recognition” asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required   advertising costs the company’s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred the company incurred advertising expense of  during six month periods ended february   and february     recent accounting pronouncements management

preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates          stockbased compensation as of february   the company had not issued any stockbased payments to its employees   stockbased compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with asc  when

notes to the unaudited financial statements november     note  – organization and business operations   organization and description of business   luboa group inc the “company” formerly known as sunrise tours inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on march   “inception” and has adopted august  fiscal year end  on january   the company filed a certificate of amendment with the secretary of state of nevada and changed its corporate name to “luboa group inc” concurrent with the change of corporate name the company also changed its principal business plan from developing and offering special services such as d virtual tours for companies which would like to promote their venues on the internet and electronic media to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in asia however as of november   no definitive agreement had been entered into in connection with the business plan the company’s principal headquarters is located in kaohsiung city taiwan  from inception through november   the company accumulated losses of approximately    in june  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  “development stage entities” the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the accounting standards codification “asc” thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the amendments in this update are applied retrospectively the adoption of asu  removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the company   note  – going concern   the company has incurred loss since inception resulting in accumulated deficit of approximately  as of november   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business plan  accordingly there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern     the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties andor the issuance of equity and debt securities     note  – summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and are presented in us dollars the company’s fiscal yearend is august    cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the accompanying statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents the company’s funds are deposited in insured institutions the funds are insured for up to  at november   the company’s funds did not exceed the insured amount   basic and diluted income loss per share the company computes income loss per share in accordance with fasb asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   for the three month periods ended november   and  there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been antidilutive as the company incurred losses in these periods          fair value of financial instruments asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market   these tiers include   level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions   the carrying value of cash and the company’s loan from a shareholder approximates its fair value due to their shortterm maturity   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to fasb asc  “income taxes” under asc  deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period if any and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   asc  also provides criteria for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under asc  the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority at november   there were no unrecognized tax benefits   revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue in accordance with asc no  “revenue recognition” asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required   advertising costs the company’s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred the company incurred advertising expense of  during three month periods ended november   and    recent accounting pronouncements management has reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   stockbased compensation as of november   the company had not issued any stockbased payments to its employees   stockbased compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with asc  when applicable  to date the company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options   note  – common stock   the company has  shares of common stock authorized with a par value of   per share   on september   the company issued  shares at  per share for total proceeds of    for the year ended august   the company issued  shares at  per share for total proceeds of    as at november    shares of common stock were issued and outstanding see note  change of control regarding the january   transaction resulting in the ownership change as of approximately  of these common shares          note  – income taxes   as of november
