defendant represented by matthew v delduca  pepper hamilton llp angelo a stio iii  pepper hamilton llp  james hs levine  pepper hamilton llp memorandum gerald austin mchugh district judge defendants and crossclaimants in this case have asked me to resolve a discovery dispute relating to control of the attorneyclient privilege over communications with the law firm wishart norris wishart norris was engaged for the specific purpose of executing the complex corporate transaction that is the chewy center of this litigation from the record before me it appears that wishart norris had no previous relationship with any of the parties wishart norris crafted many of the documents necessary to effect the transactions that created new utilipath a delaware corporation and transferred control of old utilipath to the newly created entity utilipath through utilipath holdings new utilipath the successor corporation is at odds with baxter hayes jr and utilipath holdings the vehicle created to transfer ownership the baxter parties regarding whether the baxter parties may claim attorneyclient privilege over communications with wishart norris that predate august   there are two sets of documents at issue wishart norris turned over one set of documents to the baxter parties upon their request the second set of documents consists of communications that remained on utilipath servers after the merger and are therefore in new utilipaths possession new utilipath insists that as the survivor company in a merger it owns the privilege over all communications with wishart norris including communications prior to the date that the control of old utilipath passed to new utilipath the baxter parties disagree and maintain that they have the right to assert attorneyclient privilege over communications with wishart norris up to and including august   the other owners of old utilipath jarrod hayes and baxter hayes iii contend that each document must first be reviewed individually to determine whether a privilege exists i discussion resolving this dispute requires first addressing what laws should govern the issue in this case a plaintiff corporation based in pennsylvania but organized under delaware law has brought claims against three florida residents a north carolina company and another corporation based in north carolina but organized under delaware law there is a spiders web of claims crossclaims and counterclaims among these geographically diverse parties that sound in federal delaware and pennsylvania law because this dispute concerns claims of privilege i look to federal rule of evidence  which states that federal privilege laws apply in federal claims and state privilege laws apply in state claims fed r evid  the third circuit explained in pearson v miller  fd   d cir  that when parties have presented both federal and state claims courts should apply federal privilege law the court wrote the problems associated with the application of two separate privilege rules in the same case are readily apparent especially where as here the evidence in dispute is apparently relevant to both the state and the federal claims this court has resolved this potential conflict in favor of federal privilege law  fd at  thus federal privilege law must govern in this case a attorneyclient privilege under federal law the attorneyclient privilege affords the client the right to shield his her or its confidential communications with counsel from other parties see in re teleglobe communications corp  fd   d cir  control over the privilege belongs to the client who may be a natural person or a corporation commodity futures trading comn v weintraub  us   upjohn co v united states  us   since a corporation is not a corporeal being a corporations leadership exercises control over the corporations attorneyclient privilege see weintraub  us at  in general when the corporation changes its leadership the new leaders assume control over the privilege id the question here then is whether the baxter parties somehow retained control of the attorneyclient privilege with respect to communications with wishart norris either as former managers of the predecessor utilipath or as direct clients of the law firm the third circuit has addressed issues of attorneyclient privilege under similar circumstances in in re bevill bresler  schulman asset management corporation  fd  d cir  bevill arose out of a bankruptcy proceeding in new jersey where the debtors trustee sought discovery of the contents of meetings between the debtors officers and their corporate counsel in its disposition of the case the court of appeals concluded that the corporate officers could not assert an individual attorneyclient privilege although it did so primarily on waiver grounds for purposes of this case bevill is instructive in two respects first it held that the party who asserts the existence of attorneyclient privilege has the burden of establishing that the privilege exists  fd at  the court of appeals also endorsed the district courts adoption of a fivepart test for evaluating an assertion of a personal attorneyclient privilege with respect to communications with corporate counsel id at  at least one later decision from this court reads bevill as having adopted that fivepart test as the governing standard in cases such as this in in re sunrise security litigation  frd  ed pa  i am not as certain that the third circuit intended to require the application of such a fiveprong recovery in every case rather than simply holding that it was an appropriate method of analyzing the issue under the facts of that particular case assuming however that such a test applies the individual parties here seeking to invoke the privilege must establish that when they approached counsel they made it clear that they were seeking legal advice in their individual rather than in their representative capacities    and must demonstrate that the counsel saw fit to communicate with them in their individual capacities knowing that a possible conflict could arise  fd at  with these requirements in mind i turn to an analysis of the various assertions of privilege and to the specific precedent outside the third circuit cited by the parties b identifying wishart norris client the baxter parties insist that they retain the right to assert attorneyclient privilege over communications with wishart norris premerger because they were the sellers of a controlling interest in old utilipath in support of this position they analogize the current situation to tekniplex v meyner and landis  ned  ct ap ny  in that case a new york state court applying new york law found that the former sole shareholder and ceo of a corporation retained control over the attorneyclient privilege after a merger and transfer of control but only with respect to communications that related to the negotiation of the merger the court reasoned that the shareholder and ceo was in an adversarial posture towards the company that was absorbing his own and was entitled to confidential communications with his longtime lawyer about the negotiations in contrast new utilipath characterizes wishart norris exclusively as counsel for the corporate entities old and new utilipath new utilipath argues that wishart norris represented baxter jarrod and lindon only as managers of old utilipath consequently according to new utilipath control over wishart norris communications passed to new utilipath after the merger new utilipath analogizes to great hill equity partners iv lp v sig growth equity fund i llp  ad  del chancery ct  in great hill a delaware state court applying delaware law held that a successor corporation took control of the attorneyclient privilege as to all communications between the merged corporation and its attorneys the successor corporations control extended even over communications premerger that related to merger new utilipath asserts that here as in great hill the law firm represented only the corporation and new utilipath should have control over the attorney client privilege as to all communications with wishart norris before and after the merger the most useful point of departure is the contract of representation whereby wishart norris was retained the retention letter stated that it related to this firms representation of utilipath llc the company the letter also cautioned the advice and communications which we render on the companys behalf are not intended to be disseminated to or relied upon by any other parties without our written consent emphasis added the signature line identified utilipath llc and identified jarrod hayes as a manager jarrod hayes did not separately sign as an individual and neither did his father baxter hayes jr or brother baxter hayes iii the baxter parties seize on the reference to wishart norris representing your interests in utilipath in the letters opening paragraph as evidence of a broader representation however that phrase appears in the introduction of the letter and is followed by repeated clear statements that wishart norris was undertaking representation of the company rather than the individual owners or directors in fact the letter was addressed only to jarrod hayes not his father or brother and he accepted the representation in the capacity of a corporate officer in fact there is no ambiguity in the scope of representation set forth in the agreement retaining counsel utilipath was the sole client the baxter parties next look to one of the transaction documents specifically section  of the redemption agreement to argue either that the parties always believed wishart norris represented the baxter parties personally or that the parties agreed through the redemption agreement to give the baxter parties control of the premerger privilege the section states utilipath will deliver or cause to be delivered an amount equal to a the closing consideration minus in addition to several other amounts d the fees and expenses of wishart norris henninger and pittman pa counsel to the seller parties redemption agreement §  it is clear the sections purpose is to deduct costs for the transaction from the payout to jarrod lindon baxter and holdings the suggestion that this one choice of phrase used as a shorthand label in allocating costs was intended to rewrite the retention agreement or transfer potentially important rights defies belief it is not at all clear that this isolated clause given the context and all the other evidence shows wishart norris directly represented baxter lindon jarrod or holdings and it is a leap worthy of an olympian longjumper to argue as the baxter parties do that the clause amounted to consideration for an express agreement by new utilipath ceding the attorneyclient relationship to the seller parties baxter parties reply  the baxter parties read much more into one subordinate clause counsel to the seller parties within this feedistribution section than i am willing to read i also find nothing in wishart norris actions that indicate it was representing any of the baxter parties as individuals in addition to representing the corporations further supporting my conclusion is the fact that baxter jarrod and lindon hayes had retained their own personal counsel i decline to follow tekniplex in giving the baxter parties control over premerger communications the case was decided under new york law see in re hechinger investment co of del  br  d del  distinguishing tekniplex it is also distinguishable on its facts because in tekniplex the law firm whose communications were at issue had represented the merged corporations owner on personal matters for many years tekniplex  ny d at  the personal representation continued through the negotiation and execution of a merger id in contrast in the situation before me wishart norris was explicitly retained by old utilipath to carry out the utilipath transaction and other lawyers were retained to personally represent the parties in the transaction under bevill the individuals asserting the privilege have a specific burden which they have failed to meet because wishart norris represented the corporation the corporations postmerger owners took control of the corporations attorneyclient privilege weintraub  us at  all the parties agreed that when control of a corporation passes to new management the authority to assert and waive the corporations attorneyclient privilege passes as well great hill  ad  ii conclusion the request by new utilipath and baxter hayes jr baxter parties that i enter an order declaring that they control the attorney client privilege as to all communications with wishart norris prior to august   will be denied utilipath llcs request for an order that they control the attorney client privilege as to old utilipaths communications with wishart norris will be granted having failed to establish that they are entitled to assert a personal privilege the request of baxter hayes iii and jarrod hayes that an individualized document review be conducted will be denied in reaching this conclusion i do not decide whether the baxter parties waived their attorney client privilege with respect to documents left on utilipath servers after the sale of control furthermore this order is without prejudice as to any parties rights to assert privilege as to specific communications for personal legal advice from wishart norris should such a document exist to the extent that counsel for the baxter parties jarrod or lindon may have shared information with wishart norris or other counsel as part of the community of interest carrying out the merger of utilipath and sale of control while such communications may not be withheld from utilipath i do not decide whether the community of interest privilege shields such communications from parties other than utilipath an appropriate order follows footnotes  the legal authority upon which wishart norris relied is not apparent on the record before me comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom
