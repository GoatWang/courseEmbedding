item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements related notes and other detailed information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap contemplate that we will continue as a going concern and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern however our independent registered public accounting firm has added explanatory paragraphs in note  of each of our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern certain information contained below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k including information regarding our plans and strategy for our business constitute forwardlooking statements see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements overview we are a development stage company organized under the laws of the state of nevada in january  our business is to develop and operate internet websites and mobile phone applications and we intend to earn revenues through advertisements sold on these websites and mobile platforms our goal is to become the largest network of consumerbased websites and iphone applications and similar mobile platforms targeting viewers in the hong kong and greater china basin with contents on travel food entertainment activities and city life we plan to develop additional websites and mobile phone applications we generate advertising revenues through banner and payperclick advertisements as well as through application user fees results of operations two years ended december   and  net sales we generated revenues of  for the year ended december   compared to  for fiscal  the decrease in revenue was mainly due to discounts offered to our advertisers our principal source of revenues is from advertising banners on our websites we also intend to generate future revenues from advertising and user fees related to our mobile phone applications net income loss we have incurred a net loss of  in  compared to a net loss of  in  principally due to a substantial increase in our administrative expenses as discussed below we had other income of  in  and nil in  attributable to the writeoff of accrued director fees and secretary fees we incurred general administrative and operating expenses of  in  and  in  of these amounts nil and  related to the value of director fees to our directors in each of  and  respectively in lieu of cash compensation for services rendered in addition a substantial portion of our expenses for the year ended december   related to accounting service fees legal service fees and professional service fees and for the year ended december   related to accounting service fees and professional service fees taxes due to our lack of revenues we have not incurred any tax obligations since inception however we would anticipate that income tax obligations will arise as we begin to generate significant revenue in the future liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at december   an increase of  this increase is principally due to the increase in cash provided in operation currently we have limited operating capital we expect that our current capital and our other existing resources will be sufficient only to provide a limited amount of working capital and the revenues if any generated from our business operations alone may not be sufficient to fund our operations or planned growth we will likely require additional capital to continue to operate our business and to further expand our business we expect our cash flow needs over the next  months to be approximately  however this amount may be materially increased if market conditions are favorable for a more rapid expansion of our business model or if we adjust our model to exploit strategic acquisition opportunities in addition we may require additional cash flow to support our public company reporting requirements in the united states although our average monthly expenditures to date have averaged less than  we expect this rate to increase exponentially as our business expands to date we have been financed principally by our directors however we expect to secure third party financing or bank loans as necessary until we secure sufficient revenues principally from advertisers on our websites to sustain our ongoing operations sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing bank loans or revolving credit facilities we may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means our inability to raise additional funds when required may have a negative impact on our operations business development and financial results offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase these judgments become even more subjective and complex we have identified the following accounting policies described below as the most critical to an understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents the company considers all shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents impairment of longlived assets the company accounts for the impairment of longlived assets such as plant and equipment leasehold land and intangible assets under the provisions of fasb accounting standard codification topic  asc  property plant and equipment  overall formerly known as sfas no  accounting for the impairment of longlived assets sfas  asc  establishes the accounting for impairment of longlived tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and for the disposal of a business pursuant to asc  the company periodically evaluates at least annually whether facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the longlived asset or the appropriate grouping of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that the carrying amount of longlived assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows then the carrying amount of such assets is adjusted to their fair value the company reports an impairment cost as a charge to operations at the time it is recognized income taxes the company utilizes fasb accounting standard codification topic  asc  income taxes formerly known as sfas no  accounting for income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized asc  income taxes formerly known as interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no  fin  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions this interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than  likely of being realized changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgement occurs the company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits if and when required as part of income tax expense in the statements of operations the adoption of asc  did not have a significant effect on the financial statements comprehensive income the company has adopted fasb accounting standard codification topic  asc  comprehensive income formerly known as sfas no  reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income its components and accumulated balances accumulated other comprehensive income represents the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation adjustments of the company stockbased compensation the company has adopted fasb accounting standard codification topic  asc  stock compensation formerly known as sfas r sharebased payment which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock option grants based on estimated fair values asc  requires companies to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model the value of the awards portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods prior to the adoption of asc  we accounted for sharebased awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method under the intrinsic value method sharebased compensation expense was only recognized by us if the exercise price of the stock option was less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant the company accounts for stockbased compensation to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  equity based payments to nonemployees measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees shall be based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued the fair value of the sharebased payment transactions should be determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date issuance of shares for service the company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance whichever is more reliably measurable foreign currencies translation the functional currency of the company is hong kong dollars hk the company maintains its financial statements in the functional currency monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective periods for financial reporting purposes the financial statements of the group which are prepared using

foreign exchange adjustment to other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables deposits trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the shortterm maturity of such instruments the carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair values because the applicable interest rates approximate current market rates earnings per share basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share the average market price during the year is used to compute equivalent shares fasb accounting standard codification topic  asc  earnings per share requires that employee equity share options nonvested shares and similar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share should be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited unless doing so would be antidilutive the company uses the treasury stock method for equity instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions provided in asc  to determine diluted earnings per share website development costs the company recognized the costs associated with developing a website in accordance with asc  website development cost that codified the
