need to dread april th though — that’s right the  filing deadline is april th not the traditional date of the th tax software has come along way and if you choose the right option you’ll be able to knock your taxes out quickly and confidently ’s list of the best tax software companies features three faithful standouts turbotax hr block and taxact get started on intuits secure website we have a clear favorite pick this year the fourth year in a row in fact it’s turbotax and it’s our top pick for several reasons it’s the easiest to use it has the most comprehensive set of features and best of all it’s absolutely free for millions of americans filing a ez or a and state returns thanks to a resurgence of the company’s absolute zero program that’s available to anyone who has an income of less than  doesn’t have sizable medical bills to deduct and doesn’t claim any rental investment or business income pretty great right the simple dollar’s picks for the best tax software for  turbotax hr block taxact the best tax software doesn’t just get your taxes filed — it educates users leaving them confident about their return rather than worried about an audit as a result we dug deep into user experience this year we put each software package through the wringer evaluating facilitation disbursement accuracy tools and deduction discovery we also considered how much we enjoyed using it yes you can enjoy using tax software we also looked for a few key features an accuracy guarantee auditrisk identification tools multiple refunddisbursement options strong customer support and the ability to import all of your forms and data and when we learned that the number of turbotax users  million filing from smartphones and tablets is up  percent from the previous year we favored software with great mobile apps too turbotax hr block or taxact what is the best tax software turbotax start turbotax federal free edition here intuit’s turbotax remains the industry’s most streamlined and intuitive tax software package for the  fiscal year whether you’re selfemployed freelancing on the side or filing a ez turbotax has all the tools you need to minimize headaches and capitalize on your return just remember its pricing schedule is a bit more confusing and expensive than competitors so you might wind up paying more than you imagined depending on the complexity of your tax situation one of turbotax’s most compelling features is smartlook™ which connects users with a cpa or enrolled agent via oneway video users can share their screen and receive expert help for free with an unlimited amount of requests what’s more intuit improved the tool for  by adding the ability to schedule appointments which tightens its competition with hr block which boasts  inperson locations nationwide smartlook™ isn’t available for federal free edition users but outside of sitting in a room with a tax professional it’s one of the best customer support tools in the industry bar none turbotax also upped its game this year with the launch of a brandnew tool for the selfemployed called expense finder once connected to a user’s bank account expense finder helps to pinpoint every single transaction from the past year that might qualify as an expense it can be difficult to keep track of every nickel and dime spent on things like travel and food so this is a welcome addition to

customer service with over  locations in the united states you’re likely not far from speaking facetoface with a professional who can help you sift through the financial maze and regardless of which plan edition you choose you also get free inperson audit support the company’s software isn’t quite as simple or featurerich as turbotax but it can be more affordable for smallbusiness owners and those with multiple investments and properties turbotax’s “premium” edition runs about  state and federal while hr block’s “premium” edition costs around  both cover the same forms from schedules c d e and f those that are related to deductions selfemployment and investment income but hr block customers get the benefit of inperson support while also saving  taxact start with taxact here taxact is the most affordable option out there consider this the company’s topoftheline edition called premium runs  and includes forms from schedules c d e and f — that means freelancers homeowners investors and the selfemployed can take advantage of the same deductions available on turbotax’s “selfemployed”  and “premium”  editions for almost half the price however taxact has limited efiling capabilities because it doesn’t support forms  and  in every state so if you plan to file online make sure to check whether taxact supports the forms you need the flipside to its affordability is that taxact doesn’t offer as robust customer support as the likes of turbotax’s smartlook™ cpa video chat or hr block’s  office sites but if you don’t mind forgoing the bells and whistles taxact is one of the best and most affordable software options available still sounding a little too spendy check out our best free tax software guide to see if there is a good option that fits your needs what should the

turbotax the best tax preparation software turbotax is undeniably the most recognizable name in tax prep software and it has the chops to back it up its audit and deduction tools are the best in the business and its list of features is ever growing with the addition of smartlook™ video support and expense finder for the selfemployed and like hr block turbotax allows users to upload their w by taking a picture with a mobile device if your payroll provider is one of turbotax’s many partners you can even import your w online here are a few more highlights a comprehensive federal free edition that includes ez a and  forms as well as live chat incredibly easytouse software the best mobile app in the business expense finder which helps the selfemployed identify every possible deduction incredibly thorough answerxchange knowledge base strong customer support including smartlook™ expert video chat headsup audit detection while you file your taxes a wide array of disbursement options trusty phone support hotline turbotax downsides while turbotax is the overall best tax software in the field it’s not without its weaknesses as many disgruntled users will point out the price has steadily climbed over the past few years and stands as one of the most expensive options on the market for example turbotax charges  to file federal taxes online compared to competitor hr block’s  but like we mentioned before if you have a simple tax situation you can file absolutely free through turbotax’s absolute zero program it’s also important to note the company has a steep processing fee of  if you pay your turbotax fee with your federal refund hr block the best customer support at an affordable price with over  locations spanning the us hr block is able to provide a personal touch that turbotax and taxact can’t match and the best part is that no matter which plan you choose — the free online edition or the paid desktop edition — everyone gets access to a reallife tax professional all you have to do is visit the office with the giant green block here are a few more highlights standout tools to help with more complex tax needs including deductions helpful pagebypage overviews and stepbystep workflow guidance premium edition is  cheaper than turbotax’s peppered with links throughout each page to answer any questions you might have such as “what qualifies” a bookmarking system lets you tag anything you want to refer to later file federal taxes for free with the at home free edition which provides many tax forms other competitors don’t plus free audit support and representation hr block downsides right now you may be asking “with such incredible customer service why isn’t hr block the best tax software” frankly its bland website and slightly confusing interface can’t compete with the simplicity of turbotax but if you’d feel more confident having a copilot on your tax journey hr’s marginally less attractive software is hardly a good reason to skip it taxact the best cheap tax software taxact is undeniably one of the most affordable tax software options on the market for the standard taxpayer — its most expensive plan is less than half the price of turbotax and it supports the exact same forms a big reason for these savings is found in its lack of features for the selfemployed investors or property owners to be clear you can still use taxact if you fit in those categories but it won’t be as easy as using turbotax or hr block the bottom line is this if you’re a straightforward w employee with a simple return taxact has all you need to effectively file your taxes and save some cash here are a few more highlights offers top value without sacrificing quality only extras provides a prebuilt spreadsheet where you enter information like reporting category sales proceeds gainslosses and other relevant stock information limited state efiling a useful “refund snapshot” dashboard minialerts identify errors and robust learning resources make sure you get all the help you need with the free edition you can file federal tax forms for simple and complex tax returns for different statuses and life situations taxact downsides taxact’s educational resources have improved since last year but it still doesn’t match turbotax’s offerings it also has a few lightweight features like a deductions calculator and “life changes” event wizard which alerts customers to important information related to life events and how they impact taxes but they aren’t as fleshed out as comparable tools from the other companies finally taxact doesn’t allow you to import your w by taking a photo like turbotax and hr block once you put it in manually though you can important it from previous tax returns in the future other tax software to consider although turbotax hr block and taxact were our top picks taxslayer and esmarttax are also worth a look taxslayer taxslayer highlights you can choose to be guided or not which is great if you’re confident in your tax abilities and want to bypass all the quizzes prioryear tax form access makes it easy to prepare your forms and alter them to save time the life events guide makes sure you correctly input information about births a new home etc why taxslayer didn’t make the cut deduction tools aren’t as strong as the top three — items like charity donations rental properties and industryspecific deductions aren’t identified no live chat or user forum to get help instantly — however your questions do jump to the front of the queue for faster response time via the premium service esmarttax esmarttax highlights great affordable care act aca forms and resources a clean and modern interface makes this software easy to navigate owned by liberty tax which has office locations available for inperson help you can import prioryear forms and prepopulate information to save time why esmarttax didn’t make the cut it’s missing some of the more common features like a life events adviser and tax calculator deduction discovery resources are very limited which won’t suffice for more complicated tax situations saleofhome feature is only available at its premium level the sale of a home is a fairly common transaction that would be a nobrainer at a deluxe tier level final thoughts whether you’re filing for your family your business or yourself the biggest piece of advice is to be proactive while we all lead busy lives it’s always best to get a jump on the upcoming tax season and not let it sneak up on you admittedly there will never be a replacement for hiring a professional to take care of your taxes but for anyone looking to save some money and take matters into their own hands we’ve found turbotax to be the best tax software on the market its ease of use and intuitive design paired with the gravitas carried by its name make it the premier option on the market hr block and taxact aren’t hanging too far behind offering unsurpassed customer service and affordability respectively but for the majority of taxpayers your best bet is the slick industry hallmark turbotax loading disqus comments  please enable javascript to view the comments powered by
