excellent healthcare for our patients our facilities specialize in a small number of highermargin specialties and procedures – orthopedics neurosurgery and general surgery surgeons are able to reserve large blocks of time in adjoining operating rooms so they can perform consecutive procedures without the usual disruptions occurring in general hospitals procedures are generally not bumped due to emergencies and there are no compromises in equipment or staff that is why we have designed our facilities to be much more patient and stafffriendly than those of larger hospitals surgeons have access to adjacent operating rooms in close proximity to intensive care and diagnostic units nurses and staff are professional and courteous all of this means that our patients enjoy much more relaxed healthful surroundings where more oneonone attention is the rule not the exception  we believe that our facilities attract premier surgeons who wish to take more control over their practices because our facilities focus on limited types of procedures scheduling is much more efficient and predictable this means that the surgeons’ time is optimally utilized making their services available to more patients in less time  we strive to attract top surgeons by allowing them more authority and ability to specify the quality equipment they want and need we also give them more decision making power on nursing and support staff decisions as well as the ability to become partners in the business this means our physician partners can generate income in two ways – through increased volume of procedures as well as a share of the profits from our facilities this means that they have a vested interest in the success of the facility  in other words – our business model provides a supportive environment for patients and also enables surgeons to gain more control over their work their time and their income   copyright   dynacq healthcare inc all rights reserved privacy policy jordan  black
