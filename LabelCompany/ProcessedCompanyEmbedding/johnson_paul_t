an artist and principal of the art school in burslem stokeontrent staffordshire at stonyhurst johnson received an education grounded in the jesuit method which he preferred over the more secularized curriculum of oxford one of his tutors at oxford was the historian a j p taylor after graduating with a secondclass honours degree johnson performed his national service in the army joining the kings royal rifle corps and then the royal army educational corps where he was commissioned as a captain acting based mainly in gibraltar here he saw the grim misery and cruelty of the franco regime johnsons military record helped the paris periodical realités hire him where he was assistant editor from  to  johnson adopted a leftwing political outlook during this period as he witnessed in may  the police response to a riot in paris the ferocity of which i would not have believed had i not seen it with my own eyes communists were rioting over the visit of an anticommunist commander matthew ridgeway during the korean war then he served as the new statesmans paris correspondent for a time he was a convinced bevanite and an associate of aneurin bevan himself moving back to london in  johnson joined the statesmans staff some of johnsons writing already showed signs of iconoclasm his first book about the suez war appeared in  an anonymous commentator in the spectator wrote that one of his johnsons remarks about mr gaitskell is quite as damaging as anything he has to say about sir anthony eden but the labour partys opposition to the suez intervention led johnson to assert the old militant spirit of the party was back the following year he attacked ian flemings james bond novel dr no and in  he warned of the menace of beatlism in an article contemporarily described as being rather exaggerated by henry fairlie in the spectator he was successively lead writer deputy editor and editor of the new statesman magazine from  to  he was found suspect for his attendances at the soirées of lady antonia fraser then married to a conservative mp there was some resistance to his appointment as new statesman editor not least from the writer leonard woolf who objected to a catholic filling the position and johnson was placed on six months probationcitation needed statesmen and nations  the anthology of his statesman articles contains numerous reviews of biographies of conservative politicians and an openness to continental europe in one article johnson took a positive view of events of may  in paris an article which at the time of first publication led colin welch in the spectator to accuse johnson of possessing a taste for violence according to this book johnson filed  overseas reports during his statesman years shift rightwardedit in the s johnson became increasingly conservative in his outlook and has largely remained so in his enemies of society  following a series of articles in the british press he opposed the trade union movement perceiving it as violent and intolerant terming trade unionists fascists as britain’s economy faltered johnson began to advocate the future british prime minister margaret thatcher’s message of less government and less taxation he was eventually won over to the right and became one of thatchers closest advisers in the s britain was on its knees the left had no answers i became disgusted by the overpowerful trade unions which were destroying britain he recalled in  after thatchers victory in the general election of  johnson advised on changes to legislation concerning trade unions and was also one of thatchers speechwriters johnson was quoted in  i was instantly drawn to her he recalls i’d known margaret at oxford she was not a party person she was an individual who made up her own mind people would say that she was much influenced by karl popper or frederick hayek the result was that thatcher followed three guiding principles truthfulness honesty and never borrowing money from  to  johnson wrote a column for the spectator initially focusing on media developments it subsequently acquired the title and another thing in his journalism johnson generally deals with issues and events which he sees as indicative of a general social decline whether in art education religious observance or personal conduct he has continued to contribute to the magazine less frequently than before during the same period he contributed a column to the daily mail until  in a daily telegraph interview in november  he criticised the mail for having a pernicious impact i came to the conclusion that that kind of journalism is bad for the country bad for society bad for the newspaper johnson is a regular contributor to the daily telegraph mainly as a book reviewer and in the united states to the new york times the wall street journal commentary and the national review he also writes for forbes magazine for a time in the early s he wrote for the sun after rupert murdoch urged him to raise its tone a bit johnson is a critic of modernity because of what he sees as its moral relativism and finds objectionable those who use charles darwins theory of evolution to justify their atheism or use it to promote biotechnological experimentation as a result richard dawkins and steven pinker have been a target of johnsons criticism as a conservative catholic johnson regards liberation theology as a heresy and defends clerical celibacy but departs from others in seeing many good reasons for ordination of women as priests admired by conservatives in the united states and elsewhere he is strongly anticommunist johnson has defended richard nixon in the watergate scandal finding his coverup considerably less heinous than bill clintons perjury and oliver norths involvement in the irancontra affair in his spectator column johnson defended his friend jonathan aitken has expressed admiration for general augusto pinochet and qualified admiration for general franco johnson was active in the campaign led by norman lamont to prevent pinochets extradition to spain after pinochets arrest in london there have been countless attempts to link him to human rights atrocities but nobody has provided a single scrap of evidence johnson was reported as saying in  in heroes  johnson returned to his longstanding claim that criticism of pinochets regime on human rights grounds came from the soviet union whose propaganda machine successfully demonised pinochet among the chattering classes all over the world it was the last triumph of the kgb before it vanished into historys dustbin he has described france as a republic run by bureaucratic and party elites whose errors are dealt with by strikes street riots and blockades rather than a democracy he served on the royal commission on the press – and was a member of the cable authority regulator from  to  in  johnson was honoured with the presidential medal of freedom by us president george w bush on the bbc programme desert island
