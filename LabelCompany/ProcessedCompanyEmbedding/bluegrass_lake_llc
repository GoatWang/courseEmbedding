with corners at adjacent side walls and four mounting supports extending radially from said corners adapted to frictionally engage internal corners within said mounting block  the structure claimed in claim  further comprising a plate fixed to and covering an outer surface of said mounting block said plate having an exterior surface which extends beyond peripheral edges of a front wall of said mounting block description backgroundthe use of lapped siding ie vinyl aluminum etc on buildings increases the difficulty of mounting electrical fixtures such as light fixtures electrical outlets and the like to the sides of buildings a product was developed which provided a mounting surface for the electrical fixture and was easily integrated into siding this device is disclosed in vagedes et al us pat no  this is mounted to the side of a building with or without the use of an electrical box the problem with this mounting block and similar blocks is that it is not fire resistant to be fire resistant a mounting block must be made from a fire resistant plastic and further there must be an electric box attached to the rear surface of a mounting block generally mounting blocks are not deep enough for a standard electric boxmaking the mounting block itself fire resistant significantly increases the cost of the product one attempted solution to this problem is disclosed in us pat no  which uses a mounting block that has an electrical box that snap fits into the opening the electrical box made from fire resistant material is attached directly to the electrical fixture in order to facilitate electrical wires and electrical outlets the box needs to be significantly deeper making the mounting block somewhat unsightlyplastic mounting blocks generally match the color of the siding siding comes in a wide variety of colors thus stocking mounting blocks which match all siding colors is very expensivesummary of the inventionthe present invention is premised on the realization that a fire resistant mounting structure for an exterior electrical fixture can be formed from a mounting block having a flange a front wall and four side walls a standard opening is provided in the front wall the interior of the mounting block holds a separate fire resistant electric box that has an opening substantially larger than the opening on the front surface of the mounting block interposed between the electric box and the mounting block is a separate fire resistant plate which restricts the opening on the electric box making it correspond in size to the opening in the mounting block the interposed plate and the electric box are formed from fire resistant material this combined structure is fire resistant at the same time this provides more than adequate room for electrical wiring andor an electrical outlet the electric box can include four supports that extend from each corner these supports locate the box and plate in the mounting blockpreferably the structure includes a peripheral ring that snaps on to conceal the cut edges of sidingfurther in a preferred embodiment the structure includes a plate which mounts onto the front surface and covers the front surface as well as the peripheral ring if the plate is metal it makes the mounting appear to be metal such as brass or the like plastic plates can be used to match the color of the siding thus only one color mounting block is required and less expensive cover plates can be used to match the siding colorthe objects and advantages of the present invention will be further appreciated in light of the following detailed description and drawings in whichbrief description of drawingsfig  is a perspective view of the structure of the present invention partially broken awayfig  is an exploded view of the fig fig  is a perspective view of the electrical box and interposed platefig  is a perspective view of the mounting box covering the interposed plate and the electrical boxfig  is a perspective view partially broken away depicting a cover plate covering the structure of the present inventionfig  is a plan view of the electric box used in the present inventionfig  is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the present inventionfig  is a crosssectional view of the cover plate taken at lines — of fig fig  is a crosssectional view of the cover plate taken at lines — of fig detailed descriptionas shown in figs  and  the present invention is a mounting structure  for an electrical light fixture electric outlet or the like not shown the mounting structure includes an innermost electric box  which is covered by a mounting block  a cover plate  is interposed between the electric box  and a front wall  of the mounting block  this combined structure is attached to a wall  of a building as shown in fig  with siding  abutting the side walls   and  of mounting block the edges of the siding are then in turn covered with an exterior snap on ring  the entire structure  can in turn be covered by a plate  as shown in fig more particularly the electric box includes four side walls    and  locating supports  extend tangentially from each corner  inwardly extended portions     from the side walls support screw holes     these four screw holes in the mounting block  are positioned so that they can facilitate mounting of either an electrical light fixture with holes  and  diagonally spaced ie about ″ or an electrical duplex outlet with vertically spaced holes  and  ie about ″back wall  of the box includes a punch out  for a mechanical wire fastener or alternately a fastening tab  to receive electric cable such as romex brand cable each of the inwardly extended portions  includes a boss a b c d which extend slightly above the forward edge  of the electric box  this extends roughly the thickness of plate  and therefore is flush with the forward surface  of plate  when assembled with plate  resting on edge  of box  electric box  also includes a boss  designed to receive a ground screwplate  is sized to cover electric box  plate  further includes a standard sized rectangular opening  generally ″ by ½″ and also includes four cut out portions a b c d adapted to receive the bosses  of the extended portions  plate  is simply positioned over the electric box  completely covering the opening of the box  this forms a complete fire resistant electric box cut out portions a and c are larger than bosses a and d providing an open area aligned with open areas in box  this provides clearance for mounting screws for light fixtures and gfi coverplates the front wall of block  has corresponding openingsthe mounting block  in turn has a peripheral flange  extended from side walls  front wall  includes an opening  corresponding in size and shape to the opening  in plate  this opening should be about equal to or larger than the opening in plate  the four supports  of the electric box  engage the internal surface of the four corners  of block  aligning all these elements and provide a wedge fitring  which snap fits over block  has an internal surface  corresponding to the four walls  of the mounting block  it includes first and second tabs  only left side showing which are adapted to snap into first and second indentations   in the side walls  and  of the mounting block  this ring  simply covers the exterior edges of siding once the unit  is installedto install the unit of the present invention a wire  is attached to the electric box  either through the opening at tab  or with an electrical connector through knockout  the plate  is then placed over the electric box  and the mounting block  is placed over the combined electric box  and plate  the supports  frictionally engage internal corners of the mounting block and will properly locate the box  within the mounting block  to center the screw holes  in the box  with the openings  in plate  in the front wall  of the mounting block  the wall flange of block  is nailed to the exterior wall  of a building this holds the electric box  and plate  compressed between the wall  and front wall  of block  siding  is attached to the building abutting the four wails of the mounting block  ring  is snap fitted onto the side walls  and  of the mounting block  the top of ring  is flush with the front wall  of the mounting block an electrical fixture not shown can then be attached to the wire  in the electric box  and screwed onto box  using holes  and  or  and  depending on the type of fixture the open area above and below mounting holes  and  will provide clearance for fixture mounting screws this combination of two sets of holes and the open areas above and below holes  and  permits most light fixtures switches and outlets to be mounteda cover plate  can be employed to cover the entire mounting structure  positioned between structure  and the electric fixture and provide a unique appearance as shown in fig  plate  covers the entire front surface of wall  and extends beyond the edge of the mounting block  and the ring  as shown in fig  the opening  in plate  has an inwardly extended lip  which centers the plate with opening  in block  this will in turn be held in position permanently when an electrical fixture is attached to the box by screws or bolts extending from the electrical fixture into the screw holes  and  or  and  alternately as shown in fig  metal or plastic tabs  can be used to center the plate a the plate can also be centered by its lower surface corresponding in size and shape to the ring  optionally centering tabs or posts not shown can extend from the backside of plate  and fit into corresponding openings in the front wall  of block  these can provide an interference fit to temporarily hold the plate in placethis cover plate  can be used with or without the ring  and can be used with any plastic mounting block as long as the plate has a dimension which extends beyond the side walls of the mounting block  thus it can be used to retrofit existing mounting blocks plate  can be plastic metal or metal coated plastic further it can be square rectangular or oval ie nonrectangular it can be significantly larger than the block and used to mount a coach fixture ie where the fixture is larger than the blockas indicated the electric box  and plate  are preferably made from a fire resistant plastic or metal suitable for an exterior building their color is not relevant as they will be totally concealed by the mounting block  and any electrical fixture the block  and ring  can then be formed from a different nonfire rated plastic this reduces the cost of structure  while maintaining overall fire resistance the color of the block  and ring  should match or accent the siding the present invention provides a mounting structure for an electrical fixture which is fire resistant whereas the mounting block  itself does not need to be made from fire resistant material the inner electrical box  and intermediate plate  provides the fire resistant structure changing the color of the block will not affect the fire rating of the product this encases the electrical wiring within a fire resistant structure making it compliant with current electrical codes further due to the use of the intermediate plate an electrical box can be molded or stamped to provide a large space for wiring without the need for an unsightly deep mounting block the permanent locating supports on the mounting box ensure that when it is assembled the opening in the electrical box is properly located within the mounting block and further facilitates quick assembly of the structure finally the metal plate that can be attached to the exterior surface providing a truly unique appearance for the mounting block thus the present invention facilitates easy installation provides adequate room for electrical wires provides fire resistance and improves the overall appearance of the mounting blockthis has been a description of the present invention along with the preferred method of practicing the invention however the invention itself should only be defined by the appended claims wherein we claim  previous patent fuse box
