leading universities in the world integrates global macroeconomic analysis with indepth country research to help identify longterm imbalances that translate to investment opportunities global growthheadwinds or tailwinds dr michael hasenstab cio templeton global macro provides a counterpoint to recent pessimistic forecasts for global growth  regionbyregion analysis united states eurozone russia china japan emerging markets research process view the complete video commentary     key points from the topic paper this paper global growth headwinds or tailwinds aims to provide an objective analysis of the main trends shaping the global economy in  global economic pessimism unwarranted excessive pessimism characterizes the current view on the global growth outlook with some of this sentiment due to a mistaken interpretation of the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in oil prices we see the decline in oil prices as being largely due to a positive supply shock rather than a weakening of oil demand a positive supply shock that drives down the price of oil provides a significant boost to global growth though we think there will also be winners and losers us economy keeps rolling the us economy benefits significantly from lower oil prices and is currently in a kind of goldilocks scenario the recovery has firmed while receiving a boost from lower oil prices those lower oil prices are helping keep inflationary pressures muted thus allowing the federal reserve to maintain very low interest rates however base effects on energy prices will be much less favorable down the road and combined with a tighter labor market and faster economic growth could result in a meaningful acceleration in inflation pressures at that point we might see a sudden upward adjustment in bond yields this growth and inflation outlook also implies that current us dollar strength still has longer to run europe benefitting from tailwinds the eurozone economy relies to a very important extent on exports and should benefit from several strong tailwinds largely being ignored by the financial markets first robust growth in the us particularly in terms of consumer demand should provide solid support for eurozone exports to the us second the european central banks effectively openended stimulus program will put further downward pressure on the euro also boosting exports third the decline in oil prices will support growth adding to the potential for european growth to surprise to the upside this year abenomics positive but not final japan appears to have exited the cycle of deflation and contraction in nominal growth since the launch of abenomics however japan now needs decisive action to raise its potential growth path consolidate the positive inflation dynamics and improve revenue collection all three conditions are needed to secure stronger growth and debt sustainability progress in  will be the key test china rebalancing china as the worlds largest importer of oil will also be an important beneficiary of lower energy prices which would help mitigate the countrys mild and healthy slowdown however some observers have argued the chinas growth rate is actually much lower than indicated by official statistics we believe this argument simply does not stand up to scrutiny and we think the rebalancing of chinas economy might be further along than is commonly believed overall we see the dynamics at play as meaning that the country can support a gradual rebalancing at a more moderate sustainable pace of growth that can still contribute strongly to global growth oil impact on emerging markets differentiated markets perceive the sharp reduction in oil prices as a net negative for all emerging markets rather than a major source of differentiation the emergingmarkets world includes some of the worlds largest oil producers but also some of its largest oil consumers we believe the oil price decline is likely to further accentuate the differentiation between the worlds strong and poor performers particularly among emerging markets our view is that the overall outlook is sufficiently supportive to allow countries with sound policies to thrive we will likely see great differentiation in crosscountry performances making fundamentalsbased investment strategies critical templeton global macro michael hasenstab phd executive vice president
