promotional pricing strategiescommunity qa using an effective pricing strategy can be the difference between a hopping business and a dud youve already done the work to come up with a killer product and an unforgettable hook for your business so now you just need to price it accordingly learn to determine your overhead raise and lower appropriately and use promotional pricing to your advantage and youll be in the black in no time steps part  determining overhead  calculate the cost of running your business a basic pricing method requires that you determine the full cost of running your business and price your product in such a way as to keep your business in the black so the first thing you need to do is calculate how much it costs to run your business these costs can be further divided into direct and indirect costs add up your direct costs are those which are immediately associated with doing business these costs get directly assigned to your products and services you provide labor costs marketing costs manufacturing costs cost of raw materials equipment etc indirect costs are things associated with keeping things running and the day to day these are sometimes thought of as the hidden or even “true cost” of running a business operating expenses including rent on your building utilities etc debt service costs return on any investment capital cleaning and office supplies your own salary  set a success point the only reason to start a business is to make money and specifically to make enough money to keep the venture a successful enterprise for this reason you need to set a point at which you would consider the business successful your success point and add that figure to your expenses to determine how much revenue you need to generate from sales once you know how much money you need to make for the business to be successful then you can start getting some sense of what a successful price would be for your product it may take some number of years to master your market  anticipate your customers desires another major figure that you need to determine is how much merchandise you might reliably sell in a given period this will be determined by your customers buying tendencies identify your customer base and their buying tendencies how much do they desire your particular product is there a demand for it be as specific as possible in your discussion of numbers how much is it possible to sell given your current resources how much do you need to sell to maintain the visibility and success of your current model what might need to be changed divide your success point by the number of units you think might be reliably sold to determine a price guideline per unit this isnt necessarily to say that this should be the price but this is a good number to start experimenting with and seeing how your customers will respond provide genuine customer service not just lip service  study your competition if you sell custommade iphone cases are there other companies that provide similar services where how much do their products cost how is their company run you need to learn everything you can about your competition so you can learn to differentiate yourself from their model to get your share of the common market say youre one of two frozen yogurt stands in your town and you cant figure out why your  a cup cheap for the ingredients organic coconut rosemary kefir isnt bringing in the masses while the dairy queen across town sells regular chocolate cones like theyre going out of style you need to be familiar with their prices and their customer base so you can stay competitive and stay relevant do you share the same customer base is there another customer base you might tap into and market to to make your business more viable is anyone ever going to be willing to pay your prices these are important questions for a successful business to consider when pricing use a search engine to research your competition social media and the internet have changed the ways customers find business part  raising and lowering prices  understand the effects of over and under pricing setting the price inefficiently will have marked and measurable effects on your numbers you need to learn to recognize the symptoms of having either a low or high price point this can indicate that you may need to make a change underpricing is often done by companies who want to sell a higher volume expecting that the customer will assume theyre getting a deal especially in a down economy doing this however can give the impression that the product is cheap not that theyre getting their moneys worth overpricing may drive your customers elsewhere especially when youre trying to get your feet on the ground as your business gets started it can be tempting to set the price too high the investment of starting a business can be scary and youll probably want to start covering costs right away but consider the customers point of view setting it at a point youll make money will only work if people are willing to pay for it  keep a close eye on your pricing and your budget monitor your profits and prices at least monthly break down the costgains of every product so that you know how each contributes to your overall profitability monthtomonth this can give a clear picture of your money flow talk to your customers and listen to their feedback take it to heart if they enjoy your product but complain about the price you might consider making a change develop a budget plan try to focus on a long term strategy that will result in making the business profitable this might not involve making drastic changes right away but slowly moving toward an overall goal of profitability  raise prices slowly and incrementally jumping from selling an iphone case for  to selling one for  will undoubtedly lose you customers even if the price change is right for the business and a smart move instead raise it incrementally and spend time advertising the products benefits and advantages as opposed to apologizing for the increase treat it as a benefit rather than an inconvenience sudden increases will look like desperate moves made by a struggling business which may or may not be true you want to avoid the impression that youre raising the prices because you need to make more money rather you need to make it seem as if youre raising prices because the product is just that good0 watch your sales volume immediately after making the change if the move was too sudden youll see a negative change suggesting that you need to do more to sell the new variation on the product and justify its price  use promotions to lower prices and get people in the store unless your competition is lowering their price or youre just not getting the kind of traffic in your business that you need in order to make it profitable you generally want to avoid lowering prices lowering the price may suggest another kind of desperationthat people are avoiding your store using promotions for limited periods of time or coupons that expire you can help drive customers toward a particular product or service use discount tactics and promotions rather than lowering the price all at once you can even alter the amount that someone gets for the same price for example november is a month of diabetes awareness during november you may charge more for sugary drinks and to recoup the cost of charging less on healthy foods make sure to the customers about this as it can help to drive their choices as well as make them feel better about paying more for something they will also know that the price changes are limited avoid seeming desperate for example an empty restaurant may give the impression that the food is not delicious especially if it suddenly becomes very cheap people may feel the product is of inferior quality part  using promotional pricing strategies  use creative promotions to get people in the door pricing in order to promote a product is a very common application this gives the consumer the impression that your business is a place to go to get deals even if youre not always giving them deals try letting your pricing strategies advertise for you use a buy one get one free promotion to get people interested in your product and ensure that theyll be struck by the deals theyre getting if you can keep them coming back even when youre not holding promotions theyll be hooked often sellers will bundle several products in the same package moving old or unwanted stock by creating killer deals dated dvds cds and video games are often sold using the bundle approach quantity discounts 0 off 0 or more and rebates  after rebate can also help to get people to purchase more  appeal to your customers emotions and rationality promotional pricing strategies cant just be informational campaigns they have to connect with your target market in order to do this take time to appeal to their emotions or pragmatism a common business strategy involves pricing items in  cent increments rather than dollar increments at a glance the difference in savings seems huge even though its nonexistent practically pricing judiciously will help you keep sales high without changing your strategy considerably consider creating a premium package to upsell customers on moderately improved versions of the basically the same product but with more sophistication ie more marketing consider establishing a line of products with varying levels at which the customer can engage car washes will often use this pricing strategy a basic wash could be  wash and wax  and the whole package   try to upsell promotions to move more merchandise in optional product pricing companies will attempt to increase the amount customers spend once they start to buy optional extras increase the overall price of the product or service for example airlines will charge for optional extras such as guaranteeing a window seat or reserving a row of seats next to each other historically promotions have proven to be a better driver than advertising one drawback to promotions is that they tend to be followed by lower levels of purchasing of that same product or service directly following the promotion  avoid the appearance of price gouging gouging involves raising your product to a high price because you have a substantial competitive advantage of some kind or a corner of the market this advantage is not sustainable the high price tends to attract new competitors into the market and the price inevitably falls due to increased supply captive product pricing is used when products have complements companies will charge a premium price where the consumer is captured for example a razor manufacturer will charge a low price and recoup its margin and more from the sale of the only design of blades which fit the razor in some places or under certain circumstances price gouging is unlawful community qa search add new question

tailor your marketing pitch accordingly by mandy porta  comments credit getty images given the current state of the economy having a welldefined target market is more important than ever no one can afford to target everyone small businesses can effectively compete with large companies by targeting a niche market many businesses say they target anyone interested in my services some say they target smallbusiness owners homeowners or stayathome moms all of these targets are too general targeting a specific market does not mean that you are excluding people who do not fit your criteria rather target marketing allows you to focus your marketing dollars and brand message on a specific market that is more likely to buy from you than other markets this is a much more affordable efficient and effective way to reach potential clients and generate business for example an interior design company could choose to market to homeowners between the ages of  and  with incomes of 0plus in baton rouge louisiana to define the market even further the company could choose to target only those interested in kitchen and bath remodeling and traditional styles this market could be broken down into two niches parents on the go and retiring baby boomers with a clearly defined target audience it is much easier to determine where and how to market your company here are some tips to help you define your target market look at your current customer base who are your current customers and why do they buy from you look for common characteristics and interests which ones bring in the most business it is very likely that other people like them could also benefit from your productservice dig deeper upselling dig deeper into your customer base check out your competition who are your competitors targeting who are their current customers dont go after the same market you may find a niche market that they are overlooking dig deeper in praise of niche marketing analyze your productservice write out a list of each feature of your product or service next to each feature list the benefits it provides and the benefits of those benefits for example a graphic designer offers highquality design services the benefit is a professional company image a professional image will attract more customers because they see the company as professional and trustworthy so ultimately the benefit of highquality design is gaining more customers and making more money once you have your benefits listed make a list of people who have a need that your benefit fulfills for example a graphic designer could choose to target businesses interested in increasing their client base while this is still too general you now have a base to start from dig deeper how to conduct market research choose specific demographics to target figure out not only who has a need for your product or service but also who is most likely to buy it think about the following factors age  location gender income level education level marital or family status occupation ethnic background dig deeper why demographics are crucial to your business consider the psychographics of your target psychographics are the more personal characteristics of a person including personality attitudes values interestshobbies lifestyles behavior determine how your product or service will fit into your targets lifestyle how and when will your target use the product what features are most appealing to your target what media does your target turn to for information does your target read the newspaper search online or attend particular events dig deeper understanding how your customers think evaluate your decision once youve decided on a target market be sure to consider these questions are there enough people who fit my criteria will my target really benefit from my productservice will they see a need for it do i understand what drives my target to make decisions can they afford my productservice can i reach them with my message are they easily accessible dont break down your target too far remember you can have more than one niche market consider if your marketing message should be different for each niche if you can reach both niches effectively with the same message then maybe you have broken down your market too far also if you find there are only 0 people that fit all of your criteria maybe you should reevaluate your target the trick is to find that perfect balance you may be asking how do i find all this information try searching online for research others have done on your target search for magazine articles and blogs that talk about or to your target market search for blogs and forums where people in your target market communicate their opinions look for survey results or consider conducting a survey of your own ask your current customers for feedback defining your target market is the hard part once you know who you are targeting it is much easier to figure out which media you can use to reach them and what marketing messages will resonate with them instead of sending direct mail to everyone in your zip code you can send it only to those who fit your criteria save money and get a better return on investment by defining your target audience dig deeper how to find new customers and increase sales   additional resources pew internet publishes reports regarding internet use
