on many fronts it began with a doubledigit plunge in stock markets and ended with a sixweek equity rally fears of rising interest rates and the political surprises of the brexit vote and donald trump’s victory spilled over into financial markets during the year amid the tumult global stocks overall performed well us stocks again took the lead with largercap us stocks gaining  and smallercap us stocks surging  developed international stocks returned just  in usdollar terms european stocks in particular continued to face headwinds falling  on the year in both cases the strength of the us dollar weighed on returns the overall us bond market gained  for the year but that hid a  tumble during the fourth quarter as rising interest rates resulted in the worst quarterly performance for bonds in  years expectations for rising inflation along with the federal reserve’s december decision to raise interest rates for the first time since august  further contributed to falling bond prices in constructing globally diversified portfolios there will be periods of time when comparisons to more concentrated portfolios andor specific assets seem unfavorable as asset classes that are temporarily out of favor weigh on overall results while some areas of the markets delivered strong performance this year others faltered since no one can predict ahead of time which market sectors will do well or for how long it pays to own a wide selection of investments with attractive and differing risk and return drivers if you would like to discuss recent market events or have questions
