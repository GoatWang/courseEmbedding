desert buttes mountains and cactus plants all around us mules work well for us as they can tolerate the heat better than most horses and their water consumption is a tad easier to manage as well as you may know mules are the animals of choice for grand canyon trips not only because they are known to be sure footed but also because they can perform the job in the hot and dry conditionswe are a working ranch our business is mules so while we have some outstanding riding opportunities we are not open to the public for trail access we train mules to pack drive and ride and our lands are used

my wonderful wife susan we have been together following our dreams since  susan is the bookkeeper and “party planner” code for event coordinator for our pack trips she also watches over many of the day to day details of the ranch she is the real “trail boss” truth be told all kidding aside she is as passionate about our work as i am and our work is truly a labor of loveso long story short if you
