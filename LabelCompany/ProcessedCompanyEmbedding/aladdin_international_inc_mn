financial information see the financial statements included in this annual report balance sheet data   cash     total assets     total liabilities     shareholders equity deficit      the following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included herein our operating results for the years ended june   and  are summarized as follows years ended june    revenue     operating expenses   net loss       revenues we have not earned any revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and june   we are presently in the development stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that we begin earning revenues expenses our expenses for the years ended june   and  are outlined in the table below years ended june    audit fees    professional fees   other   total expenses     professional fees the professional fees for the fiscal year ended june   and june   were  and  respectively professional fees include our accounting expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of our financial statements professional fees that we pay to our legal counsel and other professional fees the increase in our audit fees and

the year ended june   going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america which contemplates continuation of the company as a going concern however the company has no business operations and has recurring losses which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in view of these matters realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn is dependent upon the companys ability to meet its financial requirements raise additional capital and the success of its future operations the financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party there is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future plan of operation at this time the companys purpose is to seek investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an exchange act registered corporation the company will not restrict its search to any specific business industry or geographical location and the company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature this discussion of the proposed business is intentionally general and is not meant to be restrictive of the companys virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the company has nominal assets and limited financial resources see financial statements and supplementary data this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to shareholders of the company because it will not permit the company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another the company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets to develop a new product or service or for other corporate purposes the company may acquire assets and establish whollyowned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries however there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company management intends to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations of the companys officers and directors in analyzing prospective business opportunities management will consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements history of operations if any prospects for the future nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management the potential for further research development or exploration specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company the potential for growth or expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition of acceptance of products services or trades name identification and other relevant factors the company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained prior to the closing of the proposed transaction it is anticipated that the company will require approximately  during the next  months to implement its business plan described herein the company has limited capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses it is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the company the company has not identified any alternative

statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america which contemplates continuation of the company as a going concern it is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the company it is anticipated that the company will require approximately  during the next  months to implement its business plan as of march   the company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses in view of these matters realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn is dependent upon the companys ability to meet its financial requirements raise additional capital and the success of its future operations the financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party there is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future    as of march   there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap on the basis that the company will continue as a going concern due to the uncertainty of the companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties the preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments including those described below we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended june   filed on october   annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements a related party debt convertible notes occasionally we obtain financing from related parties in the form of notes payable convertible into shares of our common stock we analyze the terms of such convertible notes payable to determine their accounting treatment including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable and warrants as debt equity or mezzanine temporary equity we include the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of convertible notes payable in the discount to notes payable which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method  we also estimate the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds the proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of our common stock as of the date of issuance convertible notes to related parties are separately identified in our financial statements nonconvertible notes the company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable and are identified in our financial statements we also disclose significant terms of all transactions with related parties offbalance sheet arrangements we do not

procedures our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk as of march   our ceo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q disclosure controls and procedure include without limitations controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure in the reports filed with the securities and exchange commission based on such evaluation our ceo has concluded that as of march   the disclosure controls and procedure of the company were effective as of march   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commissions  internal control  integrated framework and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of march   management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items   and  above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods    managements remediation initiatives in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board we anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially if not fully implemented by the end of fiscal year  additionally we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year  changes in internal controls over financial reporting except the above there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that

transaction postclosing michael friess resigned as a director effective on the tenth day following the companys mailing of this information statement on schedule f to its shareholders the effective date which occurred on july   immediately after the closing the shares acquired by the purchaser comprised  of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company    the company has opted to become a blank check company and to further engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions at this time the companys purpose is to seek investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an exchange act registered corporation the company has opted to register its common stock pursuant to section g of the securities exchange act of  the exchange act in an effort to maximize shareholder value the best use and primary attraction of the company as a merger partner or acquisition vehicle will be its status as a reporting public company any business combination or transaction is expected to result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the company the proposed business activities described herein classify the company as a blank check company many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any additional offerings of the companys securities either debt or equity until such time as the company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein at this time the companys purpose is to seek investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an exchange act registered corporation the company will not restrict its search to any specific business industry or geographical location and the company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature this discussion of the proposed business is intentionally general and is not meant to be restrictive of the companys virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the company has nominal assets and limited financial resources this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to shareholders of the company because it will not permit the company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another the company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets to develop a new product or service or for other corporate purposes the company may acquire assets and establish whollyowned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries however there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful the company intends to advertise and promote the company privately the company has not yet prepared any notices or advertisements the company anticipates that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky due to general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees providing liquidity subject to restrictions of applicable statutes for all shareholders and other factors the company has little or no capital with which to provide the owners of business opportunities with any significant cash or other assets however management believes the company will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in a publicly registered company without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering the owners of the business opportunities will however incur significant legal and accounting costs in connection with the acquisition of a business opportunity including the costs of preparing form  ks ks and qs agreements and related reports and documents the exchange act specifically requires that any merger or acquisition candidate comply with all applicable reporting requirements which include providing audited financial statements to be included within the numerous filings relevant to complying with the exchange act the officers and directors of the company have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data which would support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity    the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officer and director of the company management intends to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations of the companys officer and director in analyzing prospective business opportunities management will consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements history of operations if any prospects for the future nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management the potential for further research development or exploration specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company the potential for growth or expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition of acceptance of products services or trades name identification and other relevant factors the company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained prior to the closing of the proposed transaction the company will not restrict its search for any specific kind of firms but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its corporate life it is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the company may become engaged in that such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer the company may also at its discretion obtain funds in one or more private placements to be used to finance and consummate a merger or acquisition of a business opportunity on october   kai ming zhao accepted an offer prescribed

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america which contemplates continuation of the company as a going concern it is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the company it is anticipated that the company will require approximately  during the next  months to implement its business plan as of december   the company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses in view of these matters realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn is dependent upon the companys ability to meet its financial requirements raise additional capital and the success of its future operations the financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party there is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future as of december   there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap on the basis that the company will continue as a going concern due to the uncertainty of the companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties the preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments including those described below we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended june   filed on october   annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements a related party debt convertible notes the company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the companys common stock the company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in asc  debt with conversion and other options asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity asc  derivatives and hedging  contracts in entitys own equity eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entitys own stock and asu  interestimputation of interest subtopic  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs    the terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt equity or mezzanine temporary equity the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method the companys management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds the proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the companys common stock as of the date of

information required by this item as it is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule f   item   controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule ae under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in connection with the preparation of this annual report on form k an evaluation was carried out by management with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act as of december   based on that evaluation management concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording processing summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms changes in internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended december   that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of managements last evaluation    managements report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of  we have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of december   using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso internal control  intergrated framework as a basis for our assessment because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the companys ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected in the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting we identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  the company has inadequate staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping and accounting operations of our company the relatively small number of employees who have bookkeeping and accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system the inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews  the company has installed accounting software that does not prevent erroneous or unauthorized changes to previous reporting periods and does not provide an adequate audit trail of entries made in the accounting software  the company has a limited corporate governance structure our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the board of directors none of whom are independent under applicable standards we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee because our board of directors only meets periodically throughout the year some of our corporate governance functions are not performed concurrent or timely with the underlying transactions including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those transactions  certain internal controls were not fully operating and effective in a manner to effectively support the requirements of the financial reporting and periodend close process principally this related to the controls and procedures surrounding the consistent completion review and approval of key balance sheet account analyses and reconciliations material errors were corrected in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended june   and the three months ended september   it is reasonably possible that if not remediated these control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement of the companys financial statements in a future annual or interim period management is aware of these issues and is planning to implement more stringent controls in the future as we are not aware of any instance in which the company failed to identify or resolve a disclosure matter or failed to perform a timely and effective review we determined that the addition of personnel to our bookkeeping and accounting operations is not an efficient use of our resources at this time and not in the interest of shareholders because of the above condition the companys internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of december      part ii  other information   item   legal proceedings none   item a risk factors   not applicable to a smaller reporting company item

obtaining further financing our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties the preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments including those described below we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances these

classification of the convertible notes payable and warrants as debt equity or mezzanine temporary equity we include the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of convertible notes payable in the discount to notes payable which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method  we also estimate the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds the proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible

the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements    because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk as of march   our ceo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q disclosure controls and procedure include without limitations controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure in the reports filed with the securities and exchange commission based on such evaluation our ceo has concluded that as of march   the disclosure controls and procedure of the company were effective as of march   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commissions  internal control  integrated framework and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of march   management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items   and  above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods managements remediation initiatives in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board we anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially if not fully implemented by the end of fiscal year  additionally we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year  changes in internal controls over financial reporting except the above there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this
