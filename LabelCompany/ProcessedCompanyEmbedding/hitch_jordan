hitches torklift hitches curt hitches trailer hitch information videoshow to tow a trailertoday we are going to review the components needed to pull a trailer basically this video is designed for somebody who just decided they have a need for a trailer so we will cover all the components in the most basic form so you know exactly how to update your vehicle what we are going to do is start from the truck and work our way back to the trailer first off we are going to show you the hitch itself all vehicles require a hitch to pull a trailer what this device does is makes an attaching point on the frame of the vehicle or body components and transmits the forces from the trailer to this one point here this point here is the receiver part consequently this hitch is called a receiver hitch because this hitch can receive a draw bar or also called a ball mount it is held in place by this pin which we just ed and this clip holds it in place there are more fancier pins like locking pins but that is the basic thing you need right there to get the job done cleaning weld nuts for trailer hitch installationokay as you can see here on the drivers side our weld nut has a lot of corrosion built up in there and when we try to install our  millimeter bolt is not wanting to start at all in fact it almost seems like the bolt is too big for the weld nut it is a common misconception again when the weld nuts got a lot of build up in there class iii trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewtraditionally a class iii receiver hitch is good for trailers up to  pounds and  pounds tongue weight there are a few different variances from that well show you that here in a second again were going to start with the stickers and show you the differences as you can see here the max gross trailer weight is  pounds as we discussed the tongue weight looks to be  pounds again about percent of your trailer weight on the other side of the class iii you will see a sticker for weight distribution that is a specification when you use a device that goes in between the truck and the trailer that takes up the tongue weight what it does is distributes the weight between the truck and the trailer and allows you to carry a heavier weight as far as a class iii hitch is concerned that increases the rating the hitch can handle lowering exhaust example for trailer hitch installationthe first step to do is to lower the exhaust and we will do that by taking off the rubber hangers on the front and back and there is one hidden in the back class ii trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewnow well move on to a class ii receiver hitch well cover the weights on the sticker and cover a couple of differences on the receiver tube itself you see here it says weight carrying ballmount that means the ballmount going into the receiver and the ball that is what that means you see here where it says weight distribution that is a separate device that allows you to carry heavier weights that does not really apply to class ii receiver hitches again by itself on the hitch its rated for  pounds that is the total weight the tongue weight is listed at  pounds on the details of the class ii hitch there is not too many details on it compared to a class one basically all class ii hitches have this ring that goes around the end of the tube this is so at a quick glance you are working with a class ii class i trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewwere going to start off with this example here which is a class i hitch class i means this hitch is good for trailers up to  pounds what were going to show you over here is the sticker which shows the different weights and capacities involved well show you what those mean as you can see by the sticker here were going to show you some notes on it these stickers will apply to any class hitch that you come across once you figure out what this means you are home free starting here at max gross trailer weight which shows  pounds so that means the total weight you can pull with your trailer for example if your load on your trailer is  pounds you have  pounds of weight to put on it so it remains at a safe capacity for this hitch moving on to this next number which is max gross tongue weight it shows  pounds there how to clean weld nutsa common problem that we run into with a lot of our vehicles that have existing weld nuts in the bottom of the frame is that when you go to try to put a bolt in them you have an excessive amount of road grime or rust built up in there and when you go to put your bolt inside the weld nuts you find not only does it not want to thread but it also appears that the bolt is too big for the weld nut the first thing that typically comes to mind is that the bolts that i received are too big and  percent of the time this is not the case what we have actually got here is an excessive amount of rust and debris built up in the weld nuts that are preventing the bolt from starting we are going to show you how to get those thoroughly cleaned out so that we can not only get our bolt started but to get it threaded completely into the weld nut how to make a thread taptoday we are going to show you a cheat in some cases you are going to have a hitch that uses threaded holes in the bottom of the frame those holes are going to be probably corroded up within a few years of the vehicle being on the road with dirt grime salt corrosion you name it is probably in there inside the fine thread what you want to do is clean out the threads probably with an existing hitch bolt if it is lightly corroded and you can probably work it in and out a few times and do that drilling a spare tire pan for a trailer hitch installationwhat we will do next is tighten this down just enough to snug it to hold it in place and then we will see where to drill or holes out using the hitch as a template we will use the hitch as a template to drill or holes so we will just use a drill and let the hitch do the work for us we will punch right through this thin metal with a halfinch bit lowering exhaust hangersalright we will get started by lowering the exhaust these rubber hangers here will need lubricant sprayed on them to make it easier to get them off before we lower the exhaust we are actually going to put a safety strap underneath here so we can control the exhaust as we lower it see how we can control itweld nut removal and replacement reviewso you are in the middle of doing your hitch installation and you are in the process of taking out one of your existing factory bolts in the process you find that the bolt is not coming out due to the fact that the weld nut inside the frame has broken we are just going to go ahead and show you a couple of things you can do to not only get the bolt out of the way but to also go ahead and continue on to be able to put your hitch in position without the weld nut welded inside the frame the first thing that we obviously need to do is go ahead and get the bolt out of here there are a couple of different ways you can do this you can take a chisel is you have one large and strong enough to do so and possible grind the head of the bolt off or you can actually take a torch and torch it off and that is actually what we are going to do on this application here i am going to try to get most or as much of the head of the bolt off as i can and we will take and push the remaining section of the boltweld nut combination up inside the frame handle nut demonstrationtoday we are going to show you the proper operation of a handle nut basically a lot of hitch installs will use this type of device here you can manipulate this handle any way you want to to run this nut into an area that has a tight fit you can bend this at will basically just take it like this and bend it and then put another hook into it and make a handle like that and you can thread it into the frame where you can actually run your bolt through the bottom of it all right and now we will go ahead actually and install this handle nut on a typical applicationdrilling to enlarge a frame hole for hitch installon this hitch we have to enlarge this hole to a halfinch and there is one on the opposite side we have to do the same thing with faq trailer hitch exhaust rattletoday on our  lincoln mkx were going to address the exhaust rattle issue there are a couple of reasons for occasional contact between hitch and exhaust one the manufacturers have loose tolerances from mounting the hangers that suspend exhaust systems final placement of the exhaust can vary slightly from vehicle to vehicle the flexibility of rubber isolator connecting exhaust hanger to the vehicle frame allows for more movement of the exhaust system relative to other vehicle components an isolator can also stretch over timehitch class receiver sizes faqtoday were going to go ahead and review the various classes of hitches starting from the smallest working our way up to the largestsome good terms to know about receiver hitches tongue weight thats the amount of weight of the trailer thats pushing down on the hitch ball trailer weight will be a larger number and that will include the weight of your trailer plus whatever is on top of it or in itwhen you get to twoinch receivers you can use whats called weight distribution which this is a separate device that goes between the trailer hitch and the trailer it takes tongue weight picks it up and what it does it distributes that weight over the axles of the truck and the trailertrailer hitch videosbest  bmw x hitch optionscurt trailer hitch

information videoshow to tow a trailertoday we are going to review the components needed to pull a trailer basically this video is designed for somebody who just decided they have a need for a trailer so we will cover all the components in the most basic form so you know exactly how to update your vehicle what we are going to do is start from the truck and work our way back to the trailer first off we are going to show you the hitch itself all vehicles require a hitch to pull a trailer what this device does is makes an attaching point on the frame of the vehicle or body components and transmits the forces from the trailer to this one point here this point here is the receiver part consequently this hitch is called a receiver hitch because this hitch can receive a draw bar or also called a ball mount it is held in place by this pin which we just ed and this clip holds it in place there are more fancier pins like locking pins but that is the basic thing you need right there to get the job done cleaning weld nuts for trailer hitch installationokay as you can see here on the drivers side our weld nut has a lot of corrosion built up in there and when we try to install our  millimeter bolt is not wanting to start at all in fact it almost seems like the bolt is too big for the weld nut it is a common misconception again when the weld nuts got a lot of build up in there class iii trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewtraditionally a class iii receiver hitch is good for trailers up to  pounds and  pounds tongue weight there are a few different variances from that well show you that here in a second again were going to start with the stickers and show you the differences as you can see here the max gross trailer weight is  pounds as we discussed the tongue weight looks to be  pounds again about percent of your trailer weight on the other side of the class iii you will see a sticker for weight distribution that is a specification when you use a device that goes in between the truck and the trailer that takes up the tongue weight what it does is distributes the weight between the truck and the trailer and allows you to carry a heavier weight as far as a class iii hitch is concerned that increases the rating the hitch can handle lowering exhaust example for trailer hitch installationthe first step to do is to lower the exhaust and we will do that by taking off the rubber hangers on the front and back and there is one hidden in the back class ii trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewnow well move on to a class ii receiver hitch well cover the weights on the sticker and cover a couple of differences on the receiver tube itself you see here it says weight carrying ballmount that means the ballmount going into the receiver and the ball that is what that means you see here where it says weight distribution that is a separate device that allows you to carry heavier weights that does not really apply to class ii receiver hitches again by itself on the hitch its rated for  pounds that is the total weight the tongue weight is listed at  pounds on the details of the class ii hitch there is not too many details on it compared to a class one basically all class ii hitches have this ring that goes around the end of the tube this is so at a quick glance you are working with a class ii class i trailer hitch and weight capacities reviewwere going to start off with this example here which is a class i hitch class i means this hitch is good for trailers up to  pounds what were going to show you over here is the sticker which shows the different weights and capacities involved well show you what those mean as you can see by the sticker here were going to show you some notes on it these stickers will apply to any class hitch that you come across once you figure out what this means you are home free starting here at max gross trailer weight which shows  pounds so that means the total weight you can pull with your trailer for example if your load on your trailer is  pounds you have  pounds of weight to put on it so it remains at a safe capacity for this hitch moving on to this next number which is max gross tongue weight it shows  pounds there how to clean weld nutsa common problem that we run into with a lot of our vehicles that have existing weld nuts in the bottom of the frame is that when you go to try to put a bolt in them you have an excessive amount of road grime or rust built up in there and when you go to put your bolt inside the weld nuts you find not only does it not want to thread but it also appears that the bolt is too big for the weld nut the first thing that typically comes to mind is that the bolts that i received are too big and  percent of the time this is not the case what we have actually got here is an excessive amount of rust and debris built up in the weld nuts that are preventing the bolt from starting we are going to show you how to get those thoroughly cleaned out so that we can not only get our bolt started but to get it threaded completely into the weld nut how to make a thread taptoday we are going to show you a cheat in some cases you are going to have a hitch that uses threaded holes in the bottom of the frame those holes are going to be probably corroded up within a few years of the vehicle being on the road with dirt grime salt corrosion you name it is probably in there inside the fine thread what you want to do is clean out the threads probably with an existing hitch bolt if it is lightly corroded and you can probably work it in and out a few times and do that drilling a spare tire pan for a trailer hitch installationwhat we will do next is tighten this down just enough to snug it to hold it in place and then we will see where to drill or holes out using the hitch as a template we will use the hitch as a template to drill or holes so we will just use a drill and let the hitch do the work for us we will punch right through this thin metal with a halfinch bit lowering exhaust hangersalright we will get started by lowering the exhaust these rubber hangers here will need lubricant sprayed on them to make it easier to get them off before we lower the exhaust we are actually going to put a safety strap underneath here so we can control the exhaust as we lower it see how we can control itweld nut removal and replacement reviewso you are in the middle of doing your hitch installation and you are in the process of taking out one of your existing factory bolts in the process you find that the bolt is not coming out due to the fact that the weld nut inside the frame has broken we are just going to go ahead and show you a couple of things you can do to not only get the bolt out of the way but to also go ahead and continue on to be able to put your hitch in position without the weld nut welded inside the frame the first thing that we obviously need to do is go ahead and get the bolt out of here there are a couple of different ways you can do this you can take a chisel is you have one large and strong enough to do so and possible grind the head of the bolt off or you can actually take a torch and torch it off and that is actually what we are going to do on this application here i am going to try to get most or as much of the head of the bolt off as i can and we will take and push the remaining section of the boltweld nut combination up inside the frame handle nut demonstrationtoday we are going to show you the proper operation of a handle nut basically a lot of hitch installs will use this type of device here you can manipulate this handle any way you want to to run this nut into an area that has a tight fit you can bend this at will basically just take it like this and bend it and then put another hook into it and make a handle like that and you can thread it into the frame where you can actually run your bolt through the bottom of it all right and now we will go ahead actually and install this handle nut on a typical applicationdrilling to enlarge a frame hole for hitch installon this hitch we have to enlarge this hole to a halfinch and there is one on the opposite side we have to do the same thing with faq trailer hitch exhaust rattletoday on our  lincoln mkx were going to address the exhaust rattle issue there are a couple of reasons for occasional contact between hitch and exhaust one the manufacturers have loose tolerances from mounting the hangers that suspend exhaust systems final placement of the exhaust can vary slightly from vehicle to vehicle the flexibility of rubber isolator connecting exhaust hanger to the vehicle frame allows for more movement of the exhaust system relative to other vehicle components an isolator can also stretch over timehitch class receiver sizes faqtoday were going to go ahead and review the various classes of hitches starting from the smallest working our way up to the largestsome good terms to know about receiver hitches tongue weight thats the amount of weight of the trailer thats pushing down on the hitch ball trailer weight will be a larger number and that will include the weight of your trailer plus whatever is on top of it or in itwhen you get to twoinch receivers you can use whats called weight distribution which this is a separate device that goes between the trailer hitch and the trailer it takes tongue weight picks it up and what it does it distributes that weight over the axles of the truck and the trailertrailer hitch videosbest  bmw x hitch optionscurt trailer hitch installation   mazda cxtrailer hitch installation
