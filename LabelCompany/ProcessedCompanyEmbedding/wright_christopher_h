our bible are themselves the product of and witness to the ultimate mission of god the bible renders to us the story of gods mission through gods people in their engagement with gods world for the sake of the whole of gods creation the bible is the drama of this god of purpose engaged in the mission of achieving that purpose universally embracing past present and future israel and the nations life the universe and everything and with its centre focus climax and completion in jesus christ mission is not just one of a list of things that the bible happens to talk about only a bit more urgently than some mission is in that muchabused phrase what its all about” ― christopher jh wright tags bible mission  likes like “evil and sin weave their way into every aspect of god’s creation and

almost second nature for christians to call god father jesus taught his followers as much although for them it was apparently a surprising practice the worshiping community of the old testament used fatherly images for understanding gods character and actions but father was not a common way for believers to address god in knowing god the father through the old testament christopher wright explores in depth the images that pervade the biblical narratives psalms and prophetic texts of the old testament god is acknowledged as tender yet terrifying challenging to the nations and yet intimately personal offering loving care provision discipline and forgiveness this is the god whom jesus knew and whom we can know as father such knowledge of god is far from merely devotional or doctrinal but governs our worldview personal and social ethics and expectations of the future author bio▼▲ christopher j h wright phd cambridge is international ministries director of the langham partnership providing literature scholarships and preaching training for pastors in majority world churches and seminaries he has written many books including commentaries on deuteronomy jeremiah lamentations and ezekiel    and an ordained priest in the church of england chris spent five years teaching the old testament at union biblical seminary in india and thirteen years as academic dean and then principal of all nations christian college an international training center for crosscultural mission in england he was chair of the lausanne theology working group from  and the chief architect of the cape town commitment from the third lausanne congress  editorial reviews▼▲ the reviewer commends it as a volume that will reward careful readers willing to reflect on its authors numerous perceptive insights wright capably demonstrates proper theological methodology while performing limied exegetical evaluation of the biblical text demonstrating a biblical theological approach that can be grasped by the common reader an experience of biblical theology from which any believer can benefit here is theology that feeds the soul in an immediate way without getting sentimental pastors and church members will be rewarded in pocking up this work and meditating on the various topics that fill out a christian understanding of who god is as our father i had originally expected an academic treatment of god the father in the old testament ot with many references to hebrew grammar but this is not what i got what i did get was a very easy to read somewhat devotional treatment of god as father in the ot a great starting point for sermons on the nature of god and his will product reviews▼▲ be the first to write a review write review ask a question▼▲ have a question about

wright has been one of the most significant writers on old testament ethics over recent decades in a unique way he combines commitment to listening openly to the old testament as scripture

fuller theological seminary after thirty years research and writing on old testament ethics chris wright has brought his conclusions together in this comprehensive and readable textbook it is truly a

remains to be seen but i cant imagine future discussion of the issue ignoring the wellthought out arguments laid out in this book phil sumpter chrisendom editorial reviews▼▲ whether wrights
