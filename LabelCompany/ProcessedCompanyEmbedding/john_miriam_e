facebook  share   tweet   shares story updates    john bonano  richmond va the goalhelp two young designers john and miriam capture and create art as they undertake a cross country road trip to refine their craft while embracing their absolute love for design as two passionate photographers and artists we have decided to escape the world for a while with the goal of returning home and hosting an art exhibition where proceeds from the selling of our work will be donated to our friends at mobstorefront ​ please take a look and thanks so much for checking us outwe are space explorersas children this phrase was as undeniable as any we were all on a journey to explore space and time as we jumped into life attempting to find beauty in the unknown unfortunately as life passes this truth becomes less and less self evident as adults and as reality builds we must more frequently resort to exploring less while remembering more surrounding ourselves with reminders of our past explorations our homes filled with objects we once made places we once visited and sites we once saw telling stories of our past explorations through artifacts captured from our own lenses and created by our own hands but now just memories and products removed from the spaces in which they were once createdthe inherent beauty in interpreting these modern day trends is that all hope may not be lost one day reality will decide to slow itself down and the objects and memories once captured will be the catalyst to drive new exploration and innovation rather then surrounding ourselves with memories and reminders of our past we for some unknown reason will act on impulse and rebel as we begin to surround ourselves with life led through exploration humans have not yet and will never lose their ability to explore we are all space explorersthe exhibition  giving backupon their arrival back from their long  journey john and miriam plan to compile refine and organize their best pieces into an exhibition titled drive for design the goal purpose of this exhibition is to both showcase the beauty that can so easily be found in our country but to also remind others that although terrifying and unpredictable taking a leap of faith can lead to great happiness and beauty they hope to create new rebels and new explorers that will embrace their uncertainties slow their lives down just enough and find happiness worth cherishing for the exhibition john and miriam plan on printing as many photographs as they can afford if their financial goal of  is met a portion of the remaining proceeds will be donated to our good friends at mobstorefront the place where john and miriam first thought up this whole dream mob is an interdiciplnary design studio where vcuarts students work in group projects to bring good quality design to the richmond community through a partnership with storefront   the money will be used to purchase new materials help with rent for the studio space as well as provide a hopeful expansion of their volunteering staffthe back storyjohn and miriam met while going to school at virginia commonwealth university in richmond virginia at the time john was a museum exhibit designer and was recruited by mobstorefront to be a mentor for a group of seniors working on an exhibit design project for the institute for contemporary art miriam just so happened to be one of the students on this project and the rest was history keeping in touch here and there over the past year they randomly contacted each other to grab coffee and miriam shared her desires to break free and explore the world on a cross country adventure john having recently relocated to raleigh nc and in somewhat of a crisis himself decided he would join and here we are today two friends a car and
