vergine del sole the sun virgin is a dramma serio which domenico cimarosa wrote for performance at the russian court during his tenure in st petersburg as maestro di cappella the plot by ferdinando moretti revolves around the invasion of peru after the mexican conquest by the spanish a courageous soldier alonso molina outraged by the barbarian acts of the spanish leader pizzaro has abandoned the spanish army and fled to quito to warn the king ataliba and his sister aliloe of their impending dangerwelcomed by the king and made a commander of his army alonso falls in love with idalide the daughter of palmoro a nobleman of the kingmuch later invited to the temple of the sun alonso is horrified to discover that his beloved idalide has been ordered by antique rule to be one of the virgins of the gods and discovers her at the sacrificial altar as the high priest pronounces incantations a volcano erupts followed by an earthquake more afraid for idalide than for himself alonso enters the crumbling temple and rescues his beloved in addition to performances in st petersburg at both the hermitage theatre where it probably had its prima in  and at the kamenniy theatre on  october  the opera was produced at teatro zagnoni in bologna on  february  in warsaw on  july  brescia in  and madrid on  november  it was heard in lisbon on  july  and again at st petersburg in  the most recent performance of record was at teatro valle in rome during may of  because of the operas dramatic story line cimarosa made full use of the st petersburg orchestra scoring the overtures for pairs of flutes oboes bassoons and horns in addition to timpani and strings the exotic nature of the plot led the composer to write an overture much more chromatic and dramatic than anything he had written before in addition he included loud bursts of strings and timpani possibly to suggest the forthcoming volcanic eruption and earthquake his unusual use of the timpani suggests possibly the native peruvian sacrificial drums this edition is based on the composers holograph score which is today preserved in the library of the conservatorio di musica s pietro a majella naples under the shelfmark rari  as is the case with all cimarosas autograph material the overture to la vergine del sole shows signs of having been composed at breakneck speed every conceivable notational shortcut is taken and his placement of articulation and dynamic markings is erratic it has been necessary therefore to frequently interpret the composers intentions and even at times to impose an editorial solution where his own thoughts are not clear the timpani part is notated at pitch whereas the horns are written more conventionally in c in the autograph in making sense of cimarosas score the style and notation of articulation and dynamic markings have been largely standardised throughout and where missing markings have been reconstructed from parallel passages these are indicated by the use of dotted slurs or brackets where appropriate obvious wrong notes have been corrected without comment editorial emendations with no authority from the source are placed within brackets nick rossi performance  june

down to business share on facebook share on twitter pinterest share on googleplus share on linkedin tumblr whatsapp share link share on googleplus share on linkedin tumblr whatsapp add to black book by christian barker april    am “marketing is very important” says the chairman of tom ford international domenico de sole “in luxury you have to have an aesthetic a vision for the brand however in the end the product is everything” photo by tom ford exclusive qa the boss of tom ford international discusses entrepreneurship persistence product quality pragmatic creativity and the importance of thinking big christian barker together you restored the fortunes of gucci and built the company into one of the world’s preeminent fashion groups and now you’ve established a multibilliondollar business in tom ford international suffice it to say your partnership with mr ford is one of the most distinguished and successful in luxury what is it about your personality and skillset that complements his personality and skillset domenico de sole we’ve known each other for a long time we’re very different but we have the same vision about what a brand ought to be and what the vision of the brand should be — we’re very disciplined in understanding especially the new company we launched tom ford and everybody wanted to buy the products — but we wanted to keep it very exclusive it’s a very complex universe but we share the same vision and the same desire i’m not a creative person so i don’t design one thing that helps me tom is a big persona in design and fashion creativity everybody thinks of tom as a creative director the reality is he’s a very astute and rational person and a very good businessperson it’s very easy to have common ground with tom because he really understands he understands business if you’re creative but not commercially aware and nobody wants to buy your product it’s useless the tom ford brand began with partnerships in eyewear in fragrances what was the strategy there it was the type of products that tom liked yes it was a good financial base for the company the key issue though was that tom liked them you can’t force the designer to design products that he or she has no feeling for it’s important to stay in an area that tom would be comfortable in that he really likes the quality level of all your products is stratospheric i’m wearing one of your private blend fragrances azure lime which i put on at am and that will still be lingering when i get home at pm your garments and accessories equally are superbly constructed it’s admirable when so many fashion brands are all ‘smoke and mirrors’ — a veneer of luxury and glamour masking ordinary products there are some businesses where marketing is very important in luxury you have to have an aesthetic a vision for the brand however in the end the product is everything of course the stores must be consistent and all that — but if you peel that back it’s the product you can spend billions in marketing but if the product is not consistent with the marketing you won’t sell you have to be clear about what the priority is tom has a great vision for the brand the tom ford suit is not only beautifully made but incredibly distinctive in its shape fit and details — a perfect melding of quality and aesthetics every great brand has to represent something there are a lot of brands that make suits but if we do suits like everyone else there is no raison d’être what tom did in creating the brand’s signature suit silhouette was very exciting — it’s fashionable and it’s exciting even i wear it i think you have to have a distinct look and distinct point of view otherwise nobody needed another brand to make nice suits one of the genius things about a tom ford suit is that its distinctive look pretty much functions as branding without a visible logo — i look at the lapels the proportions the nipped waist the heroic shoulders and i know it’s a tom ford suit do you think that’s something that’s going to work in asia where more blatant branding seems to prevail i think the asian market has become a lot more sophisticated in the last few years the brand is gaining much more traction menswear has always been strong in asia and we also have a very strong accessories market in this market accessories are the driver i’m very bullish about southeast asia with gucci it was a very good business once you put together a good brand and a strong local customer base it’s unbeatable mr ford recently stated his intention to grow the company into one of the five major luxury brands in the world as chairman the person responsible for overseeing that expansion does that breadth of ambition daunt you or does it excite you at gucci a long time ago a private equity firm owned the brand it was not public yet and i said to the head of the equity firm “we’re going to be bigger than chanel” he said “you’re crazy” at the end of the day you must have a great dream and great vision or else you’ll never succeed just a decade after founding the tom ford brand you’re now doing roughly a billion dollars in sales annually what advice would you give the founder of a startup who aspired to generating similar revenue within  years of launching their business my view is very simple — and that’s to stick it out in the early s before de sole was appointed president and ford creative director gucci had been run into the ground by the time we went public in  it was a really massive success i recall my daughter asking me how we turned things around and i said “winners never quit” i thought gucci would be a great company even though it was broke i always felt that if i stuck it out the brand could be resurrected and here we are now wwwtomfordcom  share on

at the trial of new york’s knoedler  company gallery as plaintiff domenico de sole spent a second day on the witness stand accusing defendant and art dealer ann freedman of fraud in the  sale of a painting for  million that was purported to be by mark rothko but turned out to be fake despite the massive scandal surrounding the demise of the gallery which shuttered abruptly in  following the discovery of an  milliondollar art forgery ring the current case is the only lawsuit connected to the disgraced gallery to come to trial to date in january  de sole and his wife eleanor finalized a deal to buy what they believed was an untitled  rothko the canvas in question made a surprise appearance in court on wednesday january  in conjunction with impassioned testimony from de sole recommended reading  key points to know about the knoedler trial which starts today by brian boucher jan   there were several heated moments on thursday as well with de sole and the defense attorney repeatedly butting heads as they attempted to speak over one another and judge gardelphe angrily reminding the defense to raise “questions not arguments” over and over de sole stressed that freedman “did all the talking” during the sale and “said the painting was beautiful a masterpiece” de sole was allegedly told that the rothko was one of two previously undiscovered works the other by jackson pollock that were part of a swiss collection he was told that the owner originally from mexico had purchased the works directly from the artist with the assistance of esteemed dealer and art adviser david herbert he had since died and his son who wished to remain anonymous was selling the art a key point in the case is whether freedman told anyone that she personally knew the fictional swiss collector or if a personal relationship between the two was only implied collector domenico de sole who is now chairman of sotheby’s board is suing over a mark rothko painting that turned out to be fakephoto courtesy of sothebyscom in fact the purported masterpieces were being sold by knoedler on behalf of long island art dealer glafira rosales she allegedly conspired with her boyfriend jose carlos bergantinos diaz and his brother jesus angel bergantinos diaz to pass off works from a chinese painter based in flushing queens as abstract expressionist originals by the likes of rothko pollock willem de kooning franz kline and robert motherwell in  after being indicted in a criminal case rosales cooperated with federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty she is awaiting sentencing the diaz brothers were arrested in spain in april  but have not yet been extradited to the us the forger pei shen qian who was reportedly paid minimal sums for his work has fled to china the defense seemed eager to pin the responsibility for determining the painting’s authenticity on the de soles and jim kelly the art dealer who helped arrange the transaction on the couple’s behalf recommended reading how the knoedler lawsuit transformed a ‘sublime’ rothko painting into junk by blake gopnik jan   the defense suggested that de sole should have been suspicious of the list of  rothko experts freedman had cited as having approved the work because it would seem like overkill to have more than a few people involved in such a process kelly effectively debunked this line of argument in the afternoon when he pointed out how impressed he was with freedman’s apparent due diligence “she had done such a good job organizing these experts” said kelly christopher rothko the artist’s son rothko expert david anfam and laila nasr a curator at the national gallery of art in washington dc were among those cited by freedman and were all announced as potential witnesses during the trial’s opening on monday eleanore and domenico de solephoto matteo pandoni joe schildnorn courtesy bfa another key to the defense’s case appeared to be whether or not de sole actually read the letter from freedman sent before the purchase to reiterate her claims about the painting’s provenance and authenticity de sole was unable to definitively recall having personally read the letter and had attested in a pretrial deposition that he had not “this forms such an important part of the lawsuit” the defense claimed for which the judge gardelphe quickly reprimanded him although the defense pointed out that freedman’s letter only claimed that the  experts had “viewed” the painting not that they had authenticated it both de sole and kelly were fairly certain that the dealer had used the word “authenticated” during their verbal conversations kelly noted that it was a “very stellar” list of experts telling the court “it meant to me that these people had attested to its authenticity that they agreed with ann” recommended reading potential witnesses revealed on first day of the knoedler forgery trial by eileen kinsella jan   the defense also attempted to draw a parallel between de sole’s job as a gucci executive and freedman’s role as an art dealer asking de sole if gucci salespeople were in the practice of assuring customers of the authenticity of their handbags “we never were in the business of selling fake products” said de sole “if there was a problem we’d give the customer a refund” just as a gucci customer would never expect the luxury brand to peddle knockoff goods de sole had full confidence in the good name of the knoedler gallery and freedman saying “it never crossed my mind that this was a fake painting” the defense also alluded to de sole’s law degree asking if he was a lawyer “no” said de sole “because i’ve been selling handbags for the last  years” much of the afternoon was dedicated to testimony from sharon flescher the executive director of the international foundation of art research ifar in late  the organization’s art authentication research service was asked by collector jack levy to authenticate a purported jackson pollock he had purchased from knoedler sharon flescherphoto paul bruinooge courtesy patrick mcmullan as soon as freedman got word of levy’s intentions she called up flescher to say that knoedler would once again be making an annual contribution to the organization—even though it was just nine days before the year’s end—and to talk about levy’s painting flescher’s notes from that conversation stated that freedman alluded to experts who had “blessed” the painting and claimed that it had passed to the swiss collector through filipinoborn artist alfonso ossorio a close friend and important patron of pollock’s with regard to this painting there was no mention of herbert ultimately ifar was unable to find any evidence to support freedman’s claims about the work’s provenance noting in its final report that it was “inconceivable” that they had missed documents that linked the painting to ossorio who had worked closely with those compiling the artist’s catalogue raisonné a panel of anonymous experts were ultimately split on whether or not the work appeared authentic with one quoted in the report as saying “it doesn’t ring true” although ifar did not definitively rule the levy pollock a fake the implication was certainly that its findings should have been enough to cast doubt on all of the works rosales was selling previous testimony had already covered fake richard diebenkorn paintings that came to knoedler via rosales and the doubts about their authenticity expressed by the artist’s daughter long before they were ever sold follow artnet news on facebook share sarah cascone associate

sued the nowshuttered knoedler  co gallery and its former president ann freedman for  million for the sale of a fake mark rothko painting kicked off on january  and was expected to last about four weeks the trial ended sooner than expected on sunday february  a little over two weeks after the plaintiffs began presenting their case with testimony and evidence freedman settled with the de soles just a few days later the gallery and its related holding company  holdings settled with the plaintiffs the de soles who testified independently were in court each day from the start of the trial however on the morning of wednesday february  when news of the settlement officially emerged neither was present with the agreement having been largely hammered out on the preceding afternoon february  domenico de sole had already departed for atlanta for board meetings by wednesday morning according to his attorney gregory clarick recommended reading top  takeaways from knoedler forgery trial by eileen kinsella  sarah cascone feb     a courtroom sketch of domenico de sole on the witness stand with the fake rothko painting he bought from knoedler galleryphoto elizabeth williams courtesy illustrated courtroom “i’m happy that we went to court” de sole told artnet news from his home in aspen this past weekend about the trial overall “as the truth was established” of more than  lawsuits filed so far over the sales of fake paintings that were brought to knoedler by long island dealer glafira rosales the de soles’ suit is the only one to make it to trial so far several more cases are pending recommended reading knoedler fraud trial settles by eileen kinsella feb   in late  after stories started to surface about fake paintings purportedly by robert motherwell and jackson pollock being sold through knoedler the de soles hired forensic analyst james martin to investigate their paintings “when jamie martin’s report which i believed and trusted came back that the rothko was a fake” said de sole “freedman knoedler and  holdings were insistent that this was not the case and that it was authentic my point of view was ‘fine if it’s authentic give me my  million back and i’ll walk away now you can sell this authentic rothko for more than twice as much  million or whatever and you can make a huge profit’ when they absolutely refused to do that i knew that one the rothko was definitely a fake and two they knew for sure that it was a fake” a painting sold by knoedler as a mark rothko that turned out to be fake freedman and knoedler’s attorneys initially disputed the fact that the paintings were fake offering theories about certain paint pigments being available to artists before being made commercially available or casting doubt on methods used to analyze the works indeed between the time that the de soles purchased the purported rothko from knoedler in  and the time that they subjected it to forensic analysis via james martin of orion analytical roughly seven years later the market for rothko along with the broader contemporary art market had soared for instance in  at christie’s new york a  rothko painting white center yellow pink and lavender on rose shattered previous price levels when it sold for  million the following year also at christie’s a  rothko no  sold for  million rothko’s prices have risen even higher in the ensuing years in  a new record of  million for orange red yellow  was set at christie’s new york this past may another painting no   sold for  million at christie’s new york establishing the second highest auction price for the artist ever to date according to the artnet price database seven rothko paintings have been sold at auction for more than  million each two dozen works have sold for more than  million each

fragrance and footwear he is a lawyer by training but made the transition to the fashion business when gucci — one of his clients — hired him to join the company that was in  over the next  years until his departure from gucci in  he engineered a remarkable turnaround saving the company from hostile suitors and acquiring such key brands as yves saint laurent and alexander mcqueen indeed in the fashion world the standard phrase for managing a successful turnaround has become “doing a gucci” knowledgewharton asked de sole to talk about the fashion business in a down economy the consumer mentality leadership and how he has managed to be so successful in what might be considered a turbulent industry an edited transcript of the conversation follows knowledgewharton thank you for joining us domenico de sole you’re welcome knowledgewharton my questions to you a year ago would have been very different than they are today domenico de sole i’m sure knowledgewharton given what’s going on in the economy in general — and in the fashion business in particular — how’s business today and what strategies are you adopting to minimize the downturn de sole business — i’m talking about in general — is very difficult for all the luxury companies they have been through an obviously huge crisis last fall that is continuing i have been in the business a long time and i have never seen anything that was so deep and so worldwide asia is still working reasonably well china is still growing hong kong is still growing but every other country has had very difficult times business has been very very weak there are a lot of factors — obviously the general economic situation is one japan’s economy has been very difficult for a long time now and this year particularly so i was in japan last week and it was all over the press that exports in japan have declined  in the last quarter so you can imagine how hard it is for the economy domenico de sole chairman of tom ford international shares his perspective on the fashion business in a down economy in the united states it is a combination of factors impacting the luxury industry the first one is certainly the general economic situation the financial meltdown of this fall but on top of that there is another factor occurring in the united states at the beginning of november last year one department store in particular that carries a lot of luxury brands suddenly went on sale a very radical approach marking everything down  this created a very complex situation because the whole fashion business — and all the great luxury companies — have stores in new york so we were confronted with a very complicated situation some followed the lead and marked down products in a way which was really unprecedented obviously it’s very difficult to tell your consumers now that in the spring season products are fullprice that they are supposed to buy at fullprice something they were giving away three months ago so i think in the united states there is an added factor that is creating a difficult time for luxury brands but business is difficult everywhere as i said with the exception of china and hong kong korea actually is doing reasonably well because the won has depreciated so there are a lot of tourists who go to korea to buy luxury goods but by and large it’s a very difficult climate i sense and actually i believe that  is going to be a very very difficult year i doubt that there’s going to be a recovery in  and i think we probably will continue to have difficult times in  with the situation improving towards the end of  so i have a rather realistic — i wouldn’t say pessimistic — view however there are really a lot of schools of thought about the long term  i’ve been around for a long time and i always have always heard after horrible situations — like economic depressions or events like  — i’ve always heard “things have changed forever” i just don’t believe it i think that consumers — people — forget it’s human nature people are optimistic — most of them — by nature so i am convinced that obviously we will do quite well the luxury industry will come back the real question that nobody knows the answer to is how long it’s going to take nobody knows my guess is that it’s going to take some time but long term i’m quite optimistic knowledgewharton what kind of strategy would you suggest a luxury goods company follow knowledgewharton high school de sole the strategy for all luxury goods — and i think excellent managers understand this strategy — should be the traditional set of managing for cash in difficult times watch your costs very aggressively but at the time same stay the course with the brand discounting prices really doesn’t make a lot of sense at the end of the day it is imperative for luxury companies to deliver good value it doesn’t mean the price has to be lower just make sure that whatever is delivered is a good value — great quality great fashion great brand… the savviest people know that the number one strategy is to stay the course knowledgewharton i know that attorneys are often hired by the people they represent but to go from a job handling tax matters for a washington dc law firm to becoming ceo of gucci that’s quite a switch why did you make that move and why do you think it worked so well over that year time span de sole first of all the move was really by chance i was representing one side of the gucci family the company had a huge tax problem at some point back in the early s some family members asked me to become president of gucci america to help them resolve the tax issues which i did in the meantime the american company had a lot of problems so i fixed the problems and stayed there the company did quite well actually when the last family member took over the company unfortunately he was not the best manager in  the old group went bankrupt — stopped paying employees — so the shareholders at the time a private equity company purchased the shares of maurizio gucci the other members of the family asked me in  to move from the united states to italy where i became the ceo of gucci group that just happened to me there was no planning there in fact at one point in  i considered going  back to be a lawyer until i got a phone call and i was asked to move to italy to see if i could fix the company knowledgewharton you are credited with saving gucci from bankruptcy — making it profitable and prestigious once again — by using what one newspaper called “american style management practices” i’m wondering what those practices were and how you implemented them de sole i would say that has been defined very simply the company was broke in  i tried to liquidate business in a very rational analytical way most important i am a very driven person and i think i had very clear ideas at that time because i had already served for several years as president of gucci america so i had a pretty good understanding of the company’s problems i just parachuted into a situation which was catastrophic but by the same token i recognized that there were a lot of very competent people and i thought that i turned out to be a good leader i rallied them and made sure that everybody understood the direction we were going i always was able to deal with people well i came from a culture also in which i recognized talent so i’m not afraid of surrounding myself with competent people and most important i was very lucky because the other survivor who was there as the company was collapsing was tom ford they wanted to fire tom ford but i thought that was really stupid i thought tom ford was quite good knowledgewharton as a designer de sole as a designer i said ‘well i think this guy is great’ so i convinced tom to stay — to become creative director of the company it was a brilliant decision because tom turned out to be probably the great designer of the last  years and we work well together but not only with him we had a great team i was able to get everybody on the same page we had a very clear strategy everybody understood where we were going and we made decisions very quickly there was this great sense of urgency and so everything worked out well in fact when i arrived in florence from the united states after leaving gucci america to take over the company the cfo of investcorp which was the owner of gucci at the time welcomed me in florence we were in the cafeteria and he said “well i hope you can do something here because gucci is an albatross around our neck” less than two years later they sold the company and made  billion in profit knowledgewharton there are stories about highprofiled highpowered businessmen executives starting out together in a business relationship and then for some reason coming to blows i know that you and tom ford bring different strengths to the current partnership at tom ford international but that aside what makes the relationship between the two of you work so well de sole first of all there’s a great relationship of trust in the sense that i trust tom  and i think he trusts me  the second thing i think is that we have very deep respect tom is a creative genius also i really do believe that in life to be successful you have to have knowledge of two important things one what you know and two what you don’t know i’m totally aware that i’m not a creative person i understand a collection i can tell you if it’s going to sell or not going to sell i do very well with that but i’m not a creative person i wouldn’t know how to do it i have a great immense respect for tom and his expertise so there is a very clear definition of roles also i have to tell you that i really have an extraordinary admiration for tom you see as a businessman you can learn about merchandise you can learn about stores you can learn to understand what is a good product what is a bad product what is a good fashion show what is not a good fashion show however being creative is a totally different universe i think creative people can see things that normal human beings cannot so and always most importantly i treat tom with immense respect… businessmen are a dime a dozen creative people are truly extraordinary  knowledgewharton do you have a sense of how social networking sites viral marketing buzz marketing product placement all these new marketing techniques — how they are changing the way we perceive and buy fashion de sole there are a lot of ways these days to get your story around i would say that over the last year i’ve seen some of them become very very important it was started a long time ago with celebrities being dressed by designers that phenomenon has become very popular helped by all sorts of gossip magazines covering who’s wearing what when it has been spread even more by the internet so it has become much more prominent and important by the same token i really do believe that excellent pr and the ability to project the image of the brand consistently is still very very important that’s one of the real great strengths of tom not only do we have a great designer who can design beautiful clothes and wonderful accessories but we have someone with an amazing eye and amazing marketing ability he’s done some of the greatest campaigns i still buy oldfashioned magazines just to look at the ads it’s amazing to me how many people now are redoing what we were doing with tom in and tom was really avantguard knowledgewharton given all these marketing techniques though do you feel that it’s more difficult to control the brand image de sole yes and no at the end of the day it is very very important to be very disciplined with everything you do i think that can always be controlled i think it’s up to the management of any brand to make sure that the image of the brand is always controlled knowledgewharton in what ways do you think that the financial downturn has changed consumers you started out talking about this about how consumers are now pushing back on price they are much more sale and discount conscious will this be a longterm change or as you touched on earlier might they revert back to their old ways once the recession is over de sole again nobody knows the real answer but my instinct tells me that this difficult time is going to last it’s not going to be fixed in a few months i think that people obviously are very concerned but my experience is that at the end of the day the consumer forgets people love luxury brands historically if you think about it during the stone age people were buying bracelets and earrings made of stone so it’s something that’s part of human nature my sense is that things will get back to being good the real issue is that it’s going to last some time i think that it’s going to be a year or two or three but nobody knows knowledgewharton can you name two or three leadership qualities that you think an executive needs to manage successfully de sole yes first of all i really do believe that the most important thing is to be able to communicate effectively with your own people… i had this habit from day one that i would go into the cafeteria of the company in florence and i continued that throughout my career every two or three weeks i would talk to people — everybody including cleaning people — and just tell them how the company was doing what we were trying to do i think it’s very important that everybody in the company understand what the mission is what we are trying to do everybody is trying to be on the same page i think that’s the most important thing in leadership obviously the second thing would be to hire very competent people that was a little bit natural for me because you have to understand i came from legal background if you are in a law firm it’s not very hierarchical and if somebody was number one in his class at harvard law school for example  it doesn’t matter that he or she is young there’s respect for intellectual ability i always wanted to hire competent people and i want to hear what they have to say it’s very important for a leader to be openminded and invite debate and get people to talk about the issues very openly also the last family member who ran gucci was doing a lot of things that i thought didn’t make any sense so in part i learned a negative way just by looking at what was going on and wondering why these guys are doing this i remember this one example every time there was a problem this gentleman would try to find out who had caused it that was basically silly in a company it is an issue of processes if a mistake is made i don’t care who’s done it we have to understand why we made the mistake and just make sure that we look forward and don’t repeat it this sort of hunt for the culprit i thought was very silly so we had a great management team we became really stars in the industry because of a phenomenal management team we hired all the best people it was a very open management style my door was always open i would talk to anybody i tried to hire great people and let them do their job we worked very well knowledgewharton what are your expansion plans going forward for tom ford international de sole we are a very young company we opened — with really immense success — our first store in new york just a year and a half ago we are now present in some of the best locations — bergdorf goodman neiman marcus in the united states harrods in london we opened a beautiful store in milan last year so the plan for the next year and half is to open in the united states in beverly hills and in probably las vegas we’re looking at a project there obviously the most important step would be to expand in asia we’ll be opening this fall in yoshikin in tokyo and in the galleria in korea which is like the bergdorf goodman of korea and then looking at china and hong kong so that would be the next step… i was really not expecting the economy to collapse but that’s life you know you have to manage whatever comes your way knowledgewharton my last question is what advice would you give to any man or woman who has just been named head of a fashion house de sole i would because of the difficult times manage for cash but the most important thing is some would say just stay the course you understand what your brand is all about you can’t really start changing everything — that would be the worst thing to do stay the course one thing i also found that was very very important in our business — i spend an enormous amount of time visiting stores i used to talk to the store people all the time because if you really want to know what is going on in the retail business you should go and talk to the sales people they are there they see the customers every day they know what is working so my biggest advice is just devote the time to do this at the end of the day the store is the soul of the brand you know most people are not sophisticated about fashion a brand is your store for example if you mention chanel to people they think immediately about the chanel store so traveling to stores being in them understanding the store making sure the brand is properly presented — i think this is very important if you want to be an effective ceo of a brand devote time to understanding your market knowledgewharton thank you for joining us today supports kws

already started by such actions as cutting product lines improving quality no more plastic closing unprofitable outlets overhauling stockcontrol and orderingsystems and selling a palatial office in milan in order to move guccis headquarters back to florence second he had the more difficult task of making the gucci name desirable in the marketplace once more in this regard he decided that the
