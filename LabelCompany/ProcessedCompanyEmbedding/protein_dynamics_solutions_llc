product quote analysis collection reporting compliance specifications first the basics size and size distributions by cumulants and regularization for dls data cumulative size distribution as well as molar mass determination for sls data from the nanostar statistical analysis on your measurements with display of mean minimum maximum and standard deviation is provided but there is more to your results than calculation of size dynamics can perform virtually any transition analysis be it temperature or concentration dependence or any parameter measured or defined by the user linear exponential and sigmoid curve analyses are provided for maximum flexibility size and size distributions analyze protein and particle sizes using the method of cumulants or regularization report average radius diameter and diffusion coefficient as well as the width of the distribution in terms of polydispersity  polydispersity or polydispersity index pdi in regularization size distributions may be viewed as intensity or mass distributions and custom data labels may created for each peak    cumulative size distributions for a broad size distribution it is important to control the entire distribution rather than the mean radius alone dynamics provides calculation of the percentage of samples below a certain size of particles either diameter or radius with values for d d and d the size of the sample below   and  of the entire distribution lies respectively the width of the distribution defined as ddd is calculated as well transition analysis monitor protein melting or unfolding determine temperature transitions for your biomolecule every molecule behaves differently thats why dynamics provides analysis in terms of the onset transition temperature for aggregating samples midpoint for samples with a defined end state and linear analysis for any type of transition similarly determine the critical micelle concentration cmc with our concentration dependence analysis there are no limitations when it comes to analyzing trends for your samples any transition can be analyzed with the custom parametric analysis select parameters such as ph versus radius or salt concentration versus molar mass even perform statistical analysis for duplicate or triplicate samples or overlay the analysis curves for multiple samples for all of the analysis types listed above       absolute molar mass determination measure the absolute molar mass of proteins and small polymers in batch with the dedicated static light scattering detector of the dynapro nanostar – simultaneously – while collecting dls data compare the results for molar mass with the hydrodynamic radius to determine molecular conformation and distinguish between aggregation and protein unfolding for measurements of the absolute molar mass in chromatography mode or batch measurements of large polymers we recommend the use of our multiangle light scattering instruments    everything is already set up for the protein scientist simply open a new experiment and start recording your data immediately data are stored analyzed and presented in real time dynamics features an intuitive bit
