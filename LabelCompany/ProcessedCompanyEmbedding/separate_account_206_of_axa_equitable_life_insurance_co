monies received at axa equitable from july   to july   and end with the last cell established on july   for monies received at axa equitable from july   to july   ii investment cell identification  a

pexhnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd iv electronic funds transfer facility  each day there will be one wire transfer either from axa equitable to principal or from principal to axa equitable such transfer will combine transactions in the threeyear and fiveyear gras and will be a net amount including contributions and withdrawals if such net amount is positive axa equitable will transfer the amount to principal if such is negative principal will send the amount to axa equitable for disbursements principal agrees that it will wire funds on the same day provided axa equitable gives notice before  am all wires will be preceded by detailed faxed information from axa equitable to principal specifying contributions and withdrawals by cell v interest rate establishment  linda crawford or her designee at principal will establish the weekly interest rates in accordance with the pricing formula each tuesday principal will determine the threeyear and fiveyear treasury note constant maturity as reported in the wall street journal the yield will be calculated in accordance with contract specifications for the threeyear weekly gras the guaranteed pricing formula calls for principal to guarantee a positive spread of  ninety basis points over the three year treasury note rate for the fiveyear weekly gras a guaranteed positive spread of  one hundred and ten basis points over the five year treasury note rate will apply these guaranteed credited interest rates are net of principals administrative fees but do not reflect the deduction of axa equitables program expense and administration charges which will be calculated by axa equitable payable to axa equitable monthly as a withdrawal from each of the cells established under these contracts and deducted by axa equitable from the rate payable to participants the interest rate to be credited will be an effective annual yield based on a day year axa equitable understands that during a leap year such as  principal will use daily interest factors based on a day year and principal will credit interest for february  principals daily interest factors extend  nine places from the decimal point axa equitable the recordkeeper will absorb any residual interest differences resulting from cash flow timing leap year or from daily interest factors being slightly different at the fund level vi interest

principal credits interest on its gras from date of deposit up to but not including date of withdrawal axa equitable accounts for interest beginning the date after deposit up to and including the date of withdrawal for most deposit transactions this will not produce any interest differences between axa equitable and principal however a difference in the amount of interest credited will exist on contributions received on fridays and on any business day preceding a holiday on which axa equitable or principal is closed for example if axa equitable receives a deposit on friday interest will be credited to participants on saturday and sunday principal would receive this same contribution from axa equitable on monday and would begin crediting interest then this will produce an interest difference which to some extent will be offset by withdrawals being paid out fridays it is estimated the total difference will be not greater than  for both contracts at the end of the accumulation period in order to reconcile this difference axa equitable will make a onetime payment to these contracts or request a withdrawal representing the amount of difference axa equitable will determine these amounts in july  at the end of the last open period and forward them in one wire per contract to principal a letter indicating the amount to be allocated to each cell will also be sent principal agrees to process these adjustments to the appropriate cells principal will record this one time principal payment or withdrawal as a contribution or withdrawal viii premature withdrawal penalty

principal agrees that no penalties will be taken from contracts other than that currently open for contributions valerie wade will communicate the withdrawal and penalty amount to principal principal will withdraw from the contracts the withdrawal amount and the penalty amount and for fund balance reporting purposes reduce the cells by both amounts however only the withdrawal amount will actually be paid out to axa equitable principal will retain the penalty amount ix deduction of axa equitable fees  principal acknowledges that fee deductions will be withdrawn from each of the cells established under both contracts these fees include the program expense charge the investment accounting fee and certain other charges described in the prospectus these amounts will not be reported to principal as a separate transaction but will be combined with other benefit withdrawals as with such withdrawals principal will reduce the cells by the appropriate amounts and wire these amounts to axa equitable the same day they are reported if they are reported before  am x fund balance reporting  linda crawford or her designee at principal will prepare a monthly fund balance statement for each investment cell under each contract once contributions have been added to all investment cells principal will prepare  fund balance statements these reports will include  beginning balance

the end of each reporting month all questions concerning the fund balance statements should be directed to linda crawford at principal xi investment cell maturity  for the year contract principal will make payment of the entire balance in each investment cell on the wednesday which is  weeks after the close of the cells contribution term for the year contract principal will make payment of the

or a state bank holiday prevents axa equitable from forwarding amounts to principal and such delay results in a weekly cell having been closed principal agrees to treat those amounts as if they had been received for the cell which would have been opened except for the holiday closing this will avoid increasing the differences in principals and axa equitable fund balances as a result of timing differences following is a list of the bank and company holidays note if one of those holidays falls on a saturday or sunday principal will be open on either the preceding friday or following monday

variable investment option is measured in units each unit has a unit value while the unit value relates to the net asset value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio there is not a onetoone correlation in the dollar amount for example if at the time of the portfolios inception the net asset value of the portfolio was  per share the unit value of the corresponding investment option may actually have been  per unit if the portfolios net asset value grew to  per share the next day the unit value of the corresponding variable investment option would have increased proportionately but not by the exact same dollar amount the value of each unit will increase or decrease each day and reflect all reinvested dividends and distributions from the corresponding portfolio the daily unit value calculation will also take into account the deduction of any mortality and expense risk charges that apply under your contractpolicy the number of your units in any variable investment option does not change unless there is an event or transaction under your contractpolicy that involves moving assets into or out of that option whenever any amount is withdrawn or deducted from one of your contractpolicys variable investment options we redeem the number of units that has a value equal to that amount on the effective date of the redemption this happens for example when all or a portion of monthly deductions and transactionbased charges are allocated to that option or when loans transfers withdrawals and surrenders are made from that option your investment results in a variable

regulations significantly simplified the accountbased method of calculating the minimum required distribution amount among other things the regulations provide the use of a single life expectancy table based solely on the life of the participant for most situations when the participant reaches his or her required beginning date the only exception is when the sole primary beneficiary is a spouse who is more than ten years younger than the participant in this situation the joint life and last survivor expectancy table may be used the individuals who are required to take minimum distributions will most likely be able to take smaller amounts from their account each year allowing more of their assets the potential to grow the rmd amount and tax savings if any will depend on the age and value of the participants retirement account a participant does not have to choose whether to recalculate or not to recalculate the factor to use in dividing the account value will depend upon the individuals age as of the year of the distribution a person can change hisher beneficiary after age  without affecting hisher rmd did this answer your question yes  no can a rmd election be
