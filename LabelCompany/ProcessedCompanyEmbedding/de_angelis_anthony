some tanks had special compartments at the top and others were a maze of pipes where oil could be shuttled between them to make one tank of oil appear in other tanks at key times when inspectors visited and dipped the tanks they found oil and everything seemed fine the loans based on the warehouse receipts were guaranteeing that the oil was really in the tanks what was puzzling about the quality of amexs field warehousing operation was that since de angelis was theoretically buying so much they essentially authenticated the existence of much more salad oil than was actually accounted for in the entire united states according to monthly reports from the department of agriculture while the warehouse operation was small for amex they were lenient with de angelis as he was one of their biggest customers with amex continuing to vouch for the inventories their trusted seal of approval combined with de angelis talent for offering great deals mainstream companies such as bunge
