president and ceo developer of world’s first micro lab hires new leadership in preparation for clinical studies and commercialization july    pm eastern daylight time st paul minnbusiness wireativa medical corp developer of the world’s first multidetection micro lab to help clinicians make immediate treatment decisions today announced james m mcnally phd as president and ceo mcnally brings to ativa plus years of executive leadership experience in the medical device and diagnostic industry including most recently serving as vice president of quest diagnostics’ products division including its pointofcare companies he has been awarded  patents for his health care and diagnostic innovations “in my career i’ve had the opportunity to review hundreds of diagnostic instruments and businesses we believe ativa’s system will be able to deliver central lab quality results in about  minutes during a single office visit clinicians will be able to better diagnose and treat patients while significantly reducing traditional lab test costs” mcnally said “i look forward to taking this important technology through commercialization” when launched ativa’s system should allow health care professionals to obtain results in minutes rather than hours or days to improve the patient experience practitioners will get critical test information for detecting and managing disease during the clinical visit where it is most valuable the ativa system also reduces the chances for lab test errors and misdiagnoses as it does not require sample handling by multiple health care staff “central laboratory testing is subject to many factors that potentially could adversely affect the integrity of the sample and prevent the timely reporting of an accurate test result to your provider” according to a  report by lab tests online “ativa’s micro lab with the footprint of a toaster will ultimately be able to accurately and efficiently test up to  percent of medicare’s top  blood tests” mcnally said “ativa’s patented disposable microfluidic cards need only a drop of blood yet compete with the quality and consistency of large lab instruments based on our preclinical complete blood count results the ativa system holds great potential where speedtodiagnosis is critical such as emergency rooms and urgent care facilities as well as in private physician offices and retail clinics and pharmacies because of the system’s affordability and portability we believe there will be great interest in this system in emerging countries many of which lack access to quality lab testing of any kind” “jim mcnally’s experience with an array of pointofcare products including navigating commercialization issues and the fda gives him important insights to lead ativa at this stage” said james b stake chairman of ativa’s board of directors “this system presents a breakthrough product in clinical diagnostics” note to editors a headshot of james m mcnally is available at wwwativamedcomphotos
