foods enjoy walmarts inventory of organic delights which are made without artificial ingredients theyre grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers a food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products like different meats fruits vegetables grains and dairy products organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution the farmers who grow organic produce dont use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds for example organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds so what makes a product organic for certain the us department of agriculture usda established a certification program that requires all organiclabeled foods to meet strict government standards first these standards regulate how such foods are grown handled and processed thus any product labeled as organic must be usda certified you could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together in one convenient location whatever your dietary goals or requirements are you can easily find foods that meet your needs at walmart just filter your search by dietary need and youll
