ritchie patented his first water device in  by connecting underground running water to automatic floatcontrolled watering equipment heated with a kerosene lamp the water remained free flowing in cold weather farmers liked the laborsaving qualities of thomas ritchie’s patented waterer and a new business was born in  ritchie incorporated and moved to an old machine shed in marshalltown part of the manufacturing also took place in a small ′ x ′ machine shed in conrad until  that year blacksmith cd wilson purchased ritchie moved the business to conrad and operated the business out of a small blacksmith shop shortly after the move automatic electric heat was introduced to the watering equipment helping to establish ritchie as the leader in the industry after his father’s death in  c d wilson jr took the reins of the business and expanded its market and the technology of the product to meet demands the company had gone from making six models to more than  giving it the distinction

existed without dennis ritchie father of the c programming language and cocreator of the unix operating system by jason perlow for tech broiler  october  5   gmt  pdt  topic cloud  four years ago we lost two people who had immense influence on our industry it is undeniable that steve jobs brought us innovation and iconic products like the world had never seen as well as a cult following of consumers and end users that mythologized him the likes of which will probably be never seen again without his contributions its likely none of us would be using personal computers today sophisticated software applications or even a modern internet at the time of his passing like many in this industry despite my documented differences with the man and his company i paid my respects and acknowledged his influence but the magical products that apple and steve jobs  as well as many other companies created owe just about everything we know and write about in modern computing as it exists today to dennis ritchie who passed away on october   at the age of  dennis ritchie the younger generation that reads this column is probably scratching their heads who was dennis ritchie dennis ritchie wasnt some billionaire meticulous wunderkind from silicon valley that mystified audiences with standing room only presentations in his minimalist black mock turtleneck with new shiny products and wild rhetoric aimed against his competitors no dennis ritchie was a bearded somewhat disheveled computer scientist who wore cardigan sweaters and had a messy office unlike jobs who was a college dropout he was phd a harvard university grad with degrees in physics and applied mathematics and instead of the gleaming silicon valley he worked at att bell laboratories in new jersey yes jersey as in what exit steve jobs has frequently been compared to thomas edison for the quirkiness of his personality and inventive nature i have my issues with that comparison in that we are actually giving jobs credit for being an actual technologist and someone who actually invented something it is important to realize that while indeed the man was brilliant in his own way and his contributions were extremely important to the technology and computer industries steve jobs was not a technologist indeed he had a very strong sense of style and industrial design understood what customers wanted and was a master marketer and salesperson all of these make him a giant in our industry but inventor no dennis m ritchie on the other hand invented and coinvented two key software technologies which make up the dna of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age special feature innovation how to be a worldchanger the best business leaders use tech as one of their most important levers to drive innovation and change heres the wisdom to make it happen read more it sounds like a wild claim but it really is true first lets start with the c programming language developed by ritchie between  and  c is considered to be the first truly modern and portable programming language in the 5 years or so since its introduction it has been ported to practically every systems architecture and operating system in existence because it is an imperative compiled procedural programming language allowing for lexical variable scope and recursion and allowing lowlevel access to memory as well as complex functionality for io and string manipulation the language became quite versatile this allowed ritchie and brian kernighan to refine it to a degree which eventually was further refined by the xj committee of the american national standards institute as the ansi c programming language in  in  kernighan and ritchie published the book the c programming language referred to by many simply as kr it is considered to be a computer science masterpiece and a critical reference for explaining the concepts of modern programming and is still used as a text when teaching programming to students in computer science curricula even today ansi c as a programming language is also still used heavily today and it has since mutated into a number of sister languages all of which have strong followings the most popular c pronounced c plus plus which was introduced by bjarne stroustrup in 5 and added support for objectoriented programming and classes is used on a variety of operating systems including every major unix derivative including linux and the mac and is the primary programming language that has been used for microsoft windows software development for at least  years objectivec created by brad cox and todd love in the s at a company called stepstone added smalltalk messaging capabilities to the language further extending the languages objectoriented and code reusability features it was largely considered an obscure derivative of c until it was popularized in the nextstep and openstep operating systems in the late s and early s on steve jobs next computer systems the company he formed after he was ousted by apples board in 5 what happened next of course is computing history next was purchased by apple in  and jobs returned to become ceo of the company in  in  apple launched mac os x which makes heavy use of objectivec and objectoriented technologies introduced in nextstepopenstep while c is also used heavily on the mac objectivec is what is used to program to the native objectoriented cocoa api in the xcode ide which is central to the gesture recognition and animation features on ios that powers the iphone and the ipad objectivec also provides frameworks for the foundation kit and application kit that are essential to building native os x and ios applications microsoft has its own derivative of c in c pronounced c sharp that was introduced in  and serves as the foundation for programming within the net framework c is also is the basis for programming the new modern applications in the windows runtime winrt that has evolved into the universal windows platform uwp in windows  it is also used within linux and other unix derivatives as the programmatic environment for mono which is a portable version of the net framework but cs influence doesnt end at c language derivatives java which is an important enterprise programming language and has itself morphed into dalvik and the android runtime which is used as the primary programming environment for android is heavily based on c syntax other languages such as ruby perl and php which form the basis for the modern dynamic web all use syntax introduced in c created by dennis ritchie so it could be said that without the work of dennis ritchie we would have no modern software at all whats hot on zdnet petya ransomware free decryption tool released for the original versions of this nasty malware when will microsoft end support for your version of windows or office security flaw shows g g lte networks are just as prone to stingray phone tracking best practices for managing the security of corporateowned smartphones and tablets i could end this article simply with what ritchies development of c means to modern computing and how it impacts everyone but i would only really be describing half of a lifes work of this man ritchie is also the cocreator of the unix operating system which of course after being prototyped in assembly language was completely rewritten in the early s in c since the very first implementation of unics booted on a dec pdp back in  it has mutated into many other similar operating systems running on a huge variety of systems architectures name a major computer vendor and every single one of them has had at some time an implementation of unix even microsoft which once owned a product called xenix and since sold it to sco now defunct youll want to click and zoom into this picture so you can get a better understanding of this family essentially there are three main branches one branch is the system v unixes that we know today is extant as ibm aix oracle solaris and hewlett packards hpux all of these are considered to be big iron oses that drive critical transactionoriented business applications and databases in the largest enterprises in the world the fortune  without the system v unixes the fortune  probably wouldnt get much of anything done business would essentially grind to a halt they may only represent about  to  percent of any particular enterprises computing population but its a very important  percent the second branch the bsds berkeley systems distribution include freebsdnetbsdopenbsd which form the basis for both mac os x and the ios that powers the iphone and ipad they also are used as the backbone that supports much of the critical infrastructure that actually runs the internet the third branch of unix is not even a branch at all  gnulinux the linux kernel developed by linus torvalds combined with the gnu userspace programs tools and utilities provides for a complete reimplementation of a unixlike or unixcompatible operating system from the ground up linux of course has become the most disruptive of all the unix operating systems it scales from the very small from embedded microcontrollers to smartphones to tablets and desktops and even the most powerful supercomputers one such linux supercomputer ibms watson even beat ken jennings on jeopardy while the world watched in awe still it is important to recognize that linux and gnu contains no unix code at all  hence the free software recursive phrase gnus not unix but by design gnulinux behaves much like unix and it could be said that without unix being developed by ritchie and his colleagues brian kernighan ken thompson douglas mcllroy and joe ossanna at bell labs in the first place there never would have been any linux or an open source software movement or a free software foundation or a richard stallman to be glad steve jobs is gone for that matter but enough of religion and ideology we owe much to dennis ritchie more than we can ever possibly imagine without his contributions its likely none of us would be using personal computers today sophisticated software applications or even a modern internet no android smartphones no fancy dvrs and streaming devices and no macs and ipads for steve jobs and apple to make amazingly great no microsoft windows  or surface books no cloud no aws no azure no apps for that no internet of anything to dennis ritchie i thank you  for giving all of us the technology to be the technologists we are today dennis
