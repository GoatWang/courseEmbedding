rating    contact informationpier  imports inc united states to start off i would like to say that i will most likely never shop at pier one again our experience started off good sales lady was very informative and pleasant we found a love seat we wanted to buy but they did not have it in stock we asked if we could buy the floor model but denied that was fine we were also interested in a table but were not sure if it would work until we checked at home we were told they would order one in for us for the next week we do not live in kelowna but in vernon the next week we picked up our loveseat and wanted to buy the table but they did not have one once again we asked if we could purchase their floor model and were told no a few days later we ordered by phone the table so the next week we picked up our table and brought it homewe opened the box and there were two legs missing we phoned the kelowna store and were told they would have to be ordered in and it would take two weeks they also gave us the option to take the two legs from their model or we could even have their floor model so why would they not let us buy it in the first place we opted to wait for the legs to come in the manager called back and told us the girl we talked to was mistaken and that the legs would only take a week to come in so we called the next week and no legs talked to another manager and she said she would look into it and she called back to say that they were fedexed and would be in monday or tuesday we said we would pick up on friday called friday and guess what they do not know if they are in looks like another week in waiting     submit         close comments  united states products  services was the above complaint useful        more pier  imports inc complaints  reviews pier
