griseofulvinedit in the s glaxo group ltd glaxo and imperial chemical industries ici each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin nn – they created a patent pool by crosslicensing their patents subject to express licensing restrictions that the chemical from which the finished form of the drug tablets and capsules was made must not be resold in bulk form and they licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions– the effect and intent of the bulksale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as pricecutters and the effect was to maintain stable uniform prices the united states brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—united states v glaxo group ltd—charging them with violation of the sherman act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents the government appealed

international reported that a number of patients had experienced difficulty in withdrawing from ssris in general it was agreed that withdrawal was indeed a problem in some patients but there was a difference of opinion on the degree of dependence that was involved given the possibility that the need for treatment of resistant or relapsing disease could make these drugs indispensable for patient care the committee expressed concern about the possibility of inappropriate prescribing resulting in the risk of problems of withdrawal outweighing the benefits of treatment with ssris referencesedit

failure in april that year gsk began a sixyear openlabel randomized trial known as record to examine rosiglitazone and cardiovascular events two gsk metaanalyses in  and  showed an increased risk of

fivestar hotels and spas from  paxils label along with those of similar drugs included an fdamandated boxed warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under  an internal smithkline beecham document said in  about withheld data from two gsk studies it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that pediatric efficacy had not been demonstrated as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine the company ghostwrote an article published in  in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials study  the article concluded that paxil was generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents the suppression of the

chemical from which the finished form of the drug tablets and capsules was made must not be resold in bulk form and they licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions– the effect and intent of the bulksale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as pricecutters and the effect was to maintain stable uniform prices the united states brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—united states v glaxo group ltd—charging them with violation of the sherman act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents the government appealed to the supreme court which reversed in united states v glaxo group ltd  us

patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents the government appealed to the supreme court which reversed in united states v glaxo group ltd  us

striking number of reports on paroxetine and withdrawal syndrome  the representative of consumers international reported that a number of patients had experienced difficulty in withdrawing from ssris in general it was agreed that withdrawal was indeed a problem in some patients but there was a difference of opinion on the degree of dependence that was involved given the possibility that the need for treatment of resistant or relapsing disease could make these drugs indispensable for patient care the committee expressed concern about the possibility of inappropriate prescribing resulting in the risk of problems of withdrawal outweighing the benefits of treatment with ssris referencesedit  a b c annual report  pdf retrieved  april    glaxosmithkline statista retrieved  april    the worlds

licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions– the effect and intent of the bulksale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as pricecutters and the effect was to maintain stable uniform prices the united states brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—united states v glaxo group ltd—charging them with violation of the sherman act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents the government appealed

corporation  world health organization expert committee on drug dependence  the committee noted the striking number of reports on paroxetine and withdrawal syndrome  the representative of consumers international reported that a number of patients had experienced difficulty in withdrawing from ssris in general it was agreed that withdrawal was indeed a problem in some patients but there was a difference of opinion on the degree of dependence that was involved given the possibility that the need for treatment of resistant or relapsing disease could make these drugs indispensable for patient care the committee expressed concern about the possibility of inappropriate prescribing resulting in the risk of problems of withdrawal outweighing the benefits of treatment with ssris referencesedit

warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under  an internal smithkline beecham document said in  about withheld data from two gsk studies it would be

licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions– the effect and intent of the bulksale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as pricecutters and the effect was to maintain stable uniform prices the united states brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—united states v glaxo group ltd—charging them with violation of the sherman act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but

warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under  an internal smithkline beecham document said in  about withheld data from two gsk studies it would be

licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions– the effect and intent of the bulksale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as pricecutters and the effect was to maintain stable uniform prices the united states brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—united states v glaxo group ltd—charging them with violation of the sherman act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid the trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies but
