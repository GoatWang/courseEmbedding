maybe we want to work with students whose needs we can meet if you have additional questions please click here to set up a phone call with a member of our team   what we do inventright is a yearlong oneonone coaching program for more specific details visit our “coaching” page we are personal intimate and familiar you will form a close bond with your coach he or she will give you specific action steps for every part of the process of bringing an idea to life you will no longer wonder what you need to do next or secondguess your next step when you become our student your problems become our problems we’re on your team after your year with us our goal other than helping you license your ideas is that you don’t need us anymore we want you to turn to us and say “thanks for helping me through those projects i get it now i now know how to license my ideas” our program is as thorough as thorough gets our commitment to you is simple to teach you everything we know about this process and we know a lot you will be empowered with the confidence and knowledge to execute your vision what we aren’t make no mistake we are not licensing agents you keep  of any and every deal you make we also don’t do your work for you in the same vein we are not an invention submission company we do not evaluate ideas in the way you may be familiar with the only opinion that matters is the company you pitch your idea to for licensing consideration we provide feedback we offer insight and analysis we give you the upsides and downsides of every project you work on but we will not give you a ‘thumbsup’ or ‘thumbsdown’ we will discuss the benefits and limitations of each of your ideas with you ultimately teaching you how to do the evaluating yourself the best person to bring your idea to market is in fact you we think you must become the expert youre in control of your destiny — you and only you can do this who inventright students are lawyers plumbers stayathome parents doctors students retirees professionally trained product developers patent holders and complete novices succeed in our program we’ve had students as young as seventeen and as old as  the us army even hired us to teach them about licensing we field interest from national governments every now and then really anyone who has an idea and wants to learn how to bring it to market is a good fit for our program we’re looking for selfmotivated learners people who want to invest in themselves maybe you’re considering a change in your career maybe you’re just exploring an interest in product development if you want to see your ideas on store shelves but don’t want to start a business to get them there licensing is for you   answering common questions i’d like to be your partner we do not partner with inventors when you are done with our coaching program you will know you can do this yourself without any help you won’t have to share your profits we are your mentorcoachteacher we are not your agents or your business partners what we do is give you complete and total support from the very inception of an idea to closing a deal after working on several products during your year with us we want you to say “i get it guys i don’t need you anymore” we won’t be insulted that’s the greatest compliment you could pay us i don’t have any money but i have a great idea can you help me sell it like we said we don’t do partnerships and we don’t take commission you can license simple ideas without spending a lot of money for example the cost of filing a provisional patent application with the patent and trademark office is  we will teach you how to write your own ppa — one that stops workarounds and therefore has value we will show you how to create a fantasticlooking sell sheet for close to nothing by hiring freelance graphic designers many of our students need to invest just  before they are able to start calling companies this is not true of all ideas but it is true of many there aren’t many businesses that require such a minimal investment per product our step system is easy to follow we focus on getting you to work smarter not harder ultimately developing a game plan that requires less money than you think you need i want to license my ideas but i’m not sure i have the time we help you stay on track we’ve had students spend as little as two to four hours a week bringing their ideas to market and still be successful when your coach is keeping you laserfocused on what your next step is during your sessions this becomes very doable in fact we strongly advise our students to keep their day jobs and maintain their lifestyle you can make a lot of money licensing but it is not a get rich quick scheme it won’t happen overnight get some royalties coming in and then quit your day job if you like i’m tired of trying to venture my idea why should i try to license it if you have tried selling your product yourself you’re in good shape to try licensing you’ll be able to use the work you’ve already done — like making a good working prototype or creating a sell sheet or gathering sales or test data — to sell potential licensees on your idea we show you how to leverage what you’ve already done you probably know by now how hard it is to get new products into stores if you’ve been trying to venture and sell your idea yourself distribution is one of the biggest benefits of licensing when you license an idea your licensee is already selling products in the stores you want to be in please can you just answer this one question answering your one question isn’t really going to help you the reason it’s never just one question chances are you aren’t even aware of the right questions to be asking if we answer one question you’ll inevitably come back with another our oneonone coaching program opens our students’ eyes to the bigger picture — the benefit to you is learning how to sell your ideas while working on a reallife project  you’ll have less questions after you sign up because you’ll have your coach guiding you every step of the way you can ask your coach anything of course but you will want to let them guide you — and then come back with questions what if i’m not based in the united states we’ve had students from more than  countries you can license your idea to an american company as well as companies around the world from anywhere in the world you do not need to be based in the us to become an inventright student we love working with international students and are proud to help people around the world if you have additional questions please

new products by stephen key stephen key is an awardwinning inventor and entrepreneur who has licensed more than  products he is the cofounder of inventright a company that teaches people how to license their ideas and the author of one simple idea turn your dreams into a licensing goldmine while letting others do the work he lives in glenbrook nevada stephenkeymedia cofounder inventrightstephenkeymedia write a comment credit getty images some industries have embraced open innovation more than others im talking about industries that have an enormous appetite for new product ideas companies competing within these industries are very actively looking for your innovations because to be frank their success depends on them as a result they know how to work with outside product developers they have specific policies and procedures in place theyre more likely to treat you fairly if you want to pitch them one of your ideas you wont even have to make a cold call to get inyou can simply use their online submission forms my students have had a lot of success licensing their ideas to these industries you can too  kitchen the kitchen industry is on fire i mean how many cooking shows are there on television these days chefs are veritable rock stars at the same time americans are thinking more deeply about what they put into their bodies everyone from mark bittman to michael pollan is talking about how cooking at home is one of the best ways to feed yourself and your family all of which is to say this is a great industry to design an idea for gadgets that make cooking easier and cleaner are especially desirable at make in kansas city last weekend the challenge presented to teams of competing inventors was come up with a solution to an everyday problem we face in the kitchen can you at the end of the day everyone has to eat if you have an idea for a kitchen product consider contacting warren tuttle hes a product scout for lifetime brands  pet according to the american pet products association approximately  of all households in the united states have a dog and  own a cat needless to say we love our pets they give us so much joy that we want to pamper and entertain them people who are barely able to make their mortgage payments continue caring for their pets for that reason the pet industry continues to grow entrepreneurs ive met on the road tell me that the companies they approach with their pet product ideas welcome them with open arms  directresponse television ever heard of the snuggie i bet it feels as if everywhere i turn i run into an as seen on tv display in a retail store these days drtv has always been a popular avenue for inventors but these days the industry is absolutely booming for one drtv companies move fast someone will get back to you about your idea quickly for that reason i recommend submitting your idea to one company at a time another thing i love about this industry is that it doesnt require patents if you happen to live in san diego the final days of response expo are going down now if you have an idea you think is right for drtv consider pitching it to carrie jeske at will it launch  diy hardware this has always been a great industry for inventors does your innovation get the job done more quickly or cheaply you might have a winner on your hands if you have an idea for the hardware industry you should consider attending the national hardware show in las vegas which is coming up in early may these arent the only hot industries out there but theyre definitely among the easiest to license an
