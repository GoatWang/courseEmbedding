partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form  an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about  to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc read nolos article how to form an llc to form your llc right now use nolos online llc which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state ending an llc under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need help start here

has money to put into the bank agrees to commit a certain amount of money for a set period of time in return for a fixed rate of interest while it is possible to withdraw the money earlier breaking the cd doing so comes with high interest penalties and is generally not advised cd terms the time period in which money is held in a certificate of deposit is called the term terms can run for any period of time but in general banks use the following terms  months  months  months  months  months  months  months and  months terms can either be described in months or years the term that is right for each individual depends on their goals the rate they which to earn and their future plans for the money in general if rates are going up savers should avoid putting the money into a longterm cd if rates are going down then the opposite is true and savers should try and lock into a good rate for an extended period of time in stable rate environments cds that are over  months in length can enable depositors to pick up a slight premium over savings accounts cd risk almost all banks provide cds to their consumers and they have been a mainstay of savers and retirement accounts for years if fdic insured the cd represents a safe place to put money that will generate a predictable return inflation is the main risk of a cd inflation can often run higher than the inflation adjusted return on a cd thus eroding the value of the money stored in the cd over time this is especially true for longerterm cds opened in low interest rate environments how interest is paid the method of distributing the interest earned on a cd varies by bank some banks pay interest monthly other semiannually and others at the maturity of the cd one advantage of a branchbased bank is that a depositor can walk into the bank and receive their interest that day in the form of a check online banks tend to use electronic funds transfer or check via mail interest rate since the financial crisis in  cds have become less popular because the yields they offer have dropped precipitously making it difficult for retirees and savers to generate sufficient income but investors looking for a place to stash some cash might still find cds an attractive place for some of their savings online banks generally offer better rates on six month cds but the accounts must be opened online view online bank rates when interest rates are falling it is often preferable to lock in high rates for an extended period of time with a longerterm cd when interest rates are rising depositors should avoid committing their money for long periods of time to see interest rate trends visit the bestcashcow rate analysis page advantages and disadvantages the advantages of a certificate of deposit from a branch bank are funds deposited in fdic banks and within insurance limits are protected by the full faith and credit of the united states government cds provide a predictable set rate of return depositors can walk into a local branch and open the cd and fund it that day question and inquiries can also be handles inperson the disadvantages of branchbased cds are the deposited money is committed for a certain period of time and can only be withdrawn with substantial penalties one year cds from branch banks often pay less interest than from online banks please see those rates here all banks listed on bestcashcow are fdic

product information oneyear cd  online banks  certificate of deposits are offering by most bank in a variety of maturity dates the year rates in the table above are listed in descending order based on annual percentage yield “apy” which is the rate of return that you will earn when adjusted for compounding over a  month period and the way in which banks are required by us banking regulations to advertise their cd rates a certificate of deposit represents a time commitment between a depositor someone who has money to put in the bank and a bank the depositor agrees to leave a specified amount of money in the bank for a set period of time the bank agrees to keep the money safe and to provide a fixed rate of return a year cd has a very brief time commitment and can also generate a rate of return above the prevailing savings rate therefore many people use year cds to slightly augment their rates of return over savings with only slightly more risk than they would have if they were entirely in savings accounts and money market accounts fdic insurance provided the bank is fdicinsured and the deposit amount is within fdic limits the principal is also secured by an agency of the united stated federal government against loss further information about fdic insurance is found in this article and if you have specific questions about your own circumstances you should use the fdic’s electronic deposit insurance estimator cd risk the principal of a cd is safe and insured as long as the deposit amount is fdic limits interest that accrues and is paid or deposited to the principal also is safe as long as the total balance remains within fdic limits a cd however bears two significant risks liquidity risk if you think you may need access to your principal during the period of the time commitment for a major purchase or an unforeseen expense cds are generally not a good place to store money the terms of most cds outline the penalty that will be assessed in order to access your capital this penalty is usually assessed in terms of time periods for example a common penalty on a year cd is  months although you should always check this carefully in the terms and conditions before opening a cd as it could be longer banks and credit unions are not obliged to offer an early withdrawal penalty and may change or remove or even refuse to honor the early withdrawal penalty in their paperwork for further details please read this article bestcashcow never recommends a strategy involving the purchase of a cd when you have a high likelihood that you will need your capital inflation risk since cds are considered a very safe investment when you stay within fdic and ncualimits  they often do not pay much over the anticipated rate of inflation and can often pay under this rate were interest rates to rise or the inflation rates to rise the real or inflation adjusted value of your cd can drop over time especially when you factor in the tax consequences of ownership of a cd in the event of rates rising you may be able to use the early withdrawal penalty to get your principal but for the reasons mentioned above bestcashcow does not recommend relying on such a strategy be sure to think about how cds fit into your overall portfolio objectives cd laddering an effective strategy used by many to bolster their savings strategy is to own cds with various maturities in other words a depositor with  and put  in a  month cd  in a  month cd  in a  month cd and  in a oneyear cd then your liquidity risk in highly diminished because you are always near maturity on one of your cds note that no more than  of these cds should be at the same bank in order to avoid exceeding fdic limits the reality is that we are in a very low interest rate environment and any cd with a maturity of less than  year is going to pay below perhaps well below the prevailing rates in the leading online savings accounts or at brickandmortar banks therefore the strategy outlined above would be largely absurd in the current environment a laddering strategy that would make more sense for the same depositor who might otherwise hold  in cash would be to put  in a one year cd every three months liquidity risk in the same way is diminished as the depositor is never more than  months from maturity yet the depositor is picking up some small improvement over the best savings rates than where all of his money to be in cash laddering strategies can also involve longer term cds but one that involves terms as little as  year can improve on the savings rates with minimal impairment to your liquidity more information on cd laddering is available in this article how interest is paid the method of distributing the interest earned on a cd varies by bank some banks pay interest monthly other semiannually and others at the maturity of the cd in general online banks pay the interest electronically either by adding it to the principal balance or with an ach transfer back to the depositors primary linked checking account other online banks may pay via a check in the mail interest rate currently the most competitive banks offer year rates that are slightly above the top online savings and money market rates depositors need to decide if they want the fixed rate of the cd or the flexibility of the savings account savings accounts do not come with any term time requirements in a rising rate environment it is generally better to keep money flexible and liquid and put it into either short term cds or savings or money market accounts  in a falling rate environment it is generally better to lock the rate using a cd or some other fixed rate investment in a stable rate environment you may be able to collect a small premium in exchange for your loss of liquidity online banks generally offer cds available to residents of any of the  states the cd must be opened online and funded either by online transfer or by mail frequently asked questions on certificates of deposit what are cd rates cd rates are the fix rate that the bank pays a depositor for entering a cd for the entire term of a cd they are expressed in annual percentage yield “apy” terms so that they are standardized  invested in a one year cd at  will be worth  at maturity in exactly  year  invested in a twoyear cd at  will be worth  in exactly  year and worth  at maturity assuming the interest is not paid out before maturity but is added to the principal please see bestcashcow’s savings  cd calculator to better understand the magic of compounded interest over time do cds pay interest monthly or yearly when opening a cd it is important to consider how interest is credited or paid interest can be credited to the cd monthly quarterly or annually for those cds of one year or less interest may be credited only at maturity when interest is paid the cd holder may have arranged for the interest to be mailed to them as a check the other option is for the interest to be added to the principal of the cd regardless of how and when interest is paid it is required to be expressed standardized by all banks in the form of an annual percentage yield “apy” rate how is interest on cds taxed interest on cds is taxed as ordinary income your bank will provide you with a int detailing the interest that you must report on your tax return at the end of each year regardless of whether interest is paid in the form of a check or added to principal cd holders need to report the interest in the year in which it is paid purchasing a certificate of deposit of oneyear or less that pays a single lump sum interest payment at maturity may defer tax on interest until the following year but otherwise holders of cds should generally expect to pay ordinary taxes on interest earned in every year in which they hold a cd further detail is found in irs publication  page  why are cd rates so low cd rates on terms of  and  years were very constantly low for many years from  to  as the fed funds rate was held at zero following the great recession rates on longer term cds were occasionally more interesting during this period depending more heavily on the level and direction of the us treasury bond the us federal reserve’s action towards normalizing interest rates has been painfully slow resulting from brexit european financial instability etc and cd rates have remained at levels that are very low by historical norms however we have seen cd rates rise in  and  as the federal reserve has begun to slowly raise the fed funds rate are cd rates going up or down when are they expected to rise if the federal reserve accelerates its plan to raise the fed funds rate or if global economic developments were to cause us treasury rates to rise we would quickly see higher cd rates however the global economic environment is uncertain with european longterm interest rates being negative should the us also enter a recession and the us year treasury rate fall still further it is possible that cd rates could fall further what is a good rate for a cd bestcashcow lists the best cd rates available from online banks above and the best rates from local banks and credit unions a good rate is the best rate that you can find at an fdic or ncuainsured institution provided that it compensates you adequately over the best savings rates for the liquidity that you
