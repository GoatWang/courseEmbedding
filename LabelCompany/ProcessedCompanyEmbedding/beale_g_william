interpretive lexicon of new testament greek loading sample × paperback  single  off   msrp book condition book condition choose new quantity log in for wishlist product description this interpretive lexicon has two primary functions aimed at facilitating the exegetical and translational task namely as a lexicon and also as an interpretive handbook first this book lists the vast majority of greek prepositions adverbs particles relative pronouns conjunctions and other connecting words that are notorious for being some of the most difficult words to translate for each word included page references are given for several major lexical resources where the user can quickly go to examine the nuances and parameters of the word for translation options this book will save considerable time for students of the greek new testament text for example for the greek preposition en occurs  times in the new testament covers four pages of small print in the bauerdanker lexicon bdag but interpretive lexicon digests those pages in just a few lines with the page numbers and section references given for a greekenglish lexicon of the new testament and other early christian literature rd edition bdag  and nd edition bagd  greek grammar beyond the basics daniel b wallace and prepositions and theology in the greek new testament murray j harris thus the translation options can be analyzed quickly for words with a lower frequency of occurrence and fewer translation options this book may be sufficient in itself as a lexicon secondly these prepositions conjunctions adverbs and connecting words in greek as in every language function as explicit discourselevel markers that are essential for ascertaining the main points of a passage therefore this interpretive lexicon also evaluates the discourse functions of each word that is defined and catalogued and categorizes its semantic range into defined logical relationships this feature of the lexiconadds an interpretiveelement since translation must include interpretation at least on a linguistic level for example en may be translated in many ways but those ways are categorized broadly in this book into relationships such as locative in among on meansend with by grounds because on account of temporal while at and so on this interpretive feature of the book is tremendously helpful for the exegetical process allowing for the translator to closely follow the logical flow of the text with greater efficiency this interpretive lexicon is thus a remarkable resource for student pastor and scholar alike
