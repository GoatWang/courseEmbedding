buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the funds most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio investments risks and performance principal investment strategies the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed income instruments that are rated below investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or if unrated are considered by the investment subadviser to be of comparable quality under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its investable assets in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed income instruments that are below investment grade commonly referred to as junk bonds with varying maturities and other investments including derivatives with similar economic characteristics the term “below investment grade” refers to instruments either rated ba or lower by moody’s investors service moody’s bb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings group sp or fitch inc fitch or comparably rated by another nrsro or if unrated are considered by the investment subadviser to be of comparable quality the term “investable assets” refers to the fund’s net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes the fund’s investable assets will be less than its total assets to the extent that it has borrowed money for noninvestment purposes such as to meet anticipated redemptions although the fund may invest in instruments of any duration or maturity the fund normally will seek to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration of three years or less and a weighted average maturity of five years or less the fund will provide  days’ prior written notice to shareholders of a change in the  policy stated above as of august   the fund’s weighted average portfolio duration was  years and the fund’s weighted average maturity was  years the types of fixedincome securities in which the fund may invest include bonds debentures notes commercial paper floating rate or variable rate instruments and other similar types of debt instruments as well as loan participations and assignments money market instruments paymentinkind securities and derivatives related to or referencing these types of securities and instruments the fund may invest in fixed income instruments of companies or governments the fund may invest without limit in us currencydenominated and foreign currency denominated fixed income securities issued by foreign issuers including issuers in emerging markets in determining which securities to buy and sell the investment subadviser will consider among other things the financial history and condition earnings trends analysts recommendations and the prospects and the management of an issuer the investment subadviser generally will employ fundamental analysis in making such determinations fundamental analysis involves review of financial statements and other data to attempt to predict an issuers prospects and to try to decide whether the price of the issuers security is undervalued or overvalued principal risks all investments have risks to some degree an investment in the fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objective is not a deposit with a bank is not insured endorsed or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency and is subject to investment risks including possible loss of your original investment bond obligations risk as with credit risk market risk and interest rate risk the funds holdings share price yield and total return may fluctuate in response to bond market movements the value of bonds may decline for issuerrelated reasons including management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods and services certain types of fixed income obligations also may be subject to “ call and redemption risk ” which is the risk that the issuer may call a bond held by the fund for redemption before it matures and the fund may lose income junk bonds risk highyield highrisk bonds have predominantly speculative characteristics including particularly high credit risk junk bonds tend to be less liquid than higherrated securities the liquidity of particular issuers or industries within a particular investment category may shrink or disappear suddenly and without warning the noninvestment grade bond market can experience sudden and sharp price swings and become illiquid due to a variety of factors including changes in economic forecasts stock market activity large sustained sales by major investors a high profile default or a change in the markets psychology credit risk this is the risk that the issuer the guarantor or the insurer of a fixed income security or the counterparty to a contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal and interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations additionally the securities could lose value due to a loss of confidence in the ability of the issuer guarantor insurer or counterparty to pay back debt the longer the maturity and the lower the credit quality of a bond the more sensitive it is to credit risk derivatives risk derivatives involve special risks and costs and may result in losses to the fund the successful use of derivatives requires sophisticated management and to the extent that derivatives are used the fund will depend on the subadviser’s ability to analyze and manage derivatives transactions the prices of derivatives may move in unexpected ways especially in abnormal market conditions some derivatives are “leveraged” and therefore may magnify or otherwise increase investment losses to the fund the fund’s use of derivatives may also increase the amount of taxes payable by shareholders other risks arise from the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions a liquid secondary market may not always exist for the fund’s derivatives positions in fact many overthecounter derivative instruments will not have liquidity beyond the counterparty to the instrument overthecounter derivative instruments also involve the risk that the other party will not meet its obligations to the fund market risk securities markets may be volatile and the market prices of the fund’s securities may decline securities fluctuate in price based on changes in an issuer’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions if the market prices of the securities owned by the fund fall the value of your investment in the fund will decline foreign securities risk investments in securities of nonus issuers including those denominated in us dollars generally involve more risk than investing in securities of us issuers foreign political economic and legal systems especially those in developing and emerging market countries may be less stable and more volatile than in the us foreign legal systems generally have fewer regulatory requirements than the us legal system in general less information is publicly available about nonus companies than about us companies nonus companies generally are not subject to the same accounting auditing and financial reporting standards as are us companies additionally the changing value of foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates could also affect the value of the assets the fund holds and the funds performance certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal and interest or dividends to investors located outside the country due to blockage of foreign currency exchanges or otherwise investments in emerging markets are subject to greater volatility and price declines in addition the funds investments in nonus securities may be subject to the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of nonus currency confiscatory taxation and adverse diplomatic developments special us tax considerations may apply emerging markets risk the risks of nonus investments are greater for investments in emerging markets emerging market countries typically have economic and political systems that are less fully developed and can be expected to be less stable than those of more developed countries for example the economies of such countries can be subject to rapid and unpredictable rates of inflation or deflation low trading volumes may result in a lack of liquidity and price volatility emerging market countries may have policies that restrict investment by nonus investors or that prevent nonus investors from withdrawing their money at will interest rate risk the value of your investment may go down when interest rates rise a rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or duration securities when interest rates fall the issuers of debt obligations may prepay principal more quickly than expected and the fund may be required to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate this is referred to as “ prepayment risk ” when interest rates rise debt obligations may be repaid more slowly than expected and the value of the funds holdings may fall sharply this is referred to as “ extension risk ” the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low rates the fund may lose money if shortterm or longterm interest rates rise sharply or in a manner not anticipated by the subadviser management risk the value of your investment may decrease if judgments by the subadviser about the attractiveness value or market trends affecting a particular security industry or sector or about market movements are incorrect liquidity risk the fund may invest in instruments that trade in lower volumes and are less liquid than other investments liquidity risk exists when particular investments made by the fund are difficult to purchase or sell liquidity risk also includes the risk that the fund may make investments that may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions if the fund is forced to sell these investments to pay redemption proceeds or for other reasons the fund may lose money in addition when there is no willing buyer and investments cannot be readily sold at the desired time or price the fund may have to accept a lower price or may not be able to sell the instrument at all an inability to sell a portfolio position can adversely affect the funds value or prevent the fund from being able to take advantage of other investment opportunities market events events in the financial markets have resulted in and may continue to result in an unusually high degree of volatility both in nonus and us markets this market volatility in addition to reduced liquidity in credit and fixed income markets may adversely affect issuers worldwide furthermore the impact of policy and legislative changes in the us and other countries may not be fully known for some time this environment could make identifying investment risks and opportunities especially difficult for the subadviser risk of increase in expenses your actual cost of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in the expense table for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if average net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile active and frequent trading of fund securities can increase expenses more information about the risks of investing in the fund appears in the
