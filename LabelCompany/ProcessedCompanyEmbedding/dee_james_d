imagination to dream up and the energy to carry out someone at unc asheville will let you do” that truth has made my life at unc asheville even during my undergraduate days here rich challenging and sometimes frustrating but always fascinating and full my interest in stories—yours mine ours—is at the heart of my teaching i believe that searching for and giving expression to our stories will help us discover and better understand ourselves and others as a teacher of writing i try to help my students give voice to the stories they are a part of as well as the stories they find around them i believe that searching out those stories and using them to communicate ideas is an effective means for developing analytical skills as much as creative skills my training and interest in ethnography has underscored the importance of the relationship between academic inquiry and story in the effort to search out stories and to craft them my students also refine their skills of observation and communication my work as a teacher of writing and literature is further shaped by my commitment to the liberal arts seeking out connections in unexpected places alert to complexity and contradiction likewise my scholarship and service to the department and the university are driven by my goals as a teacher and informed by my understanding of a liberal arts education a significant part of my understanding of liberal arts drives my participation in developing and helping sustain an inclusive community my intellectual interests are mirrored in the work i do here besides teaching in the
