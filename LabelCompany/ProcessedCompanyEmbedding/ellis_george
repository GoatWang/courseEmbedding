engineering at kollmorgen corporation a leading provider of precision motion systems around the globe for  years he has worked in product development including leading product development projects designing development processes and creating portfolio management systems he has also written two wellrespected books with elsevier control system design guide now in its fourth edition and observers in control systems he has contributed articles to numerous magazines including electronic design news machine design control engineering motion systems design and power control and intelligent motion affiliations and expertise kollmorgen corporation usa reviews everyone recognizes the importance of sustainable innovation for any growing business  less well understood is the vital role outstanding project management plays in innovative businesses  our approach to project management at danaher evolved greatly over the last two decades and played no small part in our success  george ellis nicely captures the state of the art and demonstrates how process alone is not enough – true total leadership in project management differentiates the winners from the runnersup  if you want to win the innovation game read his book lawrence culp jr former ceo danaher corporation tools for project management have expanded over the years most recently agile methods as applied to software development and lean methods adopted from manufacturing earlier additions include criticalchain and phasegate methodologies many fine books cover each of these but none covers them all ellis does as well as traditional waterfallcritical path methods especially valuable is ellis’ comparison of the methods their relative strengths and weaknesses where each applies and doesn’t apply along the way he reminds us of the importance of leadership and interpersonal skills in project management by way of interesting side comments and bits of advice for dealing with technical specialists customers and bosses all of this separates ellis’ book from and puts it above the rest in project management john nicholas professor quinlan school of business loyola university chicago based on his many years of practical experience george ellis tackles an application area of project management that is rarely covered this book is a very downtoearth and thorough exposition rather than being theoretical and academic it is well illustrated with lists tables charts and explanatory diagrams as well as techniques such as critical path management it delves into phasegate management agile project management lean product development risk and patents issues all in the context of product development ellis also emphasizes the importance of looking upon project management as a leadership responsibility rather than just an administrative position this book is a valuable addition to any product development managers reference library r max wideman fpmi richmond hill ontario canada the section on patent law is at the right
