daily brief richard j kerr and peter dixon davis the presidential election of  was over and it was the morning after in cias office of current operations we knew that a new boss and a new set of customers had us in their sights ronald reagan would be in the white house by the end of january and a republican team of national security officials would be calling the shots cia would have a new director of central intelligence dci he would bring in a new deputy there probably would be other new faces at the top of cia and a new set of staff weenies would appear as well déjà vu all over again so it seemed to us here we were the director and deputy director of the office of current intelligence and we faced another new administration another foreign policy team another group to which we had to prove ourselves all over again but while we were veterans of such transitions neither of us had grown so jaded or so weary of trying to convince our customers of the value of intelligence that we did not warm to the possibility of new experiences we were at once stimulated by the prospect of change and challenged by the problems we clearly had to overcome it would not be easy but it would be exciting the task sounded straightforward if you had no experience trying to do it providing a daily report of current intelligence to the president and his national security team that was comprehensive offered information and analysis not available from other sources and helped rather than frustrated the policymaking process we knew that in the confusion of changing administrations establishing daily intelligence support at top levels of a wary new leadership might just as likely be resisted as welcomed at the same time this new group valued intelligence the question was whether they thought cia was up to the task how would we be received by a palace guard that at times had appeared downright hostile it was not as though we had not been warned the campaign just ended had been a rough one with cia taking its knocks and intelligence performance generally getting poor marks from a range of republican critics of the carter administrations handling of our business our track record with presidents moreover was not encouraging we had spent the past few years trying to divine exactly what president carter wanted in the way of current supportthe feedback was as mixed as it was sparseand we were never sure our efforts were on the mark he eventually took time to visit headquarters and thank us specifically for the presidents daily brief pdb but we were not convinced that he really valued it our experience with a number of administrations was that they started with the expectation that intelligence could solve every problem or that it could not do anything right and then moved to the opposite view then they settled down and vacillated from one extreme to the other ronald reagan gave us pause the nature of his views and his lack of experience in dealing with foreign policy issues left us even less certain what kind of support would interest him or what he would accept we could not have imagined then that soon we would be having daily oneonone access to the highest level first we would have to contend with reagans foreign policy advisers whose words and actions during the campaign likewise inspired little confidence in the cias future william casey richard allen fred ikle frank gaffney michael pillsbury and angelo codevilla all were strong critics of intelligence performance establishing contact with the transition team president carter made the first move he directed that the pdb be made available immediately to the presidentelect and vice presidentelect so that they would be getting the same information as those responsible for national security until the inauguration the first contact with the new team was made in a telephone call from richard lehman who had been the director of the office of current intelligence during previous transitions to richard allen the following day kerr accompanied lehman to the transition headquarters in washington the meeting was brief and businesslike and clearly placed allen as our point of contact it also was clear that he wanted no regular contact with dci turner or anyone else in the current leadership he preferred as the presidentelects designee that we serve him directly and that he be the channel for any required intelligence support to our knowledge he did not have any regular contact with others in cia during the transition period from that first day we were pretty much on our own in setting up all subsequent briefing sessions with the three incoming occupants of the white house and in arranging for their intelligence support the briefings begin the process began almost immediately with a series of briefings of allen held in his washington business office in cars and at the madison hotel over breakfast he was shown the pdb and other current reports on the full range of intelligence issues we also provided special memorandums in response to his various requests allen was an avid customer almost from the first day there was never any question about his view of our loyalty we worked for him and the new administration it was an interesting situation we were still producing the pdb for president carter although we had no contact with him or with senior officials in the administration the incoming group had captured all our attention and there were still nearly three months to go before the inauguration the briefings entered a new phase when the presidentelect and the vice presidentelect made their first visit to washington in midnovember during their week in town allen set up a couple of meetings with presidentelect reagan at his blair house quarters at the same time we began daily briefings of vice presidentelect bush who was staying around the corner at the jackson place townhouse reserved for former presidents the sessions with reagan had to compete with the extraordinary press of business awaiting the new chief executive they were tightly structured and intelligence issues were not central allen used the meetings to conduct a good deal of general business the sessions with bush were quite different as a former dci with whom we had had some previous contact he was a customer of a different sort his briefings were informal animated and extended well beyond the substance of the pdb arrangements were handled directly facilitated by the fact that bushs executive assistant was also a former colleague at the end of that week as reagan and bush prepared to return to los angeles and houston respectively things took an interesting turn influenced by his experience as dci and un ambassador and his familiarity with intelligence processes and people bush had ruminated on several occasions about the need to bring reagan into the current analytic stream as quickly as possible he felt it was imperative that the newly elected president receive daily briefings based on the pdb andeven more importantthat a professional intelligence officer be present to answer any questions provide background information and follow up on whatever intelligence needs reagan might have bush knew from firsthand experience that filtering went on as an intelligence product moved through the white house staff and on to the president he also knew that to make intelligence relevant the agency needed regular feedback from its key customers it seemed a good opportunity given bushs candor and friendly disposition toward the agency to make a bold recommendation because he was scheduled in a few hours to ride along with reagan to andrews air force base perhaps he might want to urge his new boss to request that such daily briefings be provided him personally during the period he remained in california pending the inauguration bush told davis he would give it a try shortly after reagans takeoff that afternoon a message from the plane arrived at cia headquarters ed meese asked that a cia briefer be prepared to present the pdb to the presidentelect at his home in pacific palisades the following morning a few hours later after hurriedly arranging for daily transmission of the pdb to an agency facility in los angeles kerr was on a plane to the west coast opening a second front now we were operating on both coasts we used an agency facility that had secure communications and kerr set up business in a vault the time difference helped because there was an opportunity for kerr to read the pdb and then call on a secure line to ask questions and get additional information davis directed the production process in washingtonselecting items for the book sharpening the judgments and getting the supporting information that was needed to understand complicated issues that might end up being treated in a paragraph in the pdb although we were the front men in this drama it was an agencywide effort obviously the country and technical analysts in the directorate of intelligence provided the daily product and responded to the wide range of questions photo interpreters technical experts in the directorate of science and technology foreign broadcast information service specialists and the clandestine collectors in the directorate of operations provided the grist for this effort without a highquality product and an organization that could respond quickly to questions and crises this briefing process would not have gotten off the ground the team that put together the pdb every afternoon and evening was extraordinary jim mccullough chuck peters gail solin and ray mcgovern comprised a group of sophisticated analysts with a keen sense of the issues that the customers would or should be interested in all were to become briefers when the number of our customers expanded after inauguration into the lions den kerr had no idea of what to expect at reagans house in pacific palisades a cast of thousands secret service a mile deep and a palace of a residence no nothing of the kind the cia security officer supporting kerr had located the house the previous day driving up the narrow road to the residence the only sign of something unusual was that the driveway was closed off a modest house looking a bit rundown was the first impression a secret service agent approached and kerr showed him a cia identification card saying he was there to brief the presidentelect no passes no search no questions and no horseholders he went into the recreation room on the lower floor and told a young woman in the makeshift office space that he was there for the intelligence briefing a man introduced himself as responsible for security and escorted him to the main floor he suggested that he probably should sit in on the briefing when told it was for reagan only he just nodded and went to find him a minute later the future president came out in his bathrobe we went into the breakfast area and he introduced mrs reagan a dog sat next to the table it was very casual and domestic reagan offered coffee and we went into the den he read the pdb carefully asking an occasional question and then read the other material we talked briefly about the briefing process and what type of material he would like to see he agreed that unless there was some pressing engagement an early morning briefing would work best with no further ado the pattern was set during the remainder of the transition each week we rotated the briefing and editorial duties on the west and east coasts the briefing sessions in california continued every morning much as they had that first day davis being received with equally little fuss by an attentive and gracious mr reagan and a watchful but friendly mrs reagan reagan as customer during the holiday period the presidentelect was as diligent as ever in keeping up his briefing schedule breaking off only for christmas and for a quick trip to palm springs for the traditional new years eve party at the walter annenbergs returning the next day he even agreed to meet davis in the late afternoon for a catchup session one lesson learned that day reagan was a morning person not an afternoon person as a rule reagan was a studious reader going over each item deliberately and with considerable concentration it was common knowledge that he had pretty fixed views on such subjects as the soviet union european diplomacy and israel butsomewhat to our surprisehe showed no impatience or disdain with analysis that presented a different view in contrast to allen for example there was little tendency to challenge or dispute our line of thinking if he was skeptical he rarely showed it rather the door seemed to be open to new ideas even if they were not welcome or necessarily accepted and despite the serious approach to the material there were more than a few flashes of the reagan humor he was in short an interested cordial and somewhat baffling customer because of reagans willingness and patience in reading items we called to his attention we were frank about the product we were careful to point out articles that were light on facts as well as those where the analysis was superficial or a bit naïve it was not uncommon for us to comment on a particular piece that we really do not know much about this particular development the daily routine was interrupted only for a second visit to washington in midjanuary when we returned to the earlier pattern of briefing allen reagan and bush at their pennsylvania avenue quarters on reagans return to california davis accompanied the presidential party on what was deemed an inappropriately humble military aircrafta dc midway in the flight he was invited to join reagan in the forward cabin to review the days pdb and to go over a special memorandum on factional splits in the palestinian leadership this turned into a more extended session than usual giving the presidentelect an opportunity to raise a number of questions on issues of priority interest to him iran and the hostage situation were uppermost in our minds throughout the transition reagans concern for the embassy hostages was acute and he absorbed whatever raw and finished intelligence we were able to offer on the subject briefers on the inside   perhaps the most interesting aspect of the briefing process was the relationship that developed between both of us on the one hand and those we briefed often during briefings or while we waited during telephone calls or other visitations we overheard conversations between reagan or bush and potential cabinet members or advisers we listened to discussions of their strengths and weaknesses complaints and personal exchanges that clearly were not meant for outsiders ears we also watched the courting process and the beginning of what would become the pecking order for those around the president we were accepted as part of the scenerytrusted without any apparent reservations they seemed in fact to trust us with sensitive personal information in the same way we trusted them with the most sensitive intelligence equally striking was the degree to which we were given a free hand during this twomonth period of direct contact with a top leadership that would eventually include secretary of defensedesignate caspar weinberger and secretary of statedesignate alexander haig as well as reagan bush and allen we had little supervision from officials within the cia or the carter administration another interesting feature of this period was that to our knowledge reagan bush and allen did not receive formal regular briefings from any other part of the government there were contacts with state and defense but nothing like the type of regular contact we had established the lack of contact between us and william casey who was to become dci was also noteworthy at most kerr would exchange good morning greetings with bill casey to whom he had been introduced by reagan casey usually was with a group of senior advisers waiting for the intelligence briefing to end outside reagans den he clearly was not worried about what we were saying similarly dci turner never asked us what was going on direction from cia leadership after the initial contact with richard lehman we were largely on our own we reported back to bruce c clarke jr the deputy director of intelligence ddiour immediate bossand kept him informed about what we were doing and what questions were being asked we directed most of the tasking for papers or information that we got from the principals or from allen to the appropriate offices in cia and we kept cia leaders informed of our activity by a daily memorandum one thing we decided early on was that we were not going to report on the conversations we participated in or overheard or the personal reactions or comments of those we were briefing unless it directly related to intelligence support consequently we kept our daily reports clear of any gossip or personal information that turned out to be a wise decision neither of us received any clear instructions about these briefings of the prospective president vice president national security adviser and others we would be involved with other than not to screw it up bruce clarkes most explicit instruction to kerr before the first briefing was get a black belt to go with that blue suitthe brown one is not appropriate he bought a black belt davis did not need such basic instruction he still had the proper black attache case he had used at the vietnam peace talks in paris doing daily duty with ambassadors harriman vance and lodge the confidence that bruce clarke had in us was not unexpected he had been kerrs mentor for nearly  years and was an extraordinary intelligence officer some of his instruction had stuck putting it all together   we are convinced that this two month period of private briefings gave the new administration a degree of confidence in the ability and loyalty of cia that would not have been possible if the initial contact had been limited to those few more formal briefings mentioned by former ddi john helgerson in his  book cia briefings of presidential candidates our worst fears about the more extreme critics tearing cia apart when the new administration came in proved groundless some of the credit goes to this briefing effort bushs success in convincing reagan that regular briefings were important and reagans instructions that the secretaries of state and defense receive the pdb were key finally it was clear that bill casey was going to shape cia along his own lines not on the basis of transition team recommendations looking back on the transition experience it seems hard to believe that things fell into place so simply and with so little bureaucratic folderol and that the process had such lasting results the system that evolved was as unprecedented as it was unpredictable a review of the more striking short and longterm features may be useful   there was no previous model or rules of procedures to guide us in meeting needs and exploiting opportunities as they arose   the system was planned only in the sense that we knew how we could help incoming officials if only they would let us and we had some sense of how they could help us   the support was geared to respond quickly to whatever we felt the situation called for   the daytoday personal contact enabled us in ad hoc fashion to tailor the support   requirements were not filtered they were received directly continually and from the top level   there was virtually no intervention by intelligence overseers representing either the incoming or outgoing administrations   the transition team of incoming intelligence advisers installed at the agency was out of the loop having no contact with us and possibly not being aware of the support we were providing and to whom this unusual circumstance did not seem to bother their bosses   agency supervisors monitored the activity but refrained from directing it the senior leadership deserved a good deal of credit for giving people the responsibility and then supporting them without a lot of handwringing   the presidentelect the vice presidentelect and the national security adviserdesignate did not to our knowledge receive regular formal briefings from any other part of the government we appeared to be the only professional us government officials in continuing contact with these vips   by inauguration day the daily briefing system was so well established that it seemed natural to all involved that it would simply continue the question hardly arose it seemed a fait accompli at president reagans direction the service was to be provided also to secretary of state haig and secretary of defense weinberger george shultz and william clark became recipients when they replaced haig and allen respectively the agency had finally obtained the continuing highlevel access it had been seeking since    it seems reasonable to assume that the daily cabinetlevel briefings that were provided and welcomed throughout the reagan and bush administrations would not have become such a regular fixture without the precedent of personal briefings during those extraordinary transition months of                        as career current intelligence practitioners we were in the right place at the right time and we had the best professional products in the business if we deserve any plaudits for playing our roles well we are quick to bow to an able supporting cast and to our indulgent customers   editors note coauthor peter dixon davis provided former president bush with a copy of this article whose response is quoted below in part your article brought back a lot of happy memories and made me realize once again how lucky i was to have the pdb as vp and then as president and how grateful i am and will always be for the work that went into preparing the pdb i read it religiously without fail and i hope the record will show that we protected the pdb from wide distribution and from careless handling     richard j kerr is a former deputy director of central

hearingsintelligence and security richard j kerr former deputy director of central intelligence house intelligence committee november   mr chairman members of the committee and staff i welcome the opportunity to appear at this hearing to discuss the intelligence community i spent  years in a wide variety of assignments in cia and intelligence community and retain my strong interest in those organizations and in the profession of intelligence this is a difficult period for cia and a tough time for someone to argue its merits but i am proud to have worked at cia for thirty plus years the agency did some extraordinary things for this country i was part of those successes i do regret some of the things i did not do some of the questions i did not ask some of the actions i did not take as to personal responsibility i am a product of cias culture and i influenced that culture i share its credit for what it did well and share the blame for its shortcomings given the chance to offer personal views on the intelligence community it is tempting to range widely and address all aspects of the business of intelligencethe implications of the end of the cold war the national security problems now facing the us and the full range of intelligence activitiesfrom rd through the various collection disciplines and into finished intelligence i believe however it is worthwhile to focus on a few key issues and some ideas for how to improve performance in the future i also plan to center my comments on cia it is in real trouble and is the core of most debate that does not mean that i believe the nsa security agency and the national reconnaissance office and other elements of the intelligence community are unimportant but i will leave them for another discussion finally i am not going to spend a lot of time on past shortcomingsthere are already too many experts and amateurs wallowing about in that area i would like to address five issues  the need for a strong independent central intelligence agency and some concerns about the increasing dominance of the department of defense  concerns about the clandestine service of cia  oversight and management of the intelligence community  analysis and the customer  economic security and intelligence a central intelligence organization general an organization that reports to the president and supports the national security agencies and departments as well as congress but has no direct ties to policy making organizations is crucial it can provide information and judgments that are not colored by commitment to a particular outcome such an organization also can be an advocate for intelligence programs that are national in nature and do not just serve a particular military service or agency some observations i believe that the director of the central intelligence agency who is also the director of central intelligence should not serve a specific term the position should be filled by someone chosen by the president and who is a peer of other key policy makers in the national security arena line officers in the cia should be intelligence professionals the deputy director of cia should be an intelligence professional possibly from the clandestine service i am not arguing that no one from the outside can be brought in but key line jobs like the heads of the military servicesshould be held by professional officers intelligence is a profession being independent is not enough to be effective cia must have cloutclout with other organizations that compete for influence and money especially the defense and state departments authority overseas as the focal point for activities and liaison leadership in rd and the procurement of intelligence collection systems and a real claim as the premier analytic organization are key attributes over the past few years cia appears to be treated as just another unit in the intelligence community the intelligence community staff dci centers for narcotics terrorism and nonproliferation were set up at the expense of cia central role defense in particular has been given control of more and more activities where cia once played an important if not dominant role the imagery business is the most striking example but there are many cia currently appears to be just another agency in the defense budget process cia is just one of several organizations that compete for influence overseas  a situation that must delight and confuse our foreign partners and targets much of the current debate about intelligence addresses the issue of dci authorities a strong and independent central intelligence organization is at the core of dci authority the emphasis on support to military operations has been healthy the bloody end of the stick the point of the spear getting the intelligence to the warfighter are good slogans and sound principles most of expensive technical collection systems are justified because they support the military in war consequently the military should have a strong voice in what must support military operations but it has other objectives that are equally importantproviding intelligence and supporting activities aimed at avoiding the use of military forces and addressing the complex set of issues outside the military sphere covert and political action under the control of a civilian intelligence organization probably is more important now than at any time since the end of wwii it appears that the capability and will to conduct such activity is woefully lacking when it comes to imposing us will we are more comfortable sending fighter aircraft to strike targets than using covert military or political action to influence the outcome covert action is a useful tool only when it is part of a much broader and integrated policy initiative political actions is not a panacea and requires a clearly developed objectives accepting these conditions covert action is an instrument of the us in my judgement paramilitary covert actions should be run by a civilian organization heavy involvement by the defense intelligence agency in clandestine operations is a mistakenot just for the nation but for dod the clandestine operations business is filled with pitfalls requires a major infrastructure and oversight protection of overseas facilities and preparation of the battle field are legitimate areas but it is not hard to imagine cia dia and the fbi running into each other on a regular basis only to acquire marginal information it also is easy to imagines the secretary of defense spending a lot of time on the hill explaining what went wrong one additional point on defense and intelligence without cia and support from civilians outside cia imagery satellites the u and the sr would not have been so aggressively pursued the military services necessarily focus on their own interests and enhancements that help their forces they have not been major supporters of national programs until they found they could not do without them defense also will eat up all the collection resources to support current crises it is important to have a strong civilian organization that competes for these resource operating from a different set of priorities cia needs to revitalize itself as a technological leader while it may not drive technology today it can take the lead in applying commercial technology to intelligence with streamline procedures and a minimum of bureaucracy the clandestine service general the most distinctive feature of cia other than its independence form policy elements is the clandestine service technical collection and analysis are conducted by a variety of organizations the recruitment of agents the conduct of paramilitary and political action to support us policy are activities that each require special set of rules a special group of people to conduct them and a special type of oversight the present capabilities and practices in each of these categories are seriously flawed the current leadership is making important changes but progress is slow some observations the clandestine service of the cold war does not serve present needs it probably got too big too walled off and too isolated much of its cultureindependence and flexibilitymust be maintained but like the us military after vietnam it needs an overhaul introducing rules directives and structure may make the senior managers fell more comfortable but a clear statement of mission training and new creative ideas that originate inside the organization probably are most critical most important is strong leadership from within cutting back on the number of clandestine stations overseas and cutting back the state department presence makes little sense regular contact with foreign governments the elite in a country the opposition and future leaders is a primary task of cia overseas these activities are not substitutes for diplomatic presence but additive and involve people and relationships that are different than those of state it also is useful to have lines of contact open when diplomatic channels are clogged or strained the clandestine service needs to be world wide our ability to predict where the next crisis will occur is not particularly good targets of the clandestine service have changed recruitment of agents of real or potential adversaries is still of prime importance but in most countries access to those with influence whether they are controlled agents or not is equally valuable being in the right place and having entree to the right circles is extremely valuable we need to reassess what is valued about officers in the clandestine service there will be increasing need to work in teams and in task forces more and more of our business is going to be done by multi disciplinary teams targeted on specific problems and missions that does not mean that we should make generalists our of all case officers  tradecraft and experience in operations remain key the clandestine service has not valued assignments outside its core activities over the past ten years or so senior executive positions in the agency were usually filled by officers from the directorate of intelligence officers from that organization usually had served in a variety of positions inside and outside cia the career promotion boards in the clandestine service did not credit work outside the service having ddi fill most senior officers in cia meant there were real gaps in knowledge about how the clandestine service functioned they were not in a strong position to question how things were done i have specific examples in officers from the clandestine service that worked as special assistants when i was ddci they were not credited for that assignment by their promotion panels overnight and management of the intelligence community general this is a subject on which it is easy to pontificate all of the old chestnuts appear the simple fact is that managing a large secret organization that does illegal things overseas is difficult and risky cia has had some exceptional managers and even they have gotten into problems the agency officers reprimanded because of their involvement in irancontra guatemala and the ames case had impressive careers and were among the most impressive people i have met inside or outside government i believe that says something about the difficulty of the job management the dcis primary management team is composed of the director of nsa the director of dia the director of the nro the head of inr and often someone from the cia other than the dci or ddci this group cannot provide strong advice on issues that affect the intelligence community as a whole because their interest necessarily must be driven by the interests of their own organizations cia tends to be the loser in this process because it is not represented by its headthe dci must be seen as ecumenical the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board is not an important source of support for the intelligence community or a valued critic it does not seem to carry weight with the national security advisor or the president and it has little visibility in technical circles or in congress it might be useful to create a real board of directors to advise the dci while it is not customary for advisory boards in government to have much clout there is no reason why a board drawn from industry academia retired military and intelligence officers information gurus and scientists could not be given some authority for directing the intelligence community and cia in particular it could have direct impact on new programs and personnel appointments it could give on programs and activities it could be both an internal critic and an external supporter oversight there is no question that an organization that has special authorities and operates in secret needs strong oversightby its own inspector general by the executive and by congress but oversight is more than a search for any violation of the rules or the law it should also be advocacy good oversight should identify what went right as well as what went wrong i understand why the oversight committees are angry about not being kept well informedthey have assumed that responsibility for their fellow members and feel hung out when some flap occurs on a situation about which they are not up to speed but sometimes what happens to them becomes more important that how well cia does in accomplishing its fundamental mission oversight should involve assessing the impact of intelligence on policy the question of whether the mexican financial crisis was well covered by intelligence probably is as important as transgressions in guatemala the quality of policy and the impact of intelligence on that policy are important questions that need to be addressed has cia had an impact on us policy in bosnia if so why doesnt someone say so if not why isnt that the subject of review oversight itself needs to be reexamined now after  years of proliferating organs and activities the way we do oversight today is not consistent with a serious effective intelligence effort over the long haul it had gotten too political too publicity prone and lines of responsibility are too confused it is time to examine the executive orders laws and directives that bear on clandestine operations and on other aspects of intelligence although i am not a fan of blue ribbon panels a group of former legislators some legal experts some retired clandestine service officers and others could develop a comprehensive package for consideration by the executive and congress strong oversight but enabling clear and concise direction that gives guidance but provides the maximum flexibility analysis and the customer in my judgment the directorate of intelligence continues to provide outstanding support to its customers but the requirement to cover more and more subjects while cutting manpower jeopardize its ability to do serious in depth analysis one of the basic questions posed about analysis is whether cia should become a reference service for the us government or focus just on those areas where secret information is key the answer is neither cia must address those subjects that engaged or should engage policymakers that means intelligence will need to be positioned to respond to a wide range of questionseconomic political social and military obviously there are prioritiesnuclear proliferation gets more attention than economic trends in africa but the role for south africa in the economy of subsaharan africa deserves attention both problems require a broad flow of information experienced analysts and interested customers some observations although some critics argue that the importance of technical intelligence went south with the end of the cold war nothing could be farther from the truth today a number of countries sell advanced weapons systems and the support to go with them in the open market some very sophisticated threats can be put in place rapidly this poses a real challenge to intelligence the answers are not available just by reading the sales brochures in this age of one liner many believe that information equates to understanding continuity and experience still count for something experienced analysts with a deep sense of history and access to the full range of classified and open source information are key to serving the policy maker the capital stock of expertise needed for deep analysis is being depleted the current written product of ciacurrent intelligence research products and estimatesneed updating the customers should get a product tailored to their needs they should be offered some choices in how they received information they should be able to talk to key analysts consideration should be given to resurrecting the national intelligence survey program that provided detailed country by country information on subjects ranging from geography to financial systems such a program run by cia with participation of the dod and other agencies would provide an important base of information for the entire government teaming with the outside world is imperative national estimates should be drafted by floating teams of experts drawn from the press academia the business and scientific worlds andeven foreign experts perhaps the major challenge is to tap all the sources of information and integrate them into the final product information systems and analytic techniques to help the analyst move through this maze are slow coming and will cost a bundle but they are worth the time and money while surfing the net is the current fad intelligence must focus on national security policy that deals with sensitive and often dangerous issues there must be security and controlnot strong points of the internet world cia should continue to be in the military analysis business it is important that alternative views about the military threat and effectiveness of us military operations be available cia should maintain an independent imagery analysis organization it should be in a position to assess the impact of the air strikes in bosnia it should be deeply involved in assessing the implications of introducing nato ground forces into the region this type of analysis makes military planners and policy makers uncomfortable certainly if done in public or used for political purposes by the congress it can be destructive but issues like this are too important not to use the full resources of the government economic security cia state treasury and commerce do a good job in supporting the us during economic negotiations and on issues that are primarily driven by government policy and actions it is less clear that these organizations help us industry to compete abroad economic intelligence is controversial because the debate often focuses on economic espionage economic security is too important to be left solely to the interested departments like treasury commerce and the ustr more can be done to support the interests of the us in the area of economic analysis some consideration should be given to establishing a partnership between ciam a university and some private or federally funded group the objective would be systematic all source analysis of current or prospective economic issues that analysis could be based on classified and unclassified information and be made available to government and in some sanitized form to the private sector an example of the work that could be done vietnam a broad body of information should be available to the us government and potential investors for example information on the current infrastructure or lack thereof  telecommunications electric power transportation banking an finance and labor in addition information on the basic strategies of other countries how are they investing where and how do they arrange credit buy land hire labor contract for services who are the principal players is this the job of the cia i believe so cri   kerr richard j about gpo      newsroommedia      congressional relations      inspector general
