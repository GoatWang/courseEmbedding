share print clip gift article comments rupert murdoch’s newspapers which will spin off from his st century fox entertainment businesses on friday are becoming “platforms” from which to launch products for smartphones digital subscribers and international markets according to the new news corp’s chief executive robert thomson predicted “a year or two – no more – of transformation” including “astute and acute” costcutting investment in digital initiatives and collaborations between divisions “these papers are no longer newspapers they’re platforms” he told the financial times moreon this topic

popularity of wireless speakers helps npr find its voice again harry potter and the business of wizarding turkish filmmakers fear the spectre of censorship advertising agencies squeezed by tech giantshe declined to echo mr murdoch’s statement last year that print losses would no longer be tolerated and would not detail the scale of planned job cuts from the integration of dow jones and the wall street journal but said the company’s titles must become more profitable the new company whose assets range from a us coupons company to foxtel paytv in australia was working on projects including a plan for the new york post to compete nationally with digital news and entertainment brands such as buzzfeed he disclosed “some of the most successful recent startups are basically ersatz tabloid journalism” he said “if we can’t do it better than they can then we’re not as good as we think we are” its uk papers were looking to repackage their football coverage for fans in asia and latin america “britain is to football what saudi arabia is to oil and we have a gusher coming out of london of fantastic football content” harpercollins the publisher was similarly talking to executives from the wall street journal and amplify its nascent digital education business about products for teaching business english and translations of english books to sell from the journal’s website in china amplify built from ’s m acquisition of wireless generation is expected to lose m this year mr thomson described its plan to create a digital curriculum for school maths english and science as “an expensive proposition” but one with a potential bn market opportunity news corp competes with pearson owner of the financial times in financial news publishing and education news corp has made past attempts to encourage its brands to share content and he acknowledged that many media companies had failed to achieve the synergy benefits they touted “almost to use the word synergy is a sin because it’s been so overused and abused” he said but said that the smaller company would encourage a stronger focus on collaboration “we will have a single cost of content and multiple opportunities to profit by repurposing it” he said mr thomson defended print newspapers as “ever more premium” means for advertisers to reach highly engaged readers but said it now planned to use its scale in markets like the uk to secure reader offers from retailers and others to sweeten digital subscription packages mr thomson the former managing editor of the wall street journal and a onetime us managing editor of the ft said it had been “less clear” how massmarket newspapers could charge online when so much general news was available for free but described the planned promotions for digital subscribers as a solution at a time when commoditised content was putting advertising rates were under “enormous” pressure “you’ll be creating a popular paper demographic which is a paying demographic” he confirmed that news corp could use its bn of net cash for acquisitions adding that it could borrow more if needed he played down expectations of a bid for another newspaper such as the los angeles times any acquisition must complement existing assets he added “we can’t buy something for it to exist in splendid isolation” deals and investments could expand its exposure to latin america or asian markets from china to vietnam he added acquisitions could help dow jones sharpen its rivalry with bloomberg and thomson reuters build on the rea online classifieds business in australia or provide sports content for “second screen” mobile devices echoing its recent premier league rights deal in the uk he said the spinoff takes place almost two years after news corp closed the news of the world over phone hacking at the uk sunday tabloid mr thomson predicted “a certain amount of publicity over the coming months” as former editors and reporters including rebekah brooks and andy coulson face trial but said news corp had invested heavily in compliance since adding “one must presume innocence until or unless proven guilty” related topicsunited states of americaunited
