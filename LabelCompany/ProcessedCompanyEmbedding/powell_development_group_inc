groups top hat   condom concepts that could make safe sex better  mens journal gallery  condom concepts that could make safe sex better  getty images by taylor kubota powell development groups top hat in the second round of the gates foundations grants for the next generation condom they specified that they would not award funding to any condoms that offer only partial coverage the reasoning behind this is that many stds can be transmitted through skintoskin contact however charles powell president and ceo of powell development group inc thinks the avoidance of partial coverage condoms is a massive oversight he is developing a condom called the galactic cap which covers only the head of the penis leaving the coronal ridge and shaft exposed for skintoskin sensation the galactic cap is polyurethane cap that is fixed to the penis with a preapplied adhesive strip which makes an airtight reservoir over the head since he was ineligible for gates foundation funding powell has now turned to indiegogo for support which he is optimistic about theyre going to cover the full penis and thats like so what what weve got is the biggest design advance in over  years he says although full condoms may be better for riskier situations powell sees his invention as a potential third option between traditional condoms and no condom at all back to top previous slide next slide trending
