rosenthal billy’s keyboardist and music director has carefully arranged all the tracks from joel’s classic  release to combine the piano parts and vocal melodies into playable arrangements while transcribing those classic piano parts that are integral to each song this book features the iconic title track and nine others ain’t no crime • the ballad of billy the kid • captain jack • if i only had the words to tell you • somewhere along the line • stop in nevada • travelin’ prayer • worse comes to worst • you’re my home also includes a foreword by david rosenthal review from keyboard magazine why are we reviewing sheet music in  for the  album that put billy joel on the map because this isn’t your parents’ billy joel songbook retail sheet music sometimes omits or shortens solos oversimplifies chords and otherwise bastardizes how the artist really played the song so joel asked his longtime keyboardist and band director david rosenthal to go over his entire catalog correcting or sometimes entirely retranscribing each piece this is the first fruit of that labor and joel’s signature intros solos and flourishes are among the elements that are reproduced with loving detail and pinpoint accuracy on songs where the original instrumentation was other than piano rosenthal has devised piano arrangements that sound great while still making room for any piano parts joel played note for note we’ve always known rosenthal to be a perfectionist and here that has created a new platinum standard for pianovocal songbooks it’s like discovering these songs all over again  copyright
