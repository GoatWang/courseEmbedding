on  may    reply  sharks posts  member since  feb  there has been unrest among the htc staff since a few years last year there were massive layoffs in the htc factories i really believe the board of directors need to remodel their thinking on whats best for the company or just resign if they cant the blame should definitely not be on the talented people who actually make those great htc products

it and not make multiple flagship devices in a period of  months look at sensation one x one x butterfly butterly s people are confused as htc doesnt really have a true htc flagship name like galaxy s lumia and xperia theres really not much to remember about htc but the fact that they make too many flagship phones in a short period of time they need to change their marketing strategy have more supplies in stock and create a true flagship name posted on  may    reply  roldefol posts  member since  jan  i dont buy the too many flagships argument whats the difference between htc marketing both the one and butterfly and samsung marketing both the galaxy s and note samsung uniting everything they sell under the galaxy name i think that dilutes the brand and the one x to one x was a midyear refresh that kept the phone competitive i dont see it as a bad thing now if they start selling a    and flagship then maybe image with you posted on  may    reply  jasonk posts  member since  mar  well if htc sells too many flagship phones people who are willing to upgrade feels like they need to chose a different phone brand for example people who currently owns a galaxy s or s it would make sense for them to upgrade to an s or an s if they had great user experience thinking the next one will be much better in htcs situation when people are upgrading from sensation butterfly or one x they might get confused whether they will get the same user experience or not when upgrading to a phone with a different name htc one htc x butterfly s in short some people have loyalty not just on the brand itself but on the particular flagship name as well same thing as liking the sports basketball but theres one team that you like the most go boston celtics posted on  may    in response to  in response to  hide reply  roldefol posts  member since  jan  that ill agree with htc took too long to come up with the unified brand name one last year was a good first step releasing the one s and one x but they were still stuck with carrier exclusivity and verizon and sprint still demanded their own customized droid and evo versions this is similar to where samsung was with the galaxy s by the following year samsung had enough clout to get the s released as a unified brand this year htc finally has the flagship one on  of the big  carriers and on numerous international carriers i dont know that butterfly or droid dna is a great readily identifiable brand name for htc to use but if they release a followup this year under the same name theyre at least minimizing their marques posted on
