maturity for variable and floating rate securities by looking to a portfolios interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates the wam measure effectively captures a funds exposure to

maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions   tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the portfolios blended index added october   as this is a

history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the morningstar rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics ratings may vary by share class ratings andor rankings may be based in part on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by janus henderson methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the ratingranking when an expense waiver is in effect it may have a material effect on the total return or yield and therefore the ranking andor rating for the period the morningstar equity style box™ reveals a funds investment strategy for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth the morningstar fixedincome style box™ reveals a funds investment style as of the date noted for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for a list of all nrsros please visit httpswwwsecgovocrratingagencyhtml additionally morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies if two rating organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the lower rating if three or more organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the median rating and in cases where there are more than two organizationagency ratings and a median rating does not exist fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings please note morningstar inc is not itself a nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund a nrsro or rating agency ratings can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause

growthmid valuemid blendmid growthsmall valuesmall blendsmall growth equity style box  important morningstar information the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the morningstar rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics ratings may vary by share class ratings andor rankings may be based in part on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by janus henderson methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the ratingranking when an expense waiver is in effect it may have a material effect on the total return or yield and therefore the ranking andor rating for the period the morningstar equity style box™ reveals a funds investment strategy for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth the morningstar fixedincome style box™ reveals a funds investment style as of the date noted for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for a list of all nrsros please visit httpswwwsecgovocrratingagencyhtml additionally morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies if two rating organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the lower rating if three or more organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the median rating and in cases where there are more than two organizationagency ratings and a median rating does not exist fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings please note morningstar inc is not itself a nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund a nrsro or rating agency ratings can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected

depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities in addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts the fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful geographic focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries adverse economic political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the funds investment performance management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer sector focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets ie over  in one market sector or group of related industries in this event the funds performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that the fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries small and midcapitalization companies risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market value investing style risk a value investing style subjects the fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market as of  iemcx nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually
