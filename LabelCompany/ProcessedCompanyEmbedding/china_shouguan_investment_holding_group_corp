operations through bsl our operating company and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities vies in shandong province in the peoples republic of china prc mr feize zhang our chairman and ceo mr jingfenglv our cto and mr jianxi yang a director of yantaijinguan investment limited founded ssic in december  and later in early  established ssics subsidiaries jinguan and xinguan these executive officers and managers are experts in china who specialize in mining technologies mining resources management and financial and strategic management our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine projects in shandong province of the prc these potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies we plan to reengineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies capital injection and effective management these advanced exploration and mining technologies include mining data collection and analysis identification of ore locations and running trends of veins design of exploration and mining plans onsite mine construction planning formulation and customization of mining methodologies introduction of modern exploration and mining technologies supervision of subcontracting staff and provision of technical supports in relation to production management mine ventilation water discharge system upgrade quality assurance safety control etc the underground mining works like digging tunnels and wells and the underground transport of ore extracts will all be outsourced to third party subcontractors our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit potential conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects leasing the suitable mining sites and facilities and managing the mineral exploration operations on these selected sites with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations prove to be satisfactory based on the review criteria set by our experienced management to date we have leased the dayuan mine so far we do not have any plan to acquire the dayuan mine in near future we tend to focus our business on the exploratory work of these mines in addition we provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and geological analysis to our clients under the specific requirements of the secs industry guide a i we are deemed as an exploration company principally engaging in gold mine exploration and exportation activities given our mines are without known reserves raw rocks containing gold mineral are dug from the gold mines that are owned or leased by us and are converted to gold concentrate through a number of physical processes revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates the principal raw material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold at that time the selling prices are determined from two factors the amount of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale the amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed between the company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the shanghai gold exchange httpwwwsgesh an entity governed by the prc government in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations the company decides to focus more on mine exploration on the consulting side revenues are derived on a projectbyproject basis and payment is collected as we complete our services as outlined in the scope of each individual project in the coming years we expect there will be more projects on exploratory consulting services we target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the prc and managing them these projects will be executed by bsl and its subsidiaries vies or related companies in china cunliji gold mine was the first project commenced in may  to ensure all mines are legally and properly operated all target gold mines are required to have full sets of governmentapproved licenses before effecting commencement of any business operations there is a limited supply of desirable gold mines in the prc and we face strong competition for gold mining rights from other gold mining companies most of which have greater financial resources than we have so we may not be able to acquire any attractive gold mining rights we find on acceptable terms mining rights are amortized based on actual units of production over estimated proven and or probable reserves of the mines subject to impairment we intend to carefully review the mineral exploration plans and the reserve levels of our mines periodically accordingly any material change in mineral exploration s may have a negative impact on our operating results our mineral exploration activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards typical in the mining industry including � environmental hazards � industrial accidents � unusual or unexpected geologic formations � explosive rock failures and � flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions any such risks could result in � damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities � personal injury or death � environmental damage � delays in mining � monetary losses and � legal liability in addition during the course of mineral exploration activities we use dangerous materials we have established stringent rules relating to the storage handling and use of such dangerous materials however accidents could still occur should we be held liable for any such accident we may be subject to penalties and possible criminal proceedings may be brought against our company bsl its subsidiaries andor vies or any of the employees we emphasize environmental protection in our operations and related activities and a significant financial commitment has been made towards the construction of environmental protection facilities and the establishment of a sound environmental protection management and monitoring system we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations of the prc government but any changes to these regulations may increase our operating costs which could adversely affect our results of operations we are also subject to numerous prc rules and regulations governing the mining industry which are disclosed in detail in the description of business section of this report our inability to comply with any of these current or future rules andor regulations could severely impact our operations and financial condition in addition we provide mining management consulting services to third party clients as an additional source of revenue we only provide mining consulting services to mine owners we do not own rent or participate in the mine operations of these clients

shouguan mining corporation shouguan we and the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on may   we are a holding company that conducts business operations through bsl our operating company and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities vies in shandong province in the peoples republic of china prc mr feize zhang our chairman and ceo mr jingfenglv our cto and mr jianxi yang a director of yantaijinguan investment limited founded ssic in december  and later in early  established ssics subsidiaries jinguan and xinguan these executive officers and managers are experts in china who specialize in mining technologies mining resources management and financial and strategic management our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine projects in shandong province of the prc these potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies we plan to reengineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies capital injection and effective management these advanced exploration and mining technologies include mining data collection and analysis identification of ore locations and running trends of veins design of exploration and mining plans onsite mine construction planning formulation and customization of mining methodologies introduction of modern exploration and mining technologies supervision of subcontracting staff and provision of technical supports in relation to production management mine ventilation water discharge system upgrade quality assurance safety control etc the underground mining works   like digging tunnels and wells and the underground transport of ore extracts will all be outsourced to third party subcontractors our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit potential conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects leasing the suitable mining sites and facilities and managing the mineral exploration operations on these selected sites with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations prove to be satisfactory based on the review criteria set by our experienced management to date we have leased the dayuan mine so far we do not have any plan to acquire the dayuan mine in near future we tend to focus our business on the exploratory work of these mines in addition we provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and geological analysis to our clients under the specific requirements of the secs industry guide a i we are deemed as an exploration company principally engaging in gold mine exploration and exportation activities given our mines are without known reserves raw rocks containing gold mineral are dug from the gold mines that are owned or leased by us and are converted to gold concentrate through a number of physical processes revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates the principal raw material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold at that time the selling prices are determined from two factors the amount of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale the amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed between the company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the shanghai gold exchange httpwwwsgesh an entity governed by the prc government in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations the company decides to focus more on mine exploration on the consulting side revenues are derived on a projectbyproject basis and payment is collected as we complete our services as outlined in the scope of each individual project in the coming years we expect there will be more projects on exploratory consulting services we target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the prc and managing them these projects will be executed by bsl and its subsidiaries vies or related companies in china cunliji gold mine was the first project commenced in may  to ensure all mines are legally and properly operated all target gold mines are required to have full sets of governmentapproved licenses before effecting commencement of any business operations there is a limited supply of desirable gold mines in the prc and we face strong competition for gold mining rights from other gold mining companies most of which have greater financial resources than we have so we may not be able to acquire any attractive gold mining rights we find on acceptable terms mining rights are amortized based on actual units of production over estimated proven and or probable reserves of the mines subject to impairment we intend to carefully review the mineral exploration plans and the reserve levels of our mines periodically accordingly any material change in mineral exploration s may have a negative impact on our operating results   our mineral exploration activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards typical in the mining industry including · environmental hazards · industrial accidents · unusual or unexpected geologic formations · explosive rock failures and · flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions any such risks could result in · damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities · personal injury or death · environmental damage · delays in mining · monetary losses and · legal liability in addition during the course of mineral exploration activities we use dangerous materials we have established stringent rules relating to the storage handling and use of such dangerous materials however accidents could still occur should we be held liable for any such accident we may be subject to penalties and possible criminal proceedings may be brought against our company bsl its subsidiaries andor vies or any of the employees we emphasize environmental protection in our operations and related activities and a significant financial commitment has been made towards the construction of environmental protection facilities and the establishment of a sound environmental protection management and monitoring system we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations of the prc government but any changes to these regulations may increase our operating costs which could adversely affect our results of operations we are also subject to numerous prc rules and regulations governing the mining industry which are disclosed in detail in the description of business section of this report our inability to comply with any of these current or future rules andor regulations could severely impact our operations and financial condition in addition we provide mining management consulting services to third party clients as an additional source of revenue we only provide mining consulting services to mine owners we do not own rent or participate in the mine operations of these clients instead we utilize the described expertise of our management team to help clients assess their mine conditions and provide technical advice guidance and suggestions to further improve management and operations of their mines based on our managements experience current operations on may   we through our vie yantaijinguan investment co ltd jinguan entered into a lease agreement with longkoudayuan gold mining co ltd an unrelated

operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap in connection with the preparation of consolidated financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures the assumptions estimates and judgments included within these estimates are based on historical experience current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared on a regular basis the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments are reviewed to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods significant estimates and assumptions are used for but are not limited to  inventory costs and reserves  asset impairments  and depreciable lives of assets future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty and accordingly accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur   as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes we evaluate and update these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist us with these evaluations actual results could differ from the estimates that have been used significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results as they require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain basis of consolidation the audited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company bsl and its subsidiaries and vies all intercompany balances and transactions between the company bsl and its subsidiaries and vies were eliminated upon consolidation we adopted the accounting standards codification asc topic  variable interest entities asc topic  requires a variable interest entity or vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk

property plant and equipment held and used by the company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of assets to estimated discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets future cash flows are based on estimated quantities of gold and other recoverable metals expected price of gold and other commodity considering current and historical prices price trends and related factors production levels and cash costs of production capital and reclamation costs all based on detailed engineering lifeofmine plans if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets numerous factors including but not limited to such things as unexpected grade changes gold recovery problems shortages of equipment and consumables equipment failures and collapse of pit walls could impact our ability to achieve forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves additionally commodity prices capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment the ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists transfer of title has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenues from the sales of nonrefined gold concentrate whereas it usually takes  days for the production from nonrefined gold concentrate to gold bullion we generally recognize revenues net of valueadded taxes vat at the time the gold bullion is produced and delivered to the customers smelters andor refineries we are generally subject to vat which is levied on the majority of the products at the standard rate of  on the invoiced value of sales however our vie pxil has been granted preferential tax treatment under the chinese tax law of the notice from ministry of finance and state tax bureau in relation to exemption of value added tax on gold production and notice regarding issues on tax policy on gold transaction whereas gold produced and sold by gold mining and smelting enterprises are exempted from vat   interest income is recognized on a time apportionment basis taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable

description china shouguan mining corporation was incorporated in the state of nevada on may   we are a holding company that conducts business operations in shandong province in the people’s republic of china prc on june   we entered into a stock exchange transaction with the shareholders of bei sheng limited “bsl” whereby we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for  of the ownership interest in bsl for the purpose of redomiciling bsl as a nevada corporation in the united states we were founded by a number of business professionals and experts in china who specialize in mining technologies mining resources management and financial and strategic management our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine in shandong province of the prc these potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies we plan to reengineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies capital injection and effective management our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit potential conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects leasing the suitable mining sites and facilities and managing the mining operations on these selected sites with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations prove to be satisfactory based on the review criteria set by our experienced management in addition we also provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and analysis to our clients on a projectbyproject basis revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates the principal raw material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold the mineral exploratory activities of the cunliji mine are outsourced to chongqing yitong mine construction engineering co ltd “cymc” an independent thirdparty subcontractor and we only take possession of the gold concentrates when they are sold to smelters at that time the selling prices are determined from two factors the amount of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale the amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed upon between the company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the shanghai gold exchange httpwwwsgesh an entity governed by the prc government on the consulting side revenues are derived on a projectbyproject basis and payment is collected as we complete our service as outlined in the scope of each individual project in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations the company decides to focus more on mine exploration we target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the prc and managing them these projects will be executed by bsl and its vies cunliji gold mine was the first project commenced in may  to ensure all mines are legally and properly operated all target gold mines are required to have full sets of governmentapproved licenses before effecting commencement
