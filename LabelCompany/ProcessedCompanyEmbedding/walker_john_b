single malt whiskies—notably his own walkers kilmarnock in  he launched johnnie walkers first commercial blend and called it old highland whisky he then made the astute move of engaging ships captains as his agents to carry his whisky wherever ships could sail before long his unique blend was available around the globe alexander walker introduced the iconic square bottle in  this meant more bottles fitting the same space and resulted in fewer broken bottles the other identifying characteristic of the johnnie walker bottle is the label which is applied at an angle of  degrees and allows text to be made larger and more visible from  to  johns grandsons george and alexander ii expanded the line and introduced the colour names in  when james stevenson was the managing director the rebranding was finalised and in  special old highland whisky was renamed johnnie walker red label while the extra special old highland whisky was renamed johnnie walker black label in addition the slogan born
