changing risk landscape by willis towers watson september   managing risk is an increasingly challenging task in a world susceptible both to old hazards such as extreme weather and to emerging threats like cyberattacks in this interview the ceo of risk advisor and insurance broker willis group dominic casserley discusses opportunities to mitigate emerging risks build more resilient companies and digitize the insurance process this interview was conducted by mckinsey’s rik kirkland and an extended and edited transcript of casserley’s remarks follows the risk landscape we see a number of trends that really underpin growth for us one is that in many parts of the world businesses are fundamentally underinsured and that’s what we’re really involved in risk advisory and insurance brokerage for businesses if you take the united states where insurance premiums in the space we’re talking about are about  percent of gdp and in china they’re just over  percent that’s indicative of the fact that there is a long way to go there’s a long way to go not only in building up more resilient companies which have more insurance but actually in the middle of that conducting advisory and brokerage activities to help them navigate a complex world that’s one growth opportunity for us a second is in the world of healthcare we provide a lot of advice and support to companies in building their healthcare programs our role in advising companies is very important as their populations have higher and higher healthcare aspirations the third growth opportunity for us on a macrolevel is emerging new risks the one everyone reads about of course is cyber it’s an area that ten years ago hardly anyone talked about but it is now a major issue for companies countries cities to think through and thinking through lossprevention and resilience to loss from cyberattacks and cyber issues and datamanagement issues is a major topic developing new products when you’re thinking about developing new products in new risk areas you’re obviously struggling with data i’ll give you two examples in the cyber area the risk is still evolving and the best ways of managing that risk are evolving i would say that is very early this is a very young event another new risk area one that is getting much more focus is the impact of extreme weather climate change and there actually is data some of it’s controversial but there is data so you can start to model the sorts of risks that people could be facing particularly if they have a diversified portfolio for example for someone on the east coast of the united states there is a lot of modeling of the types of risks they may face which does enable you to start to develop products and ways of risk mitigation that companies can adopt but underpinning all of this is how stable is the risk and is there data innovating across the business there is some evidence that the whole insurance chain in bb insurance could be starting to enter the disintermediation process that we saw in banking where in the ’s ’s ’s and early s we saw a decline in the relative amount of volume that was going through the traditional banking markets because direct capitalmarket disintermediation of that process increased there’s some evidence that we may be in the early stages of that happening in the insurance field in the bbinsurance field that would be of great interest to us and we’re looking at that very very carefully the second element of innovation is obviously responding to new risks we’re working very hard to help businesses figure out how they should think about cyberrisk we’re spending a lot of time investing in the weather outlook and what implications that has for our clients and developing new products new capabilities for companies countries and cities to think about resilience a third area of innovation for us relating to our own business is digitization it’s crucial to us for two reasons one it’s about providing better products through data management our industry is full of data it isn’t full of a lot of information so how do we turn that data into usable information that can produce better products for our clients it’s also about reducing our costs and reducing the costs of the whole business system—not just willis’s role in it but actually the whole flow thinking about digitization and how it affects our business—i’ll start at the client side because there’s so much potential data about frankly the loss history of groups of clients we now have a portfolio of  clients who are broadly in the same category and we can show you that such a diversified portfolio produces over time this sort of loss history and we have the data to underpin that you then actually have a potential portfolio of risk that can be used and marketed to a much broader set of investors—insurance companies but also potentially other investors that creates potentially a better product and better pricing for our clients when we think about digitization applied to us there’s still a lot of paper in this industry a lot and that’s expensive so all the things we’ve seen in the trading markets or straightthrough processing in theory should be applied in the insurance industry now the insurance industry is more complicated the fundamental issue is that the insurance contract has more variability to it and uniqueness to it than a bond but it isn’t limitless so there are opportunities to digitize that focusing on the future we’re a people business so the way we attract train retain motivate and compensate them are critical issues related to that issue number two is actually all the issues around the sense of purpose of the company why do we exist values and having that as a common bond which enables us to be very mission driven and connected as an organization is very important the third issue is the use of technology digitization issues to serve our clients and also frankly to make us more effective and efficient—that’s critical but there is a fourth issue which is that like it or not as a ceo you do have to keep an eye on world dynamics we’re a global company and if you think you can operate independently of what’s going on in the world it’s just not realistic so you do have to make either longterm or shortterm resourceallocation shifts based upon the realities of what’s going on in the world   this video and the accompanying transcript originally appeared on the mckinsey  company website september   dominic casserley is the ceo of willis group rik kirkland is the senior
