fatigue when investors rely on any particular model all the timeand cape is often that modelfatigue inevitably sets in we believe that a better approach for meeting future spending needs is to blend portfolios based on different models of return expectations underweight fanmag chillax if it seems everyones portfolios—except yours—are overweight the fanmag stocks chillax were here to remind you not to forget the long–term value proposition of contra–trading trimming pricey stocks and rebalancing into unloved stocks exactly what the rafi strategies are designed to do i was blind but now i see bubbles in academe academia is just as susceptible to bubbles in theories insights and models as is the financial and investment industry in following market pricing trends cleareyed skepticism and a commitment to the scientific method can help us all avoid the bubbles forming in the first place presidential politics and stock returns is the relation real or spurious an analysis of five international stock markets indicates that published findings of a correlation between us stock returns and the political party in the white house are spurious highlighting the importance of caution in interpreting historical investment data public policy profits and populism the trump bump reveals market expectations of continuing public policies prioritizing stability inhibiting creative destruction depressing yields and wage growth and inflating a profits bubble if instead the administration delivers reforms that allow creative destruction invigorate growth and raise returns to capital and wages then the lofty profits of corporate incumbents will be at risk which rafi index strategy is right for you rafi and rafi dynamic multifactor have different risk and return characteristics the choice between the two strategies should be determined by an investor’s objectives and their institutional governance mechanism john west at the morningstar conference april   john west explains why using fundamental factors as a weighting and rebalancing anchor—not stock price—can help investors avoid the return drag associated with market capitalization why factor tilts are not smart “smart beta” our analysis of three firstgeneration smart beta strategies shows factorreplicated portfolios are ineffective substitutes for their smart beta counterparts exhibiting poorer performance high turnover and low capacity video why factor tilts are not smart “smart beta” we challenge the common view that “smart beta” strategies and factor tilts are the same in fact factorreplicated portfolios are poor substitutes for their smart beta counterparts performance is poor turnover is high and capacity is terrible why implementation details matter—both for performance and for trading costs the incredible shrinking factor return managers who favor high factor loadings on market beta value or momentum generally do not derive nearly as much incremental return as theoretical factor return histories would suggest and the culprit appears to be the realworld costs of implementation alice in factorland and the incredible shrinking factor return research by rob arnott vitali kalesnik and lillian wu shows that factortilt strategies suffer from substantial return slippage vs factor long–short paper portfolios due to the realworld costs of implementation multifactor rafi multifactor rafi multifactor is a smart beta equity strategy that offers diversified factor exposures through allocations to value low volatility quality momentum and size a smoother path to outperformance with multifactor smart beta investing you can outperform the market with substantially lower relative risk by diversifying across simple smart beta strategies based on a half dozen robust factors dynamically rebalancing these factorbased smart betas significantly improves returns take the  challenge or the “lloyd christmas” lesson most retirement calculators and pension plans target a return after inflation of  mainstream asset classes producing rockbottom yields will be hard pressed to deliver it’s time to get real take the  challenge use our portfolio builder—and our expected returns—to calculate the probability of your portfolio earning a  real return  graham  dodd scroll award of excellence will your factor deliver an examination of factor robustness and implementation costs not every factor profits investors when implemented through a passive strategy size and quality show weak robustness and liquiditydemanding factors such as illiquidity and momentum are associated with high trading costs investors may be better off accessing these factors through active management rather than indexation published in the financial analysts journal by

dividends than growth stocks growth stocks on the other hand typically enjoy faster dividend growth what most investors miss is that a portfolio of value stocks generates faster growth in dividends than a portfolio of growth stocks published in the journal of portfolio management by rob arnott and denis chaves smart beta forecasting smart beta and factors history is worse than useless past is not prologue with the proliferation of smart beta and factor strategies investors should be vigilant to the pitfalls of data mining and performance chasing relative valuations can predict the longterm

principal–agent relationship charting the journey in smart beta historical factor returns—net of changes in valuation levels—are much lower than recent performance suggests in fact many of the most popular new factors some  at last count have succeeded solely because they have become more expensive this trend matters to investors because rising valuation levels inflate past performance reduce potential future performance and amplify the risk of mean reversion to historical valuations rethinking conventional wisdom why not a value bias not all longterm sources of excess return are treated
