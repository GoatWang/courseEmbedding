investment analysis calculator led brightness led checklist technical information quality and testing ex norms subpages led and lifetime one of the benefits of the led is its long lifetime because they have no movable parts or filaments that may break leds can have long lifetime the light output from all light sources led halogen metal halide and fluorescent decreases over time the amount of light from the light source at a specific time in the future is referred to as the lamp lumen maintenance factor or llmf the lifetime of a led module is defined as the time it takes until its light output or lumen maintenance reaches  of the initial output this is also called l in other words the module does not die instantly as many conventional light sources do it slowly dims down lighting planners take this effect into account when they dimension the lighting installation as they want the light level to reach a minimum lux value at the end of the lifetime they overdimension the luminaire installation often by using more luminaires therefore the lux value in the beginning of the operating life of the lighting installation is higher than what it is at the end the luminaire industry has standardised led lifetime to l  minimum  hours which corresponds to an llmf of  as long as the lifetime of the lighting installation is set to the same amount of hoursthe actual lifetime of a led luminaire is important for cost savingsfor some of our products the lumen degradation is better than the industry standard after  hours of life not only  of the life remains but  or even more the llmf is then raised to  or above and the lighting designer does not need to overdimension the lighting installation as much with this upgrade up to  of the luminaires may be left out depending on the ceiling type that means lower installation costs and a lower energy bill at the same time the lux levels are always meeting the lighting norm requirements in our datasheets this is shown as lx    hours at  deg ambient temperature ta  new standards on led lifetimenew international standards on how lifetime should be declared on led luminaires have now been published the standards are iec  ledmodules for general lighting – performance requirements and iec  particular requirements for led luminaireswhat do the standards sayiec  states both test method and minimum required time for testing led lifetimes the minimum test time is  hours where the luminous flux is recorded every  hours these values are extrapolated using a method stated in ies tmwhat’s newthe life time for the led module and the driver should be declared separately if the life time for the driver is shorter than that of the module a driver replacement may be necessary before the luminaire’s lifecycle is completed this means that there cannot be a single figure declaring the total luminaire life time we do not document driver lifetimeslife time for led modulesthe lifetime of a led module inside a luminaire is related to the luminous flux depreciation at a given ambient temperature l l or l indicates how many lumens in percentage related to the initial lumens that remains after endoflife the lvalue may be explained b and cvalues glamox normally states two lifetimeslifetime l at maximum ta this value is normally minimum  hourlifetime l at ta this lifetime depends on the module’s temperature conditionb valuethe failure fraction for by expresses only the gradual light output degradation as a percentage y of a number of led modules of the same type that at their rated life designates the percentage fraction of failures the value b indicates that the declared lvalue will be achieved by minimum   of the led modules and that the remaining  may have a lower lumen value the value b means that minimum   of the led modules will meet the declared lvalue and only  will have a lower flux level a b value is therefore more conservative than b in practical terms it means that b is reached at an earlier stage in the life time on a set of led modules compared to b c valuethe failure fraction for cy expresses only the abrupt light output degradation as a percentage y of a number of led modules of the same type that at their rated life designates the percentage fraction of failures a catastrophic failure is when the led module does not emit any light glamox does not publish c values for our led products the figure shows the two factors that affect led luminaire lifetime – gradual degradation of the lumen output or abrupt failure of the luminaire source zveif valuethe f value depicts the combined failure fraction this is the combination of both gradual b and total failures cdriver lifetimethe led driver can be compared to other electronic components such as hfballasts for t lamps the expected life time depends on the design itself the used components and the temperature of these components glamox only uses drivers from quality suppliers the drivers are marked with a reference temperature point tc where the stated temperature never should be exceeded often the maximum ambient temperature ta of the luminaire relates to the maximum value on the tcpoint at this ta we declare a lifetime of h with an estimated failure rate of  during this timewhy is the lvalue so importantthe lvalue is directly related to the maintenance factor mf used when making a light calculation mf includes the following parameters mfllmf x lsf x lmf x rsmf llmf  lamp lumen maintenance factor lsf  lamp survival factor the lsf factor can be ignored set to  if the luminaires are replaced immediately after failure lmf  luminaire maintenance factor depends on type of luminaire how clean is the environment and finally the cleaning interval of the luminaire normal values for interior use are between – for clean environments rsmf  room surface maintenance factor depends on reflectance factors in the room how clean is the environment and finally the cleaning interval of the room normal values for interior use are between – for clean environments llmf is basically the same as the lvalue l corresponds to a llmf of  in order to find the correct l value you must first define the correct required lifetime and the correct required ambient temperature ta glamox states the lvalue after  h at ta  deg since the llmf is based on average values it is stated as b example lx b lmf and rsmf values are defined in cie  and most pc based light calculation programs have tables that help you chose the correct valueexample recessed led luminaire used in an office landscape this luminaire has a lifetime of l   hours at ta  degrees environment clean cleaning interval twice a year reflection factors   mf  llmf x lsf x lmf x rsmf    example recessed led downlight used in a corridor this luminaire has a lifetime of l   hours at ta  degrees environment clean cleaning interval twice a year reflection factors   mf  llmf x lsf x lmf x rsmf      for products designed for enclosed installation the lifetime will not exceed the lifetime at max ta for example a downlight may have a lifetime of l   hours at  deg and   hours at  deg max ta an enclosed installation would call for a lifetime of   hours maintenancethe figures below show lamp lumen maintenance factor llmf in  over time k   h and number of light source shifts up to  hours for various
