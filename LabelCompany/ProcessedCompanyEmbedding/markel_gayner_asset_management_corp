samuel a markel he had two sets of twin brothers that join him in the venture currently the company underwrites customized insurance products the insurance segments include markel wholesale global insurance markel specialty global reinsurance and markel international in  markel nearly doubled the size of its insurance operations by acquiring alterra markel insurance business had a combined ratio of  percent including  points of underwriting loss from alterra in  the industry average was  percent for  a combined ratio of less than  percent indicates an underwriting profit the combined ratio is of big importance to markel if it is below  the float essentially becomes an interest free loan to invest with the subsidiary markel ventures makes strategic investments in companies outside of the insurance marketplace it currently includes  different businesses in the sectors of manufacturing consumer healthcare business services and financial services these companies are all private the company currently has a  billion insurance float according to gurufocus interview with gayner in  markel does not invest as much of its float into equities as berkshire hathaway does tom gayner trades portfolio gave the following comment berkshire has a much bigger balance sheet than markel and a much bigger base of equity compared to its insurance liabilities than we do as such they can allocate more of the investment portfolio towards equities over time if we continue to grow and build up our equity capital we should be able to move in the same direction as berkshire top  holdings company value thousands berkshire hathaway brka brkb  carmax kmx  diageo deo  walgreen company wag  brookfield asset management bam  berkshire hathaway holding includes both a and b shares conclusion of the guru companies markel seems to be the most similar to berkshire hathaway in structure markel has a market cap of only  billion and has much more room to grow than berkshire with a market cap of  billion since markels ipo in  it has grown its book value at a faster rate than berkshire berkshire said the following in its most recent k because of the large size of our capital base shareholders equity of approximately  billion as of december   our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at a rate even close to its past rate while markel book value per share is increasing at a high rate the stock is still trading at a  percent discount to berkshire hathaways pricetobook value historically markel has traded at a median pb of  over the past  years its median pb has been slightly higher than  the pb is currently at  the stock would be valued at  if it traded at it year median pb the stock closed at  today april   therefore the stock is undervalued by
