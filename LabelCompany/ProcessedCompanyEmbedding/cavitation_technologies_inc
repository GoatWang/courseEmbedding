hydrodynamic flow trough cavitation a process for the extraction of carbohydrates from biomass using hydrodynamic cavitation and a process for converting the carbohydrates into bioalcohol using hydrodynamic cavitation the present invention uses hydrodynamic cavitation for processing heterogeneous and homogeneous liquid systems the cavitation facilitates synthesis of intermediate and final products in the overall production of biofuels alcoholic biofuels or bioalcohol such as methanol ethanol butanol propanol etc may be derived from biological materials ie biomass the biomass may include corn cob corn stover cotton stalk wheat straw rice straw sugarcane bagasse switchgrass poplar wood sorghum straw andor water hyacinthcts patented  nano cavitation  reactor is highly versatile for the extraction of carbohydrates from lignocellulosic biomass or the biomass pretreatment which is an important and costintensive step in the synthesis of alcoholic biofuels especially through the fermentation or biochemical route hydrodynamic cavitation is useful in the pretreatment of biomass prior to synthesis of biofuels – primarily through fermentation such processing enhances the release of carbohydrates or sugars from biomass prior to fermentation of hydrolyzate comprising of hexose and pentose sugarsa large portion of the carbohydrates are extracted from the biomass by an acid or alkali hydrolysis process which process is aided by the hydrodynamic cavitation  strong microturbulence generated by hydrodynamic cavitation helps in the faster and more efficient transport of sugar moieties out of the biomass matrix into the solution the nano cavitation device is particularly efficient at mixing the biomass with reagents and generating in this mixture the transient cavitation features followed by separation of the reaction mixture comprised of the extracted carbohydrates residual initial reagents remaining biomass and other byproducts constant refreshing of the water in the biomass matrix enhances the rate of hydrolysis due to the fresh supply of hydrolyzing ions inside the biomass matrix and also dissolution of sugar and carbohydrate molecules leading to enhanced yield the shock waves generated by microbubbles also help in expanding or swelling of biomass that increases the net voidage of the matrix allowing for smoother flow of liquid medium or water through the matrix these pretreatments are applied prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in the biomass the pretreatment has a twofold purpose  to break down the shield formed by lignin and emicellulose which results in better andhigher accessibility of enzymes to the cellulose during enzyme hydrolysis and  to reduce the degree of polymerization of cellulose with disruption of crystalline structure which enhances the yield of the enzymatic hydrolysis the lignocellulosic biomass is typically in the form of agro or forest residue biomass pretreatment is perhaps the most cost intensive step in overall biofuels synthesis obviously any advancement of the pretreatment technology would have a significant impact on the economics of biofuels process a process for extracting carbohydrates from biomass comprising the steps of preparing the biomass for extraction of carbohydrates forming a first biomass solution comprising the prepared biomass water and acid or an alkali subjecting the first biomass solution to a first nano cavitation treatment wherein acid or alkali hydrolysis of the biomass occurs filtering the first biomass solution into a first filtrate and an intermediate biomass wherein the first filtrate contains extracted carbohydrates creating a second biomass solution comprising the intermediate biomass water and an enzyme source exposing the second biomass solution to a second hydrodynamic cavitation treatment wherein enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass occurs filtering the second biomass solution into a second filtrate and a filtered biomass wherein the second filtrate contains extracted carbohydrates fermenting the second filtrate to create a bioalcohol and separating the bioalcohol by distillation or similar process the first and second filtrates may be combined and fermented in a single step  nano cavitation treatment wherein acid or alkali hydrolysis of the biomass occurs a second hydrodynamic cavitation treatment wherein enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass occurs test after cavitation of corn slurry enzyme was added to the samples and a short   hour hydrolysis followed the treated samples were found to yield   times more reducing sugar compared to the control untreated samples the study suggests that cti nano cavitation systems enhances enzymatic hydrolysis yield reduces particle size of corn slurry and could be a potential effective pretreatment for corn slurry we have done extensive study with cavitation in this particular field and seen substantial improvement up to  increase in yield  related links core

will have biodiesel products sales of  million in the next  months with cumulative profits of  million over the next  years the market continues to increase dramatically for biodiesel and the us is positioned to become the largest biodiesel market with  world market share by  and us demand to grow to  billion gallons of biodiesel per year by  the new us administrations focus on green technology energy independence and environmental concern along with multiple government incentive programs and mandates should only increase the current trend cvat views its technology as essential to achieving national biodiesel policy modification of crude oil cvat filed a patent for the rapid modification and enhancement of crude oil at the end of  by applying its cavitation technology to oil refining the company is able to increase the efficiency of refining crude petroleum to gasoline kerosene diesel jet fuel and other valuable hydrocarbonbased products the developed cavitation reactor generator can be used as a feed injectormixer and can be easily coupled to a fluid catalytic cracking unit fccu or any other refining facility to maximize the refinerys profitability with our system crude oil has been converted into many useful products one barrel of crude oil gives the following percent yield gasoline  fuel oil  jet fuel  petrochemicals  coke  asphalt and road oil  liquefied gases  lubricants  kerosene  and waxes  cavitated oil increases the output of light fractions at lower temperatures cavitation heats crude oil disrupts its matrix and improves api gravity and viscosity the process breaks down hydrocarbons and facilitates their fragmentation which results in creation of more valuable byproducts there are several potential benefits of using cavitation on crude oil such as but not limited to reducing energy consumption by a minimum of  facilitating cracking of hydrocarbons increases gasolinediesel yield by reducing sulfur content raising the octane number in the straight run benzene and diesel fractions and facilitating separation of water from the petroleum for instance in cvat trials oil cavitation in the absence of hydrogen gas has increased the brnumber astm d by  roman gordon ceo of cvat said in a recent press release we look forward to productive collaboration with a number of the oil mining and refining companies oil refining is a multibillion dollar industry and we are very excited to become part of it we are certain that our systems will increase profitability by cutting refining costs saving energy and increasing efficiencies during our testing more diesel and gasoline was produced from the same barrel of crude oil using our technology the company is in discussion with several householdname oil companies on the possible use of cvat technology for the modification of crude oil other applications many other applications of cvat cavitator technology are being explored in the chemical industry cvat cavitators can be used to process silicones resins waxes textile fibers lubricants and much more multiple streams of raw materials can be fed into a cvat cavitator reactor and create instant emulsions with small particle sizes and tight distributions many powders such as fumed silicas zinc oxides and such can be dispersed with amazing results likewise in the personal care industry cvat cavitation systems can be used to process
