creative medical technology holdings inc otcqbcelz a clinical stage stem cell company announced today filing of a patent application covering the use of its amniostem universal donor stem cell product as a treatment of radiation toxicity  the company plans to leverage the ability of its amniotic fluid based stem cell product to induce a process termed neurogenesis in which specific areas of the brain are activated to repair damaged tissue  the amniostem product is derived from amniotic fluid and possesses advantages of fetal stem cells without harming the fetus having seen firsthand in my brain cancer patients the horrific effects of posttreatment radiation toxicity i am excited about the prospect of having something to offer that potentially could reduce cognitive impairment in this group of patients said santosh kesari md phd fana faan scientific advisory board member to creative medical technology holdings inc and patent coauthor  dr kesari is chair and professor department of
