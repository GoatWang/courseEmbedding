the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements  this standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position

recognize in the financial statements  as a result of the implementation of this standard the company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by fasb asc      deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences  temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   at march   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that may be offset against future taxable income through  no tax benefits have been reported in the financial statements because the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount   due to the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations therefore net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in the future        table of contents   vican resources inc notes to the

losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit at march   of  has negative working capital and negative cash flows from operations all of which raise substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the company believes these conditions have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small companies such risks include but are not limited to the ability to i generate revenues and sales of its products and services at levels sufficient to cover its costs and provide a return for investors ii attract additional capital in order to finance

cash and cash equivalents since inception the company has financed its operations through a combination of short and longterm loans and through the private placement of its common stock   the company has sustained significant net losses which have resulted in a total stockholders’ deficit at march   of  and is currently experiencing a substantial shortfall in operating capital which raises doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company anticipates a net loss for the year ending december   and with the expected cash requirements for the coming months without additional cash inflows from an increase in revenues combined with continued costcutting or a receipt of cash from capital investment there is substantial doubt as to the company’s ability to continue operations   we may seek to secure additional debt or equity capital to finance substantial business development initiatives there is presently no agreement in place with any source of financing for the company and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise any additional funds or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially dilutive to current shareholders lack of additional funds will materially affect the company and its business and may cause the company to cease operations
