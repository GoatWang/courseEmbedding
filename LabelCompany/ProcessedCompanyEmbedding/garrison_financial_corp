approach of asset allocation security selection and portfolio construction which is consistent with longterm wealth building inflation protection and the realization of client goals we maintain a longterm market focus that covers an entire market cycle and is generally  to  years in horizon  we do not attempt to “time” the market and we do not trade excessively  we conduct our own investment research inhouse and our portfolios are specifically tailored to meet the needs of each client describe your typical client we serve a wide range of highnetworth individual clients and midmarket institutions throughout the united states  our typical clients include young professional singles or couples persons planning for or in retirement and regional institutional clients such as foundations and endowments  we have focused our efforts on approximately  clients and currently have approximately  million in assets under management can you provide me with some names and telephone numbers of your long term clients due to the confidential nature of our business we would be happy to provide you with several longterm client references after receiving permission from the client how do you get paid by commission amount of assets you manage another method garrison is a fee only investment adviser  our only compensation comes from an annual fee we charge our clients and is based on the amount of assets we manage for each client  we do not charge commissions and we are not paid a fee for selling products like insurance and mutual funds to our clients  we do not receive any initial or ongoing fees from any investment products we purchase on behalf of our clients  we do not provide any services on an hourly basis we believe this feeonly approach puts us and our clients on the same side of the table  when we purchase an investment for your account it’s because we believe that it is in your best interest not because we will be receiving a sales commission although many of our clients’ assets are held in custody at charles schwab  company clients are free to choose the custodian of their choice  we conduct our equity trading at charles schwab and they charge clients a commission for each trade we conduct that is absorbed by the client account  garrison financial does not receive any portion of this commission and we are not compensated in any fashion based on the number of trades we conduct on your behalf most of our fixed income trading is conducted in the overthecounter otc markets using broker relationships going back as much as  years  the securities are traded on a “net” basis meaning there is no stated commission  when these securities are held in your account at charles schwab you are charged a onetime prime brokerage fee for each purchase and sale  in most cases based on our access to the institutional fixed income markets we are able to purchase fixed income securities from our established brokers and pay the prime brokerage fees to schwab at an overall cost that is cheaper than if we had purchased the same fixed income security directly through schwab garrison financial does not receive any portion of this prime brokerage fee and we are not compensated in any fashion based on the number of trades we conduct on your behalf on occasion we will purchase investments mutual funds etf’s etc  for client portfolios in very specialized areas such as international stocks and international bonds to provide additional diversification and when we identify an appropriate investment opportunity  these products have no up front fees but they do incur internal management fees that are reflected in their share prices  the majority of your portfolio will always be invested in individual stocks and bonds that we choose on your behalf based on our internal research and your written investment policy statement we do not receive any portion of these fees from the product issuer as part of our compensation do i have any choices on how to pay you should i pay you by the transaction or a flat fee regardless of how many transactions i have as mentioned earlier we are a feeonly investment adviser  we are not compensated per transaction and we are not compensated based on the number of trades we conduct in your account our fees are billed at an annual rate and are paid quarterly in arrears based on the average market value of your account during the quarter  most clients elect the option to have their fee deducted directly from their account  you will receive a full accounting of the exact fee you are charged and this amount will be thoroughly explained to you in the quarterly correspondence you receive from us we do not charge any upfront fees or termination fees do you make more if i buy this stock or bond or mutual fund rather than another no  if you weren’t making extra money would your recommendation be the same we do not earn commissions on trades in client accounts  the trades we conduct for clients are based on our best professional judgment at the time the securities are purchased or sold  we do not receive any initial or ongoing fees from any investment products we purchase on behalf of our clients are you participating in a sales contest is this purchase really in my best interest or are you trying to win a prize no  every purchase or sale we make on your behalf is based on our best professional judgment at the time  we conduct all our client activity with your best interest in mind you’ve told me what it costs me to buy this stock or bond or mutual fund how much will i receive if i sell it today you will receive the then current market price for any security we sell on your behalf less the custodian’s commission or primebrokerage fee as discussed in question  above where do you send my order to be executed can we get a better price if we send it to another market we send each client equity order either electronically or verbally to the institutional trading desk of charles schwab  company for execution  the trade is then executed on the stock exchange in which the security trades  fixed income trades are conducted in the overthecounter markets otc from various brokers based on the specific availability of the bond in question  every effort is made to obtain best execution on behalf of our clients b  questions about the progress of your investments how frequently do i get statements every time we buy or sell a security in your account you will receive a confirmation from charles schwab or your custodian  charles schwab or the custodian of your choice will also send you a monthly statement detailing your portfolio holdings and activity you will receive a more detailed quarterly statement directly from us including performance and capital gainloss information which has been reconciled by our portfolio accounting staff do i understand what the statement tells me our statements are produced by stateoftheart portfolio accounting software and are very easy to understand  we are always happy to explain any details of the statement that are not clear to you is the return on my investment meeting my expectations and goals through our client education process we are realistic with our clients regarding potential return and potential loss  a detailed accounting of how your investments are performing compared to an appropriate market index is sent to you quarterly  we are always available to review investment performance with you as often as you like and to discuss current market conditions have my goals changed if so are my investments still suitable we recommend to clients that they review with us at least annually any lifechanges or other circumstances that may warrant a change in asset allocation how will my investment manager calculate and report investment performance to me we use stateoftheart portfolio accounting software daily to reconcile your account with us to your custodian  performance is calculated to include realized and unrealized gains and losses dividends and income and other items related to investment performance performance is calculated under industry standard guidelines and is designed to reflect actual investment manager performance and to exclude cash flows into and out of your portfolio performance is compared to appropriate market benchmarks which themselves include

education and knowledge when it comes to managing financial assets but while they may spend countless hours learning about markets securities and associated risks investors often overlook the qualifications of the professionals whom they hire to manage their money if you work with investment advisers they will have access to the personal details of your finances so their credentials should
