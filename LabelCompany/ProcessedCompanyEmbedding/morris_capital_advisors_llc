morris capital advisors   home     about us      fund investors       investment advisory services      how to invest      news     contact us our view   market commentary  valuation is in the eye of the beholder i have noticed a dramatic increase in commentary regarding overextended valuation levels in the stock markets  it is not limited to those “permabears” who seem to make a living finding reasons to convert your investments to cash gold or highly leveraged put option strategies that only they can execute profitably  the topic has been discussed by research analysts at prominent financial institutions and wellregarded market commentators  the question has been posed to me by clients business associates even late night at the bar with my hockey teammates  i haven’t been stopped and asked on the street by strangers but i do wonder if that is next there are a number of good reasons to have this discussion and to have this discussion now  first the strength and duration of the market rally that began late last year has surprised many people  the move has been fueled by a change in investor expectations amid the potential for regulatory and tax reform rather than underlying measurable economic improvement  the rally extended valuation metrics stretched over the last several years as central bankers employed controversial policy measures to influence economic activity and the markets  finally valuations should always matter when investing in shares of operating companies rather than market index proxies   more        quick links                    mutual

increase in commentary regarding overextended valuation levels in the stock markets  it is not limited to those “permabears” who seem to make a living finding reasons to convert your investments to cash gold or highly leveraged put option strategies that only they can execute profitably  the topic has been discussed by research analysts at prominent financial institutions and wellregarded market commentators  the question has been posed to me by clients business associates even late night at the bar with my hockey teammates  i haven’t been stopped and asked on the street by strangers but i do wonder if that is next there are a number of good reasons to have this discussion and to have this discussion now  first the strength and duration of the market rally that began late last year has surprised many people  the move has been fueled by a change in investor expectations amid the potential for regulatory and tax reform rather than underlying measurable economic improvement  the rally extended valuation metrics stretched over the last several years as central bankers employed controversial policy measures to influence economic activity and the markets  finally valuations should always matter when investing in shares of operating companies rather than market index proxies   more        quick links                    mutual funds  manor fund  growth fund  bond fund
