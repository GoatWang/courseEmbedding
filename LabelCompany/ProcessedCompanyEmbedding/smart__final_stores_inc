information presented in accordance with gaap the company uses certain nongaap financial measures namely ebitda and adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and adjusted net income per diluted share to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods we also use these nongaap financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in establishing operational goals we believe that providing these nongaap financial measures to investors as a supplement to gaap financial measures helps investors to i evaluate our operating and financial performance and future prospects ii compare financial results across accounting periods iii better understand the longterm performance of our core business and iv evaluate trends in our business all consistent with how management evaluates such performance and movements the company defines ebitda as net income before depreciation and amortization interest expense and provision for income tax and adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for the items set forth in the table below  the company defines adjusted net income as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the table below the company defines adjusted net income per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding the company defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding use of these nongaap measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies each of these nongaap measures has its limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as reported under gaap the following
