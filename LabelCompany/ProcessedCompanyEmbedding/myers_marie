to the teachers and staff members that have been part of our family for nine years we enrolled our son in aloha angels children center when he was only  years old since then he has grown and matured into an amazing intelligent young man aloha angel director and teachers look at each child as an individual with their own strengths and needs my son has been blessed with awesome teachers who would understand his challenges and handle him with grace what my son has learned at aloha angels as well as the warmth and respect towards others thank you so much for the attention and support that you have given my son over the years as we are sad to say goodbye because our son is going off to middle school i truly recommend aloha angels children center to all my friends and family and to all of you reading this post   team aloha angelsmichelina salon  spamichelle a ratedresponding to alex ri realize that having a autism child is difficult and only you and other parents realizes this but did you forget how long it took you to get patients for this behavior how can you expect a business to understand with a few hours of your childs behavior and get it slandering them is unexcepeabl and unfair for you to take out your fustrations before you slander people step back and think how it was in the beginning for you learning how to deal with this it takes a saint and you are one of them its not easy but not every one knows how to cope with it this place has heart and you are making it out to be a bad place because of your child that has very special needs not everyone knows how to handle am autism child its very difficult and you should be the last person to judge remember you hate people that judge your child at first so what gives you the right to judge someone else so

with my hair color cuts and styles in addition gene provides excellent hair care advice and shows sincere interest in his clients michelina’s has recently expanded adding a boutique and gift items and nail salon these features are a welcome addition in an area still needing many more retail services michelina’s is located at the north end of a strip mall around the corner from the section facing gateway blvd currently a sandwich board on gateway directs clients to the somewhat hidden locationbrink results inclorens a ratedi have worked with the principals and several associates of brinks results since  they have helped us develop our internal executive team as well as mangers in the field and this has allowed us to expand our business dramatically one of the key tools that we have used to make better new hire selections as well as improve the performance of our key people is the pro scan surveys we are much clearer today on what we are looking for from every new hire as well as existing staff i recommend brinks results to any organization that is looking to grow their businesshead gamesdroses ratedi went to this salon on a last minute decision and i was so glad i did my hairstylist was ashley and she was awesome she really knows what she is doing she corrected my brassy orange hair color and made it look so natural and beautiful the cut was very nice too she cut it the way i asked her too without being talked out of it everyone there was very nice and pleasant not once did i feel that the stylist were better than i the prices were just right considering other salon prices i will definitely be going backtrue salongoatwomyn ratedi had an incredible european fi had an incredible european facial with kristinaincredibly relaxing yet did not slack on the extractions and sound skin care the facial also included a hand neck and foot massage total bliss from a complete professional i came to this salon because another business with which i had a groupon unfortunately went out of business and groupon arranged for true salon to honor the groupon with the other business true salon was first class all the way throughout the entire experiencehair by carlosgirlu ratedi would disagree with the bad i would disagree with the bad review given by the client i had a wonderful experience there and carlos had the know of what cut and style i needed his salon was at that time a bit torn up but has gone under a complete revamp his staff was cordial and i would compare him to the type of artist that are only found in nyc or miami the salon looks greatmichelina salon  spapatricia b ratedi was very very pleased with the color and cut i received from mariellis i thought the price was a bit high but i guess you get what you pay for i also liked the gift boutique area they have several rooms with a nice variety of wellpriced jewelry and gift items i will be going back more expensive than my stylist up north but a good job we just redesigned
