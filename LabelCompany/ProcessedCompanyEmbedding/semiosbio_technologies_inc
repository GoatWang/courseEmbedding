effective economical and sustainable pest management and the agricultural sector is facing a sea change enter vancouverbased semiosbio technologies inc which since  has offered semiosnet a pest management system for farming that is devoid of neurotoxins cameraequipped traps that monitor pest activity are placed throughout a field or orchard approximately one for every hectare a central hub then delivers this information as well as weather data to semiosnet software that both records the data and manages the devices growers and their consultants then monitor their crops in real time and isolate insect pressure on a precise area then use remotely controlled dispensers approximately two per hectare to spray pheromones these manipulate the insects’ communication pathways confusing them so that males can’t find females and the bugs can’t reproduce in addition to being nontoxic the pheromone treatments actually cost less than traditional pesticides michael gilbert a chemist and chief scientific officer at semiosbio credits the company’s coup in bringing this product to market to good timing it perfected its alternative to toxic pesticides just as the machinetomachine technology at the heart of the semiosnet system became available semiosbio now has  employees  million in capital investment behind it—plus a recent million injection from the federal government—and  systems in the
