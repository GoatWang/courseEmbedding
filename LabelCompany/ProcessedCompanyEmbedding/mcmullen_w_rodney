a register and receiving product “i learned a lot of course i learned a little of everything about our business which was invaluable” he says “but more importantly i learned about hard work and that being a good coworker means helping each other accomplish what they need to accomplish it was an experience i wouldn’t give up for anything” his experiences at uk served as a firm foundation for his subsequent career path and he is particularly appreciative for the help of the late richard furst “i am grateful for longtime dean richard furst’s guidance both while at kentucky and after i left i had a job when i had to present for my master’s degree and i remember being surprised by his flexibility at the time” says mcmullen “as i got to know him later it was not at all surprising because for dean furst his focus was always on what the student needed to succeed” after graduating in  he worked in a kroger retail division office in charlotte nc in  rodney was appointed financial analyst at kroger’s corporate headquarters in cincinnati ohio he played a pivotal role in implementing kroger’s leveraged restructuring in  which kept the company public and rewarded shareholders mcmullen was

invaluable working every job and shift in the store he even came up with a way to sell more fruit baskets out of the produce sectionironically the only job he wasnt good at was cashier studying to become an accountant he wasnt fast at punching in customers orders into cash registerstoward the end of his studies the local vice president of operations asked him if hed be interested in working for

krogers restructuring – beating off corporate raiders from wall street attempting to take over the company in a leveraged buyoutceo lyle everingham president joe pichler and cfo sinkula pushed through a plan for kroger to borrow more than  billion and distribute it to shareholders in a onetime dividend mcmullen crunched the numbers that predicted the future cash flow needed to pay off the debtthe result was shareholders got a premium for their stock and kroger stayed a public companyhe was so good at doing the calculations in record time pichler recalled he ran with the best on wall streetmcmullen succeeded sinkula as cfo from  to  then began moving into more operations he became the executive vice president of strategy planning and finance in he oversaw the integration of the  billion fred meyer acquisition in  that made kroger the nations largest supermarket chainbut just as kroger found its way to the top the industry competition intensified as never beforefacing the boogeyman from bentonvilletoward the end of pichlers tenure krogers growth began to elude the retailer as nontraditional rivals – drugstores dollar stores and discounters – discovered they could sell more groceries to drive trafficsales had begun to flatten and our divisions said our prices were out of whack with walmart pichler recalledmcmullen was a key player on the team that figured out how much kroger could grow sales if it cut prices then kroger would use the additional money to cut prices further spurring further growth pichler saidfor a time wall street punished the stock because investors were worried the company was pursuing a smaller profitthey were right krogers gross profit margin – the money left after paying for merchandise thats sold to customers but before operating expenses such as labor are paid – has dropped from  percent in  to just  percent in but kroger thrived by taking a smaller slice of a bigger pie as sales doubled in the ensuing years from  billion in  to  billion last year excluding  billion at newly acquired harris teeterkroger continued to refine its strategy to broaden its appeal beyond just pricewhen david dillon became ceo in  kroger developed its customer st strategy the plan was not to beat walmart on price but to be competitive on price and also offer more product variety better service and a more inviting shopping experienceinforming the new strategy was a key investment kroger in  founded a us joint venture with londonbased consumer insights firm dunnhumby the joint venture became the brains behind krogers loyalty card program
