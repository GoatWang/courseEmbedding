technical stock levels can be a good place to start but creating and implementing a plan can be difficult as we all know markets change over time what drives a market during one point in time may not drive the market at a future date knowing what to look for when studying technical levels or fundamentals may help lead down the path to increased profits many investors will choose to study the

after all the research is done and the portfolio is rounded out the time will eventually come when decisions need to be made about whether to hold a winner or sell to lock up some profits often times investors will hold on to a certain stock for much too long letting profits erode thinking that a hot stock will keep going higher and higher may lead to lost profits further down the road on the flip side investors may become emotionally attached to a stock and not be able to part ways when the time has come avoiding the trap of waiting for a stock to bounce back and just break even can lead to the undoing of the portfolio the belief that a particular stock will definitely come back to the buying level may leave investors out in the cold being able to keep the emotions in check and stay
