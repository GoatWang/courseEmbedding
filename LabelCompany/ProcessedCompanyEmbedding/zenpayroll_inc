plan to expand services to include health benefits by zoë henry zoë henry is a staff reporter at inc and a graduate of brown university she lives in brooklyn new york zoelahenry staff writer inczoelahenry write a comment credit gusto formerly called zenpayroll has a plan to reap more customers while eliminating the administrative stresses that businesses often experience on thursday the san franciscobased payroll software company announced its plans to tackle corporate health benefits gustos two new serviceshealth benefits and workers compensationcombined with its existing service would allow both employers and employees to onboard and manage all forms of compensation in one modern product a new workers compensation platform is now available nationwide with health benefits available to california clients the move puts the upstart in direct competition with zenefits a similar if more cemented business that provides free software for companies to manage worker benefits zenefits has been using gustos payrollprocessing technology but is now rumored to be brewing up an algorithm of its own we believe that providers in the market do not do a good job for the customer says gusto cofounder and ceo josh reeves people today think of health insurance as this big chore you have all of these different carrier relationships and insurance types we take on all of that complexity and simplify it that includes filling out associated government or tax forms online for example gusto currently has over  businesses using its payroll system the pricing structure for the core service is simple  per month for a business and  per employee per month presently reeves says gusto processes more than  billion annually in payroll though he declined to discuss revenues significantly he says the company has been planning to expand into managing health benefits since the business first launched in december  reeves hints that related offerings  a k tool for example  could soon be in the works every single category in this market doesnt make sense to us he tells me were excited to go help the customer with all things connected to compensation of course all things is an ambitious undertaking for any upstart and building out the technology to manage it is difficult payroll processing alone involves about  different tax codes reeves explains which are made more complex by the various local regulations depending on where the client has set up shop luckily since gusto already houses the majority of users administrative informationeg worker age salary and dependentsit will be relatively easy for it to migrate this information over to the benefits tool at least one smallbusiness owner is happy with the new service tom sheahan is the founder and ceo of red oxygen an enterprise text messaging company based in san francisco he participated in gustos pilot program red oxygen has  total employees who are spread across the us and australia where the business first launched in  in australia we have a single payer system health care benefits just wasnt an issue sheahan tells inc so when the company set up a presence in the us sheahan recalls being blown away by the associated costs and complicationsincluding a  administration fee per employee per year gusto he says has simplified matters significantly this platform is going to allow small businesses to offer affordable health care he says financially speaking gusto pales in comparison to its now competitor zenefits which has raised more than  million for a unicorn valuation of  billion  still with  total employeeswhich is nearly quadruple what it counted in january of this yearand a hefty  million in venture capital funding gusto has plenty of wind behind its sails reeves even decided it deserved a more powerful name  the word zen is only half of what we do he says of the rebranding theres passion involved we were really inspired by our customers and all of the courage that a business owner has to go start something published on sep   what is zenpayroll read  reviews  itqlickcom zenpayroll   experts review let our payroll software experts help you find the right

to business software solutionshow to evaluate and buy business software   if you’re somehow puzzled if this article is only for a specific size of business no it’s not this is for you smes mnes and startups software buyers also we’re not talking about a specific software solution here whether the software solution that you’re planning to buy is for accounting business intelligence erp crm help desk maintenance management or other types of application one thing is for sure with the help of this article you will be able to know the right process in evaluating and buying a business software solution   we’ve been into the software business for years and we’re seeing a lot of nittygritty things that often bring confusions and hesitations to many companies looking for better software solutions some companies can’t afford to let go their legacy systems while a few is encountering technological snags once the new system is in place while this is the underlying truth behind software acquisition and implementation what’s exciting about buying a business software solution is that there is a clear and obvious proof that thousands of companies and corporations today are happy with the benefits this technology is bringing into their respective businesses  there is a significant increase in their revenue and the growth is ongoing and it’s easy to say many from the fortune  companies are making a lot of money because of their smartlyacquired business software   so let’s get straight to the point what should you do in order to acquire that business software that could make your organization achieve its goals the answer to this is pretty straightforward evaluate and buy that right business software yes that’s what you need to do and here’s the best manual from itqlickcom that could certainly help you in doing that strategically   consider the needs of your organization let’s assume that at this point the entire management team agreed that you are ready to invest on a certain software application the budget has been compromised and the key persons who will be involved in the acquisition process were already identified therefore it’s time to approach things the project management way   define the project every business software solution is categorized base on application type features deployment model market size and pricing model remember that our objective here is to evaluate and buy a business software product that will fit into the size and present needs of your business so what the project management team should try to deal with first is to define the real requirements of your business exactly base on the categories set by the software industry moreover by doing this activity you are already narrowing down your search for the right solution now consider bringing this list of faqs to the project management and aim to come up with clearcut answers   what type of software is needed is it integratedsuite bestofbreed or industryspecific ask your ceo’s main agenda and find the perfect match from these available options what are the core and secondary features are you looking for basic advanced or hiend features list down the specific features per category and allow the department managers and supervisors to give their insights on this list how are you going to deploy the system would it be onpremise cloudbased hosted or mobilebased weigh these options with the help of your cio are you going for tier  tier  or tier  vendors their offered solutions are base on the size of their target market  smes mnes or startups seek your cfo’s advice as it is important to match your financial capacity against the cost of the solution that the providers have for you are you willing to pay for the perpetuity software license or a subscriptionbased solution is way better how many users are there and what would be their roles in using the system solicit feedbacks from future end users for they know better what challenges and risks might possibly come along their way when they’re using the system   finalize the bom or list of requirements after providing definite answers on the above questions we can say that the project has already been defined your procurement team is now ready to do their role in the acquisition process of this solution however in order for them to execute their job properly they must have the complete list of requirements  features specifications hardware and the software product in other words the billofmaterials bom that is final complete and wellprepared must be handed over to the procurement director needless to say it is very important that everybody is following the company purchasing and procurement protocols at all times     request for proposal rfp the rfp process will bring everything into formality since you’re more likely in a line of business that doesn’t regularly buy software products it is of critical importance that your rfp is wellstructured before you send it to your prospect solution providers   draft the rfp an rfp that contains all the relevant information as discussed during the project management meetings will enable the providers to return back to you their proposal that is complete and substantial therefore your rfp should basically contain the following   brief introduction company name mission and goals purpose of the rfp or the need for software solution business background organizational structure current situation it infrastructure system currently inuse system issues and desired solutions etc major objectives of the software purchase request for specific requirements solution functionality system specifications vendor company information price model service plans package options other important inquiries if necessary   send the rfp wellstructured rfp will bring a lot of advantages especially when the proposals from various providers are received and then subjected for review and analysis send your rfp to at least three to five providers or prospects which you have already shortlisted during the project definition phase depending on the complexity of the solution most vendors will send their proposal in a matter of time which could be around  to  weeks for integratedsuite solution   why still send rfp is there really a need for rfp if your preferred solution like cloudbased and the service plans or packages are already displayed on the vendor’s website well yes you still need to undergo the rfp process for most sales people they certainly know that those figures appearing in the vendor’s website are usually the “list price” and not the “actual price” more importantly the vendor’s proposal response to rfp will serve as your main basis for the negotiation therefore sending an rfp is a strict requirement   follow up questions relevant to rfp more often than not questions and concerns will be raised by the vendors to whom you send the rfp you have to entertain them with utmost professionalism solution providers who are seeking further clarifications relevant to the rfp are consisting of professional software experts who wants to help your organization as much as they can entertain them but at the same time always be cautious when providing additional information which you know is confidential or proprietary   evaluate the proposals always refer to your finalized bom when tabulating the contents of each proposal part of this process is to check the features that are available from this certain vendor and to cross out those that are not while using spreadsheet aids the tabulation process laying down the document proposals on the table and allowing your project management team to review them one by one should always be conducted evaluating the proposals in full force can help strengthen your decisionmaking process have another round of brainstorming session and come with the name of your preferred solution provider   when selecting the final vendor always promote the best interest of your organization consider answering these questions with full sincerity   which vendor can provide the longterm benefits to your organization which vendor can provide the best and honest service from acquisition to full implementation which vendor is willing to devote most of its time in better serving its client   contact this solution provider and in your own strategic approach try to get the answers to those three important questions above in most cases vendor who really wants to prove its craft will offer product demos on a higher level others will even invite you to check their already deployed and working systems feel free to connect with this type of vendor conduct simulation and testing be it a cloudbased or onpremise solution examine all aspects and angles especially those that your project management team want to really know indepth for as long as it could help you arrive at a better decision consider doing all the options available – for the interest of the organization   enter the negotiation process most solutions providers can be flexible in terms of pricing although the final say is oftentimes on the mouth of the sales person from the vendor’s side a good negotiation process can always deliver a winwin situation to both parties involve while negotiation sometimes cannot be settled in one sitting session always be honest with your intentions whenever negotiating with your provider if it’s about your budget justify it with clarity if it’s about their service plans tell them what’s lacking or missing on their solution at the end of the day the most important event that should happen is that both of you are shaking hands because of a well done negotiation process   seal the contract so what are you going to do on a contract that involves a significant amount of investment there are three project management approaches for this   pass the ball to you legal team they know what to do and more or less they will tell you if there is something wrong with the contract give them enough time to review before they affix their signature and then finally seal the contract hire a consultant base on the technical aspect that you want to clarify in the contract if it’s the scope of work sow a software implementation expert is the right person if it is related to complex legal terms and conditions a lawyer can help if it has something to do with money invite an accountant to conduct a thorough review and computation if necessary always consider consulting your project management team remember that the cio cfo and ceo are all team members they will be the signatories and they know what’s best for the interest of the company when signing a contract agreement   from evaluation to buying stage it is important that the project manager must take full responsibility of monitoring all the works identified and distributed among team members this is why delegating the right project manager is also an important consideration when buying a business software solution and again itqlickcom wants to emphasize that whatever the size of your company is using the project management approach will always lead you into a better outcome – that is getting what you paid for the right business software solution  finding the right business software for your business proper business software selections are the precursor to successful deployment and business growth finding the right solutions doesn’t have to be complicated and it doesn’t have to take days or weeks of your timeafter researching over  systems we can identify the best solution for companies of all shapes and sizes itqlickcom is  free for software buyers  sep top accounting software for cpas make your practice more productive and profitable with
