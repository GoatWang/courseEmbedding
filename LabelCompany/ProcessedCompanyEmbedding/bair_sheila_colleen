chairman us federal deposit insurance corporation fdic india infoline news service  mumbai  in an exclusive interview with ira of ndtv sheila bair chairman of the us federal deposit insurance corporation says “the us financial sector and the us economy is starting to strengthen” article saved successfully to my page you must be logged in to save article a a  sheila colleen bair the chairman of the us federal deposit insurance corporation fdicshe was appointed to the post for a fiveyear term on june   by george w bush bair will also serve as a member of the fdic board of directors through july  bair was the deans professor of financial regulatory policy for the isenberg school of management at the university of massachusetts amherst a post she had held since  she also served as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the us department of the treasury  to  senior vice president for government relations of the new york stock exchange  to  a commissioner and acting chair of the commodity futures trading commission  to  and research director deputy counsel and counsel to kansas republican senate majority leader robert dole  to  while an academic bair also served on the fdics advisory committee on banking policy sheila bair the chairman of the us federal deposit insurance corporation told ndtv in an exclusive interview that the us financial sector and the us economy is starting to strengthen ms bair expects the us economy to grow by  this year although fears that growth will remain sluggish and uneven for some time to come  she also says that proposals to impose a tax on large banks would help build a reserve for the future which will prevent taxpayers from shouldering the burden of failed financial institutions as they have had to do in the past sheila bair also complimented the indian financial sector saying that strong regulation and supervision had prevented indian banks from facing the kind of concerns that global banks had faced in an exclusive interview with ira of ndtv sheila bair chairman of the us federal deposit insurance corporation says “the us financial sector and the us economy is starting to strengthen” i am sure you have been thrown a number of questions on how things stand back home in the us specially in terms of financial sector let me get your assessment firstly on the health of the financial sector as it stands now every now and then we still keep reading about the regional banks failing that number is growing how sort of obviously improve our conditions in the financial sectors they have improved significantly actually banks had a pretty good first quarter in us billion in net earnings most of the banks were profitable year in year earning the delinquencies of the commercial state allowance which are driving a lot of losses or have been declining increases for several quarters so the poor development construction allowance which has also significant loss those balances are coming down so there is a lot of positive information coming out of the banking sector so we think banks will continue to fill in the elevated bases share but we think we will repeat the share next share will be significantly lower level the banks that are filling this share are lower banks and we are bidding better on the banks we market them and sell them off to help the institution so the bidding has been good the pricing has started to improve so we think lot of positive things about the banking sector that we think to improve with the recovery off bad loans you are saying the pace has come off considerably yes we can say considerably but the construction development allowance which has been the big driver for the losses for smaller banks so the balances are coming down lot of them have been charged up but the new norms are now been made so that’s a good thing on the plus side i think smaller banks continue to land and that’s good smaller banks in us we do want them to land we do want them to make healthy allowance to credit with the we do want the credit intermediation to continue throughout the crisis the smaller banks have continued their jobs kept maintaining their balances in the larger institutions so in the larger institutions there has been some improvement in the quarter too so the credit flow has picked up to consumers to smaller intermediate enterprises in particular so the sense of risk aversion through the banking sector across the globe that’s starting to ease you seems i think these banks have become a more comfortable about the economic recovery they will be more willing to land and they also are preparing their balance sheets lot of banks big banks recapitalize last year to a large degree and the smaller institutions are able to recapitalize as well which is a good thing so again a lot of positive indicators they are some uncertainties still ahead but our economist think that the recovery will continue they are estimating about  growth in gdp this year as ben bernanke has said that there will be sluggish and uneven recovery but recovery will be there but let’s say we are going back the fear after the euro zone debt crisis picked up you know people started talking about the liquidity concerns banks started to hold on to cash once again those were a little over done as the things stand right now yes in the us i think that we were not seeing that so i think obviously that’s a situation where we continue to monitor but i think europeans have come with a stability package so some countries in europe have more short term fiscal issues than others but let’s be honest that all advance countries have their balance sheets to drive stability measures for financial system to avoid prolonged deeper world wise recession so over the long term most of the countries will be dealing with fiscal repair and austerity measures over a period of time but in the near term we thinks there are few countries in terms of the exposure direct exposure that the us banks may have to debt the sovereign debt of these countries you are the direct exposure to the sovereign debt of the countries that have been scrutiny this is not significant for the us banks maam just to shift focus to the reform agenda you know now i think the things are settling down the question is how you prevent something like this from happening again there are a number of pieces of legislation in us that’s been talked about financial sector reform could you give an overview of some of the contours of basic financial sector reforms that you would like to see in places as you move forward well i think we are very pleased with the reforms moving forward through the us congress right now i think they will be completed before the july recess that’s the prediction we think resolution authority is very important to make sure that the regulators have the tools to deal with large financial institutions that get themselves into trouble bankruptcy there is some good work for large financial intermediaries this is why we have always had special resolution for banks but the problem is most of the judicial banking sector so we didn’t really have tools to resolve very large so will have these tools moving forth we think its essential to send the signal to the market that the shareholders and creditors of this large system don’t get into trebled again the shareholders and the creditors will take the losses there will be an orderly resolution process but it will be broken up and sold off any losses will be absorbed by the markets and not the tax payers so that’s what there is in this meeting and that’s very important new consumer protection agency we think is essential for the bank and non bank sector particularly the non bank sector the mortgage generator in the non bank sector are pretty much unregulated leading up to this crisis so having consumer standards across banks and non banks sector more robust i think this bill will have enhanced derivatives over side and then the new system will provide better coordination across the system and dealing with systemic risk as well as the ability to deal with designated institutions that our systemic and this should be high supervision by the fed regardless of whether they want to become make hold companies or not they systemic implications they need to have supervision by the federation and they need be to be very helpful to us going forward just to pick one aspect the start i guess the entire universal banking model which lead to these entities which are now been considered too big to fail weve been grappling with it in herein india as well future to that model it’s better to break it up i think these institutions need to see another on to field and if they can only survive in the market if an employed government backs up then they shouldnt be allowed to survive in the market without implied government support and this is why we think resolution  is important you need to understand that if you invest in these big companies or you invest in their stock you need to know that your money is at risk and you should ask them what they are doing with your money and whether they have proper risk management and what kind of risks are they taking because you are not going to get government help and you are not getting any help if they get themselves into trouble so we think that this is an important signal to send to the market and that with the new resolution regime the cost of capital for these big institutions will go up and there will be market pressures on them to downsize another feature of this bill is that these big entities need to fill a liquidation plans with us in february  and if we feel that they do have the ability to show how they can be broken up and sold off they get themselves into trouble and there are authorities that’s again an important tool i think its not sized that much its interconnected show how transparent they are managed if they are not managed well they will be forced to downsize and the market we think will provide that discipline the other issue which was very much in debate is the entire bank tax issue there are western nations which are in favor of it at the g other countries like india clearly opposed it what are the pros and cons and is it only going to work if it’s a global agreement rather than just one or  countries i don’t think that there needs to be a global agreement i think that there are  kinds of proposals out there right now one is for a bag tax which would be a tax and go into general revenue and that’s been proposed in the us as a general means of paying the govt back what the govt feels is the projected losses from the entire program we aren’t really weighing into that it’s a tax issue not a bank regulation issue there is also a proposal which we do strongly support to have large financial institutions pay into a pre funded reserve to provide the fdic with working capital to resolve one of these large systemic entities if they get into trouble it would only be for working capital so the whole idea of the resolution authority is to provide some bridge funding to keep the entity operational it should break it up and is sold off as the assets are sold off the govt will recoup its money but nonetheless there is a short term need for working capital to keep the entity operational so we think they should be funded in advance by the financial institutions themselves that is the approach that the house bill takes the senate bill sets up a line of credit which we would borrow from to resolve the entity and then the line of credit will be paid once the assets are sold either model is workable i am the kind of person that likes to be paid upfront as opposed to borrowing and then repaying and you would still need a line of credit i think for potential unforeseen needs but we do think it is better to fund the pre funded reserve if possible this is for our deposit insurance fund it is a prefunded reserve it’s not a slush fund it’s not a bailout fund it’s there for specific purpose to protect insurance depositors just as this fund would be for a specific purpose to provide working capital to large financial institutions and resolutions so i think we have a very good track record on that so i don’t think that people will be worried about it being misused we are very religious about protecting these funds and using them only for intended purposes but i don’t know how that debate is going to resolve itself in the us… so as i said it’s like competing proposals now so well see what the conference tells us what’s the reluctance from the international front from what i have read there are a couple of issues one they said that if you don’t have it in all geographies youll see a tendency of banks to move operations to geographies where there isn’t a tax the second argument is that what you do with international banks which have limited operations in the us how would those kinds of issues get resolved i don’t think the size of the fund is such that  you are probably talking about bn from the entire industry to build the fund up over time…so that’s not an insignificant amount of money but it’s not a huge amount given the size of the financial services industry in the us so id be surprised if it had any kind of significant competitive impact perhaps those concerns are overblown if youre talking about like a transaction tax or something like that a true tax that goes into general revenues perhaps global coordination is more important i can see that would generate more revenues it could resolve a competitive differential but what we are talking about and what the european union is talking about is more of a pre funded reserve for institutions the dollar amounts that we are talking about are again built up over time it would surprise me if they would create any real competitive issues then of course there is the whole co rule which is the hot topic of debate you are into reducing risks in terms of derivatives etc where do things stand on that what are the pros and cons and does it hamper in some way the growth of the financial systems especially these large financial entities if you do have such stringent rules being put into place surely there are arguments on both sides so i think we are supportive…i think at least for the insured bag it’s just simply not appropriate it’s supposed not to be allowed now and that we would carry that a step forward and push it out completely even with a bank holding co so i think we are supportive of that and i think some form of that will be part of the final bill there is a separate issue about derivatives pushing derivative activity out of banks and there have been proposals to push those out completely though now i think they are talking about requiring certain types of derivatives activities to be in an affiliated bank and only certain others can be inside the bank i think there you need to differentiate between the types of derivatives i think the cds market has been highly problematic i have a lot of concerns especially speculative cds activity that’s not tied to a legitimate hedging need pushing that off the planet would be fine with me but there are different types of derivatives and different functions and most of what banks do inside banks is interest rates risk derivatives and currency derivatives and by and large there have not been significant problems i think you make a loan to a customer the customer has needs to hedge the interest rate risk and so this is tied to the business of banking so i don’t think it is inappropriate for that to be done and inside banks it’s been done for a long time we need to think hard about what the purpose is of pushing that outside of the banks also if it stays within a bank holding company which are better regulated but still there are uneven capital requirements between affiliated banks and the banks themselves but something else i think congress needs to think about is when you are pushing out activity where are you pushing it is the regulation good is there transparency so we hope the congress thinks through those types of issues but the good news is that we all agree that for the standardized derivative product need to be moved on to central clearing parties that will definitely be part of the final packages it will be very helpful in getting the risk out of the system on a more global level the debate about capital requirements liquidity requirements whether you do it under basel accord or not how is that shaping up because the argument could again be made that if you impose very stringent or capital requirements right now you could hurt growth even further so right now the timing of it and even the need to ease capital and liquidity requirements bad times we can’t do it good times we can’t do it…we need to do it there needs to be some time for transition period obviously but the capital base of the banking system and the non banking financial system needs to be strengthened especially the nonbanking system there is too much leverage going into this and so we need better quality capital we need more capital and at the end of the day a well capitalized financial system will be a capital system that is in a much better position to provide sustainable credit to the economy without getting itself into trouble… without precipitating the kind of crisis we saw leverage was at the heart of that crisis and we need to get those capital requirements up it needs to happen again there needs to be a transition period any impressions within that context that you have picked up on the indian baking system because our regulation and supervision has been pretty strong… whether it’s through capital requirements reserve requirements  also through prudential measures which we have quite actively undertaken in the financial sector any impressions that you have picked up on that model i think that is true and india is in a very good position to learn from our mistakes the good news is that banks in india did not have these complex derivatives cds or cdrs  any of the bad things that caused so many of the losses as we get into the crisis…and we have very strong liquidity requirements… and good capital basis so these are good things to build from…so this is the advantage that india has your thoughts on what the key risks are whether it is the financial sector in particular or the global economy as things stand right now what are the fault lines that you will be looking at well i think it is all about the economy right now so we get feeling good about the economy it’s something that we continue to monitor and i do think that to get more support there needs to be more strategy and withdrawal of all the government support it’s probably not a good idea to do this in stages so it’s really about the economy at this point the insurance banks raised a lot of capital ensuring that the capital bases have been strengthened greatly the smaller banks are also being able to raise capital now as the economy improves so overall the insurance banking system seems to be in a pretty good shape right nowbut againit’s all about the economy source ndtv new delhi television ltd bse    nse    area
