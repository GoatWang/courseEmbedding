 heart failure birth namedavid frank friedman nickname the mighty monarch of exploitation height    m mini bio  david f friedman was born in birmingham alabama his father was a local newspaperman and his mother was a professional musician who played the piano and organ in silentmovie theaters and in churches friedman was exposed to the adult world at the age of four or five when his parents took him out on the town to restaurants movies and stage shows his father already in his s when he was born died when friedman was  his mother remarried a few years later after graduating from high school friedman was drafted into the us army and served in europe during world war ii after his discharge in  he settled in chicago where he married and found work in filmmaking at essanjay films where he knew coowner irwin joseph and they collaborated on making mm and mm underground sex hygiene filmsduring the s friedman worked for paramount pictures as well as essanjay filmswhich later became modern filmsas well as the independent apex attractions in producing and working on a number of short pictures of the underground softcore set friedman met herschell gordon lewis in  while he was working in chicago pitching for producers for his first lowbudget film the prime time  he and lewis formed a partnership with friedman in charge of obtaining production financing to make what were known as nudiecuties very lowbudget crudely made films featuring female nudity which was not seen in mainstream filmsover the next few years friedman and lewis worked as mercenary filmmakers with friedman being the producer and sound man and lewis being the director and cameraman they made a series of softcore sex films the first of which was the adventures of lucky pierre  then daughter of the sun  natures playmates  goldilocks and the three bares  boinng  and their first roughie a softcore sex film with some rather strong violence committed on the female characters called scum of the earth  most of these films were shot on location in and around miami florida during winters when friedman and lewis lived there away from the cold winters in chicagowanting a change of pace away from the nudiecutie exploitation genre friedman and lewis worked together to produce blood feast  which was filmed in miami only a few days after filming their last nudiecutie effort bell bare and beautiful  despite many bad reviews and the low production values blood feast brought in more money than they had gotten making nudiecuties which soon led to their turning out two thousand maniacs  followed by color me blood red  after that friedman ended his partnership with lewis for a variety of reasons both artistic and financial friedman moved to los angeles in  to continue his production work therein  friedman formed his own filmmaking company to make roughies and produced cowrote and codirected the defilers  a lowbudget exploitation film about two guys who kidnap and hold hostage a young woman just for kicks the film was a hit and restarted his career in the softcore field a stream of more roughie and softcore exploitation movies followed throughout the s which he produced cowrote and even acted in some of these were a sweet sickness  casting couch  a smell of honey a swallow of brine  the notorious daughter of fanny hill  the brick dollhouse  the lustful turk  among many othersby  friedmans career began to slide as the hollywood film industry abolished the hays code and adopted the new motion picture association of america mpaa rating system in which independent and hollywood mainstream filmmakers began producing xrated hardcore sex films which soon swept aside the softcore roughie unwilling to get into the hardcore adult film industry which was very profitable but also very illegal friedman turned down several offers to direct hardcore sex films because he felt that it was not as fun as producing or directing the simulated roughie films he continued to produce and direct a number of softcore sex films during the early and mid s such as the adult version of jekyll  hide  the erotic adventures of zorro  come one come all  and the violent grindhouse vigilante flick johnny firecloud in addition to producing friedman also ran a theater in los angeles for several years which ran many of his exploitation films though producing exploitation movies was no longer lucrative he occasionally dabbled in various independent productions in los angeles through the s and into the s by then friedman more or less retired from film producing and resettled back in alabama though he continued to come out of retirement to lend a hand at producing independent erotic or gore horror films as he put it just for fun most recently was when he was reunited with herschell gordon lewis in  to produce blood feast  all u can eat  as well as coproduce a remake of two thousand maniacs that was titled  maniacs   imdb mini biography by matt qvs  corrections by a nonymous spouse  carol friedman    may  her death trivia  coined the term mallseleum to refer to multiplex cinemas after world war ii he bought some brandnew armysurplus searchlights and advertised them for sale his first customer was the king of exploitation kroger babb his meeting with babb led to an association with the showman especially with the producers notorious roadshow attraction mom and dad  because of his film experience as a civilian when he went into the army he was assigned to the signal corps where he attended army film school and was trained in motion picture production distribution and exhibition his first jobs in the industry included a stint as a film booker at a paramount exchange by day and a union projectionist and stagehand by night these jobs were interupted by a draft notice during world war ii he was a partner in modern film distributors lives in retirement since the early s in his home town of birmingham alabama february  owner of entertainment ventures inc a film productiondistribution company unlike many of his fellow exploitation producers friedman came from a wealthy and prominent familyhis father was a newspaper publisher in birmingham alabama and a close friend of us supreme court justice hugo black started with partner dan sonney the pussycat theater chain of adultfilm theaters they sold it to vince miranda in  personal quotes  the whole idea of an exploitation film is to give people most of the show beforehand i never wanted to produce or direct adult hardcore films because my work ethic in exploitation is sell the sizzle not the steak his philosophy on such things as permits and licenses when you ask for permission you got a  chance theyre gonna say no and the other  is gonna be what do i get paid talking about the professionalism and reliability of blood feast  star william kerwin he was what we called in the outdoor show business good allaround show people i have to admit ive made a pretty good living exploiting the lust greed and ignorance of the american public ive got a high school education in making movies but a phd in selling them ive exploited the basest human emotions but the one i exploited most was loneliness thats who was paying my way a lot of very lonely men i put the film in one end of the projector and out of the other end comes money see also other works  publicity listings  official sites  contact
