writings of emanuel swedenborg a scandinavian aristocrat scientist and mystic whose writings carter began to request from business correspondents another critical point came in december  when carter died perhaps another religious experience tinged by illness in  carter wrote british baptist elder john rippon the toleration of slavery indicates very great depravity of mind he also criticized ministers who offered universal redemption but only partial election before creation nonetheless as the baptist church grew more proslavery it grew more popular claiming  members in virginia in  it had become virginias second largest sect a decade later manumitteredit in the years after the revolutionary war virginias legislature having barred the slave trade in  passed several laws sympathetic to freeing slaves although it did not pass a law legalizing manumission until  and throttled many petitions for wider emancipation numerous slaveholders in the chesapeake bay area freed their slaves

one percent before the revolution to  percent by  in delaware threefourths of the slaves had been freed by  in the decade after the acts passage virginians had freed  slaves without visible social disruptions the price of slaves reached a year low as the percentage listed as black tithable ie slaves fell below  the lowest point in the century however virginias courts sidestepped issuing appellate decisions ratifying emancipation until  and the methodology of withinlife emancipation was not established carter hoped a gradual emancipation plan would pass virginias legislature his neighbor ferdinando fairfax published one such plan in a philadelphiabased journal and quaker warner mifflin presented petitions to congress to do the same but james madison buried the proposals in committee in early  carter refused to rent a plantation to charles mynn thruston a revolutionary veteran and anglican minister with whose racial views he disagreed his baptist friend john leland also left virginia after a final antislavery sermon which carter copied in full into his journal carter nonetheless began a personal program of gradual manumission of slaves on his many estates he announced his plan on august   and began a new legal process by recording a deed of gift in northumberland county on september   since the manumission law required a five shilling fee and carter had plantations and slaves in several virginia counties he corresponded with the westmoreland county clerk where he resided and followed up by filing manumission papers at the westmoreland county court sessions the following february may july and august despite resistance of his soninlaw john peck various overseers and tenants carter designed the gradual program to reduce the opposition of slaveowning white neighbors but failed he refused tenants requests to relocate slave breeding women to circumvent the deed of gift that winter carter was shunned although he sought help from fellow slavery opponents including george mason who declined to help and cited his own age and infirmity by the filings of february   carter was ahead of his own planned schedule moreover he refused to relocate freed blacks and began offering them wages as well as grants and tenancies sometimes dispossessing obstreperous white tenants carter began investigating relocating to the district of columbia and leased nomony plantation and its servants to his son jt on april   expressly conditional to the deed of gift then before the next westmoreland court session perhaps victimized by mob action such as tarandfeathers carter and his daughters fled by ship with negro george and negro betty to baltimore on may   he never returned despite numerous entreaties the meetinghouse used for the yeocomico baptist church burned down six months after carter left carter saved an unsigned complaining letter which he believed from thruston that compared the deed of gift to fire destroying neighbors houses later life and deathedit upon reaching baltimore carter received the devastating news that his son robert bladen had died in london nine days after being assaulted by a city sheriff trying to collect gambling debts nonetheless carter joined the congregation of james jones wilmer an episcopalian minister receptive to swedenborgs views bought a small house on green street and began attending many religious meetings before leaving nomony hall carter locked his books and papers in the library and gave the only key not to his son jt but to a wandering baptist preacher named benjamin dawson dawson proved a corrupt debt collector but diligent abolitionist duly securing legal papers from carter in baltimore and filing them in westmoreland and other counties to free slaves carter made provision for his relatives allocating them land but not the slaves who were the subject of the deed of gift on july   upon learning from dawson that attorney john wickham doubted the legal validity of the power of attorney which allowed dawson to file further manumission papers carter executed an agreement selling dawson his remaining slaves for the nominal sum of a dollar which dawson duly filed with the westmoreland clerk despite a beating by carters soninlaw spencer ball carter spent the last decade of his life issuing manumission papers pursuant to his recorded program writing letters in support of freed slaves whose papers had been stolen and contemplating religious and political issues carter lent money to baltimore to build its city hall negotiated with the bank of the united states and donated money to haitian refugees carter also thought he lived too long—mourning his daughter annes death in childbirth in  and the deaths of rev lunsford and his soninlaw john maund in caroline county virginia the following year in  the year before his death carter wrote his daughter harriet l maund my plans and advice have never been pleasing to the world citizen robert carter as he preferred to be called died in his sleep unexpectedly on march   his son and executor george brought the corpse back to nomony and buried it in the garden the same day that george announced his fathers death he bought slaves for nomony to replace those his father had freed over his objection on april   rev thruston acting as judge of frederick county virginia refused to allow dawson to record the scheduled deed for emancipation for that year perhaps because of george carters objection but on march   the virginia court of appeals upheld dawsons objection declared the county court had erred and authorized liberation of the slaves illegally held in bondage dawson continued to free sons and daughters born after  to carters slaves as did thomas buck and john rust after  see alsoedit

years carter began the process of manumitting  slaves in his lifetime contents  early life and career  patriot  slaveholder and spiritual seeker  conversion  manumitter  later life and death  see also  notes  references  external links early life and careeredit carter was the grandson of virginia land baron robert king carter of corotoman in  both his father and grandfather died leaving the young boy in the care of his uncles george charles and landon carter as well as his mother who remarried in  to john lewis of warner hall in gloucester county at age  young robert was sent to the college of william and mary and in  he came of age and received his inheritance after crossing the atlantic ocean to liverpool with lawrence washington carter travelled to london where he and philip ludwell lee started legal studies at the inner temple carter returned to virginia in  before being admitted to the bar he took up residence at the nomony hall and unsuccessfully campaigned at least twice for a seat in the house of burgesses although carter did secure an appointment to the westmoreland county court in  carter left virginia again in  and married frances ann tasker daughter of former maryland governor benjamin tasker they ultimately had seventeen children of which eight daughters and four sons reached adulthood the successful marriage seemed to settle carter who began to pay attention to his vast landholdings as well as politics in  using his inlaws connections with the board of trade carter secured an appointment by king george ii to the virginia governors council when king george iii succeeded his grandfather in  carter was reappointed to the post which served as the colonys appellate court as well as advised on executive matters he purchased a house in williamsburg from his cousin robert carter nicholas and moved his growing family there in  carter whom john page once called illiterate began reading voraciously as well as socializing with the citys intellectuals including governor fauquier george wythe william small john blair and young thomas jefferson patriotedit at first loyal to his king carter expressed support for the crown during the period of popular rejoicing that accompanied news of george iiis repeal of the stamp act however parliament passed additional laws obnoxious to colonial interests and by  the new governor dunmore exacerbated tensions that year carter moved his ailing family having lost three young daughters to unknown illnesses within  months back to nomony hall announcing his retirement from public life carter never appeared in the governors council minutes other than as present after it voted to allow slaveholders or local authorities to punish slaves without due process moreover rather than educate his sons at the college of william and mary carter hired philip fithian as tutor carter concentrated his efforts on trade including ironworks a textile factory and a flour mill in addition to draining swamps around nomony and diversifying crops at all his plantations although publicly neutral carter honored the continental boycott declared in  and in  joined richard corbin in expressing the councils concern about rumors of british marines being stationed at williamsburg carter declined to give the loyalty assurances dunmore required and dunmore dissolved the council in  carter did give a loyalty oath to the new commonwealth of virginia the following summer although carter also declined political offices mentioned by patriot friends he began supplying provisions and bayonets to the american cause in the revolution so british ships raided his plantations near the potomac river slaveholder and spiritual seekeredit although his greatgrandfather john carter had freed slaves in his will as well as provided homesteads and livestock for them manumission became illegal in the year carters father and grandfather died and did not again become legal until  king carter in fact had greatly expanded slavery in virginia purchasing many off ships and owning more than a thousand slaves upon his death king carter gave his grandson his first slave a girl when he was just three months old by the time he came of legal age in  robert carter iii owned  acres of land and  slaves although carter sold land and some slaves to pay his debts in  he did not purchase slaves unlike george washington and other neighbors and in fact became known for his humane treatment carters plantations had roughly double the rate of slave population increase as others in the state carter was particularly moved by the example of governor fauquier who in his will allowed his slaves to choose their masters when carter became a coadministrator of his fatherinlaws estate he with the support of daniel dulany delayed scheduling a sale of the slaves of belair plantation since that would break up families although his procrastination led to more than  years of litigation with his tasker inlaws furthermore carter rarely whipped slaves or allowed them to be whipped let alone scarred them although he whipped his children particularly his eldest son robert bladen conversionedit carter became known for his religious freethinking and support of dissenters even before the revolution he resigned from the cople parish church vestry in  and during the following year had a mystical experience while feverish from smallpox inoculation this prompted further spiritual seeking from composing his own prayer for god to have pity upon all jews turks infidels  hereticks to making trips to experience quaker methodist presbyterian and baptist preachers as well as investigating arminianism and perhaps catholicism although such was illegal in virginia at the time on september   the rev lewis lunsford baptised carter in totuskey creek carter scandalized neighbors further by joining morattico baptist church a mixed congregation of white and black free and slave carter knew he risked persecution for eleazar clay another wealthy man had his life threatened after conversion and during the three weeks preceding his own baptism carter attended two different services that were attacked by armed mobs which included revolutionary war veterans frances ann tasker carter who was declared an invalid in october  after the birth of their th child moved to bladensburg maryland for health reasons and eventually converted to the baptist faith there a year before her death in  meanwhile carter became a prominent baptist serving on its general association financing the foundation of several churches in the northern neck and corresponding with eminent ministers the noted methodist missionary and antislavery activist francis asbury also lodged at nomony hall at least twice after carters baptist conversion carter believed human slavery immoral and tried to pass his beliefs to his children however his eldest son robert bladen although an admirer of the poet phyllis wheatley at least twice sold young female slaves against his fathers wishes he also gambled and incurred such large debts that when robert bladen fled to england in  his father was compelled to liquidate not only lands but also slaves and thus break up families moreover in  his soninlaw john peck sold slaves given to his daughter anne tasker as a dowry before their northward move so carter gave his remaining daughters dowries which excluded human property in february  carter decided to send his youngest sons george and john tasker carter to the new baptist university in rhode island what is now brown university and wrote to its minister president james manning i beg leave to appoint you their foster father intimating that my desire is that both my said sons shd be active characters in life the prevailing notion now is to continue the most abject state of slavery in this commonwealth – on this consideration only i do not intend that these my two sons shall return to this state till each of them arrive to the age of  years in november  carter sent three daughters to live with baptist friends in baltimore instructing their hosts girls are not to act by a maid but by themselves although he also sent a slave as barter for their room and board during the s even the baptist church began to segregate its meetings tumult rocked the general committee after the ketocton association passed a motion that hereditary slavery was contrary to the word of god and morattico baptist church changed its rule to allow only free male members to vote the grieving widower responded by drafting a charter for yeocomico church which required egalitarian voting then left morattico for the splinter congregation signing its charter below the signatures of several slaves carter also unsuccessfully ran for a position in the virginia ratification convention he experienced several bouts of illness cared for by his daughter sarah fairfax whose proposed marriage to richard bland lee carter postponed perhaps because of the suitors proslavery ideas carter continued to host spiritual seekers including a mr moyce who in january  introduced him to the writings of emanuel swedenborg a scandinavian aristocrat scientist and mystic whose writings carter began to request from business correspondents another critical point came in december  when carter died perhaps another religious experience tinged by illness in  carter wrote british baptist elder john rippon the toleration of slavery indicates very great depravity of mind he also criticized ministers who offered universal redemption but only partial election before creation nonetheless as the baptist church grew more proslavery it grew more popular claiming  members in virginia in  it had become virginias second largest sect a decade later manumitteredit in the years after the revolutionary war virginias legislature having barred the slave trade in  passed several laws sympathetic to freeing slaves although it did not pass a law legalizing manumission until  and throttled many petitions for wider emancipation numerous slaveholders in the chesapeake bay area freed their slaves often in their wills like quaker john pleasants or deeds and noted principles of equality as reason for their decisions the number of free african americans increased in the upper south from less than one percent before the revolution to  percent by  in delaware threefourths of the slaves had been freed by  in the decade after the acts passage virginians had freed  slaves without visible social disruptions the price of slaves reached a year low as the percentage listed as black tithable ie slaves fell below  the lowest point in the century however virginias courts sidestepped issuing appellate decisions ratifying emancipation until  and the methodology of withinlife emancipation was not established carter hoped a gradual emancipation plan would pass virginias legislature his neighbor ferdinando fairfax published one such plan in a philadelphiabased journal and quaker warner mifflin presented petitions to congress to do the same but james madison buried the proposals in committee in early  carter refused to rent a plantation to
