management maturity scale the product management maturity scale written by brian lawley  posted on mar    category product management  background here at the  group we have worked with thousands of companies over the past eighteen years to help them optimize product management and get the function to the next level throughout the course of our work we have noticed that there are three levels that companies typically fall into in terms of how effective and mature their product management function is thus we developed our product management maturity scale levels of the product management maturity scale the first level is ad hoc this tends to be startups though there are many midsize and even large companies that fall into this in many cases companies that are at the ad hoc level don’t even have product management at all or they may have hired someone with little or no experience to be a product manager in startups the founders tend to be the product visionaries and drive the early product feature set and roadmaps this can work well but the challenge is that founders often don’t have the business background or the experience of having actually launched a product and taken it through the full product lifecycle so mistakes sometimes fatal may be made ad hoc product management is characterized by often requiring “heroic” efforts to get products to market because there is little or no planning process or role definition each new release of the product becomes a “oneoff” where the wheel has to be reinvented the team and company suffer from unnecessary stress and burnout and the product often suffers and doesn’t succeed at the level that it could the next level is partially defined in companies where the product management function is partially defined there will be more structure in place including somewhat of a process role clarification and a reduction of the problems encountered in an ad hoc environment product managers in this environment tend to be highly tactical rather than strategic and a few may have been trained to do the job but most are learning as they go through trial and error or from a handful of others who are more experienced note less than  of all product manager have ever gone through formal training to learn how to do their jobs effectively the company usually has somewhat of an idea of the importance of the role yet there still may not be someone who is the strategic driver behind the products and the overall revenue and profitability may be much lower than it might be if the company had a strategic product management capability the final level is optimized in companies with great product management the people processes and tools have all been optimized to work together holistically and effectively the process and roles are clear and streamlined and the executives and stakeholders who work with product managers understand the value they bring to the company product managers are fully trained on the entire product lifecycle foundational skills people and leadership skills and oftentimes have earned advanced certifications they have the knowledge environment and skill set to step up and become strategic product leaders the result is that profitability and customer satisfaction are maximized and the company reaps dramatic benefits so where does your company fit in are you ad hoc partially defined or optimized the recent  group product management challenges survey of over  product management professionals showed that respondents believed that profits would increase  on average by fully optimizing product management at their company yet a large majority  indicated they have no plan to do the optimization if you are interested in getting your product management organization to the next level consider working with a firm like the  group and taking advantage of their capabilities to help you do an overall assessment build an optimization plan and then help roll it out within your company

solution management the product management role has content authority for the program backlog they are responsible for identifying customer needs prioritizing features and developing the program vision and roadmap in a similar manner solution management has the content authority for the solution backlog they work with customers to understand their needs create the solution vision and roadmap define requirements and guide work through the solution kanban leanagile enterprises focus on delivering the right solutions to customers with the highest quality in the shortest lead times this requires people with clear content authority to take responsibility for continuously defining prioritizing and validating requirements working closely with development in short integrated learning cycles they bring the voice of the customer to the developers and the voice of development to the customer in accordance with principle  – decentralized decisionmaking safe prescribes a content authority chain that extends through three levels solution management is responsible for guiding the solutions that constitute the solution product management is responsible for program vision and backlog and finally product owners make fast local content decisions on behalf of the agile team this article describes the important roles that product managers and solutions managers play in safe while the roles are similar in most respects they operate at different levels of the solution and manage different concerns details product management and solution management are the main content authority for the program and solution backlogs respectively they create the vision and  work with customers to understand their needs define requirements and guide work through the solution and program kanbans they prioritize work using wsjf schedule feature and capabilities for release using the roadmap validate customer response and provide fast feedback a leanagile approach to content management what safe describes as content has traditionally been represented by a marketing requirements document mrd product requirements document and system and software requirements specifications srs in waterfall development these specifications were typically done up front with an expectation that all the requirements could be established in advance of solution development however it didn’t work out all that well that way and the move to a leanagile approach is driven in large part by that result we now understand that assumptions about requirements design and architecture all need to be validated through actual development testing and experimentation  and that teams must be open to emerging knowledge that can be quickly fed back into the solution in safe continuous exploration is the process used to continually explore market and user needs and defining a vision roadmap and set of features and capabilities that address those needs as we see in solution intent some of the requirements of the solution are likely to be well understood and fixed from the beginning while others are variable and can only be understood during the development process managing this new approach is the primary responsibility of product and solution management in the lean enterprise these responsibilities must be fulfilled in a far more agile manner as is illustrated in table   responsibility traditional agile understand customer need upfront and discontinuous constant interaction with the customer who is part of the value stream other techniques include customer visits gemba walks elicitation eg such as interviews and surveys brainstorming trade studies market research document requirements fully elaborated in documents handed off highlevel vision constant product and solution backlog refinement and informal facetoface communication with agile teams schedule created in hardcommitted roadmaps and milestones at the beginning continuous nearterm roadmapping prioritize requirements not at all or perhaps onetime only often in requirements document form reprioritized at every pi boundary via wsjf constant scope triage validate requirements not applicable qa responsibility primary role involved with iteration and pi system demos acceptance criteria included fitness for purpose understood manage delivery schedule typically one time fixed well in advance released frequently whenever there is enough value manage change change avoided—weekly change control meetings change embraced adjusted at pi and iteration boundaries table  changes in product and solution management behavior in a leanagile enterprise responsibilities of product management the following section describes the primary responsibilities of the product manager in the context of a single agile release train for larger multipleart solution trains additional responsibilities are necessary those are described in later sections understand customer needs and validate solutions product management is the internal voice of the customer for the art and works with customers as well as product owners to constantly understand and communicate their needs and participate in validation of the proposed solutions understand and support portfolio work every art lives in the context of a portfolio so product management has a responsibility to understand the budget parameters for the upcoming fiscal period understand how strategic themes influence the strategic direction and work with epic owners to develop the business case for epics that affect their art develop and communicate the program vision and roadmap product management continuously develops and communicates the vision to the development teams and defines the features of the system in collaboration with system and solution architectengineering they also define and maintain the nonfunctional requirements nfrs to help ensure that the solution meets relevant standards and other system quality requirements they are responsible for the roadmap which illustrates at a high level how features are intended to be implemented over time manage and prioritize the flow of work product management manages the flow of work though the program kanban and into the program backlog product management is responsible for making sure that there are enough ready features in the backlog at all times to be ready they develop feature acceptance criteria that can be used to establish that the feature meets its definition of done dod and since judicious selection and sequencing of features is the key economic driver for each art the backlog is reprioritized with wsjf prior to each pi planning session participate in pi planning during each pi planning session product management presents the vision which highlights the proposed features of the solution along with any relevant upcoming milestones they also typically participate as business owners for the train with the responsibility of approving pi objectives and establishing business value define releases and program increments owning the ‘what’ means that product management is largely responsible for release definition as well including new features architecture and allocations for technical debt this is accomplished through a series of program increments and releases whose definition and business objectives are also determined by product management product management works with release management where applicable to decide when enough value has been accrued to warrant a release to the customer work with system architectengineering to understand enabler work while product management is not expected to drive technological decisions they are expected to understand the scope of the upcoming enabler work and to work with system and solution architectengineering to assist with decisionmaking and sequencing of the key technological infrastructures that will host the new business functionality this can often best be accomplished by establishing a capacity allocation as described in program backlog participate in demos and inspect and adapt product management is an active participant in biweekly system demos including the aggregate one at the end of the pi they are also involved in assessment of metrics including evaluation of business value achieved versus plan and are active participants in the inspect and adapt workshop build an effective product managerproduct owner team though the product owner and product management roles may report to different organizations forming an effective extended product managementproduct owner team is the key to efficient and effective development such a team also contributes materially to the job satisfaction that comes with being part of a highperforming team one that routinely delivers on its quality and vision commitments product management’s participation in large value streams the above section highlights the role of product management in the context of the art for teams building large solutions that require multiple arts product management has additional responsibilities collaborate with solution management at the large solution level solution management plays a similar role but with a focus on the capabilities of the larger solution but building an effective solution is no more effective than the collaboration between the two roles this collaboration involves participation in solution backlog refinement and prioritization as well as splitting capabilities into features and nfrs as the case may be participate in pre and postpi planning product management also participates in the prepi planning meeting working with the value stream stakeholders to define the inputs milestones and highlevel objectives for the upcoming pi planning session in the postpi planning session product management helps synthesize findings into an agreedto set of solution pi objectives participate in the solution demo product management participates in the solution demo often demonstrating the capabilities that their art has contributed and reviewing the contributions of the other arts always with a systems view and always with an eye toward fitness of purpose collaborate with release management in largerscale systems release management also plays a significant role product management works with the key stakeholders on progress budget release strategy and releasability of their elements of the solution responsibilities of solution management solution management plays much the same role that product management plays but at the large solution level there solution management is part of a critical trio—solution management solution train engineer and solution architectengineering—that shares much of the responsibility for solution success solution management is responsible for the solution intent which captures and documents fixed and variable solution level behaviors they also work with release management where applicable responsibilities include working with portfolio stakeholders customers arts  and solution trains to understand needs and build and prioritize the solution backlog they have similar vision roadmap solution kanban and solution demo activities as well solution management plays a crucial role in pre and postpi planning as well as large solutionlevel inspect and

becoming one of the most important ingredients for the profitability and increased customer traffic at grocery natural products and even convenience store locations several factors are driving the importance of deli among today’s consumers more than ever busy consumers are seeking more prepared foods when grocery shopping in the age of high definition tv and the enhanced home theater experience many consumers are choosing to stay home for entertainment and selecting preprepared meals as their dining preference studies show that consumers are spending less on going outtoeat while many may visit the local fast food place they’re less likely to go to a fine dining restaurant “when the  adults that were surveyed were asked if they have eaten more or less frequently at several types of restaurants over the last six months “less frequently” considerably outweighed the “more frequently” responses  though they are spending less time out at restaurants consumers still seem to get their fast food fix with  of respondents reporting a visit to a fast food restaurant chain the last six months  only  have visited a fine dining restaurant chain” – wwwfranchwirecomfranchisegrowth further today’s consumers are becoming more health conscious and are less likely to trust the food found in many dining restaurants which is often designed to maximize taste at the least amount of cost which normally equates to higher fats salts and highly choleric dishes catapult retailers many of which are health and nutrition stores are positioned to take advantage of this shift in consumer preferences the growth and importance of the deli is not new information to our current user base many of these customers currently have a very active deli many are so busy during peak hours such as lunchtime they have a catapult pos terminal installed in the deli area to process the rush of customers catapult integrates directly with invatron’s eplum™ enterprise scale manager   eplum allows catapult to
