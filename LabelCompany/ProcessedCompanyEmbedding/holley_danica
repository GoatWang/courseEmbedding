company profile information business description history background information on holley performance products inc  russellville roadbowling green kentucky usa company perspectives for over a century since before the holley brothers company was founded in  the holley name has been synonymous with high performance history of holley performance products inc holley performance products inc based in bowling green kentucky is a major manufacturer of aftermarket components used in racing street marine powersports and industrial highperformance engines holleys extensive product lines include performance carburetors superchargers intake manifolds ignition systems fuel pumps exhaust systems internal engine components and engine kits the company also produces remanufactured carburetors and fuel injection components in addition to holley brands include nos hooker weiand flow tech general kinetics lunati earls and annihilator holley performance products are found at major retailers such as advance auto parts autozone and oreilly holley brothers as automotive pioneers at the dawn of the th century the founders of the company that would evolve into todays holley performance products were brothers george and earl holley who grew up in bradford pennsylvania the eldest george was born in  and earl was born three years later at a young age george became fascinated with motorcycles and the internal combustion engine in the s there had been some experimentation in powering a bicycle with a steam engine but the combination proved far too bulky then came the invention of the fourcycle gasoline engine by nikolaus august otto a german engineer named gottlieb daimler who worked with otto began developing engines and a reliable selffiring ignition system in order to propel a vehicle he and his collaborator wilhelm maybach first powered a boat with their engine then in  fitted it to a wooden bicycle frame producing the worlds first motorcycle almost  years would pass before the motorcycle developed into a truly commercial vehicle in the meantime daimler and maybach moved on to produce one of the earliest automobiles and form daimler motor company daimlers legacy is still recalled in the name of one of todays top automakers daimlerchrysler george holley was one of many inventors who followed in daimler and maybachs footsteps as a teenager he built and raced his own motorcycles and earl soon began to help him in  they designed and built a threewheeled singlecylinder automobile capable of going  miles per hour which they dubbed the runabout earl was working as a bank teller when in  the yearold put his limited business knowledge to work by joining forces with his brother to form holley motor company to manufacture motorcycle engines earl serving as president handled the administrative end while george the chairman of the concern was in charge of engineering and sales the demand for motorcycle engines however proved to be limited because what customers wanted were complete motorcycles the brothers began making motorcycles and george promoted the business with his considerable driving skills in  he won the first motorcycle endurance contest and set a number of world speed records for motorcycles at the prestigious pan american exposition in buffalo new york introducing the iron pot carburetor in  the holley brothers turned their focus to automobiles after they gained the us rights to a french carburetor in  they produced their first fourwheel automobile the holley motorette and although they would sell more than  over the next three years the holley brothers sensed the need to specialize as the automotive industry began to sort itself out they were approached by henry ford in  to produce carburetors for the model t and along with partner george welch they formed a new corporation holley brothers company to produce carburetors as well as ignitionsystem components in  they introduced their first carburetor the iron pot for use in the curveddash oldsmobile when it also began to be used by ford the brothers decided to move their operations from bradford to detroit the heart of the rapidly growing us automotive industry their first detroit plant opened in  the same year that their ignition business got a boost when a car using a holley magneto won a major hour race over the next ten years the holley brothers prospered in detroit growing in tandem with ford and even starting a plant to produce a kerosene carburetor for ford tractors in  henry ford who liked to control all aspects of automobile manufacture decided to acquire the holleys car carburetor business following the sale the brothers reorganized around the tractor division forming holley kerosene carburetor company and in addition to ford they began selling their product to chevrolet and international harvester during world war i holley not only sold carburetors and ignition components to the army but also brass heads for artillery shells in the final year of the war because they were no longer limited to the manufacture of kerosene carburetors the brothers changed their company name to holley carburetor company in the s the holleys branched out into a number of directions in  they built another detroit factory which included an advanced research facility it was also during this period that the company began to provide carburetors for the airplane industry only used at first by curtisswright holleys airplane carburetors were quickly adopted by american airlines and panamerican airlines as well as the us coast guard and armed forces around the world in  the company introduced a variable venturi carburetor that overcame icing problems the popular dc airplane adopted the new carburetor and then during world war ii it was adapted for use by bombers and pt boats also during the s holley expanded its range of automotive parts to include distributors circuit breakers heat regulators and fuel pumps to help support the growing business in  holley opened yet another plant this one in portland michigan the extra capacity would soon be vitally needed for the war effort according to holley half of all carburetors used by us troops were made by its factories whether they were used in cars trucks boats or airplanes because of wartime restrictions new commercial vehicles were not produced during world war ii with the economy booming after a decade of depression and pentup consumer demand the automotive industry was set for a period of explosive growth holley with a second generation getting ready to take charge of the business also was prepared to prosper in the postwar environment in  the company opened a new plant in clare michigan and two years later a factory in paris tennessee during this period holley introduced fuel control devices for gas turbine and jet airplane engines the company also began to produce a line of side air inlet carburetors for use in trucks and buses on the automotive side holley improved ignition efficiency by developing the first pressure distributor to accommodate the new robust automobiles that americans wanted holley brought out a fourbarrel carburetor in addition the company became involved in the aftermarket business offering genuine holley parts and carburetor repair kits the s saw a number of changes at holley in  the main detroit plant was closed and a new factory was established in warren michigan holley then moved into bowling green kentucky opening a factory in  the following year management began to turn over the reins to a new generation earl holley retired from daytoday responsibilities and george holley jr became president of the company also taking top positions were danforth holley director of cost savings and jack holley vicepresident of sales earl holley stayed on as vicechairman of the corporation until his death in  older brother george outlived him eventually passing away in  at the age of  as automobiles changed during the s becoming ever more powerful holleys research and development team kept pace todays modular carburetor is the result of work from this time which resulted in the development of the fourbarrel carburetor used in the  tbird on the other side of the spectrum compact cars also were becoming popular with the carbuying public to accommodate the specific needs of this market holley designed a single bore carburetor which was then modified for each compact model in  holley manufactured its  millionth carburetor although the carburetor remained the companys signature product holley had branched into numerous other directions since the introduction of the iron pot not only were holley parts sold around the world in  a european subsidiary opened a factory in turin italy to manufacture carburetors governors and fuel pumps overseas to take the next step in growing its business as well as achieving diversification holley chose in  to merge with colt industries in a taxfree merger colt ultimately changed its name to coltec industries a company with aerospace and industrial operations in addition to automotive parts holley merged its clare michigan operation with colts chandlier aircraft division and renamed as holley replacement parts the business began a period of expansion factories in water valley mississippi and sallisaw oklahoma were acquired in  and the paris tennessee facility built a test laboratory holleys popular dominator racing carburetor which was launched in  was now modified to produce a consumer line of dominator intake manifolds to accommodate fuelefficient cars which were becoming increasingly more important the company developed economy carburetors to fill out their product line in  holley also became involved in the fuel injection market around  holley reached its peak in employment with  workers also at this time the company decided to stop manufacturing originalequipment carburetors and focus on the growing autoracing market by the mids employment dipped below  holley replacement parts division was renamed holley performance products in  and subsequently moved its administrative offices to bowling green kentucky as well as its warehouse operations which had been located in goodlettsville tennessee in addition a stateofthe art research and development center was built in the bowling green facility a detroit sales office however was retained to serve automakers and other regional customers as a result of these changes all of holleys operations were brought closer together allowing for greater efficiency and better coordination centralization was especially helpful in bringing new products to the market with engineering research and development testing and manufacturing better able to function as a team product development also was enhanced by the rise of new technologies from modeling techniques to automated production equipment and assembly systems managementled buyout in  coltec decided in  to focus its resources on the aerospace and industrial divisions and it began to divest itself of its automotive components businesses in  jeffrey g king was named president of the holley performance products division he came to the company with ten years of experience at arvin industries an automotive systems and components company and three years at lincoln brass works where he quickly rose to the rank of executive vicepresident and chief operating officer after only a year with holley in  king led a management group in a buyout of the subsidiary which at the time was generating annual sales of  million sponsoring the buyout was kohlberg  co a private merchant banking firm operating out of mount kisco new york kohlberg invested  million in the  million deal gaining a  percent stake in holley king quickly made it known that the newly independent company would be aggressive about buying into new markets and was especially interested in moving into the expanding power sports area which in addition to motorcycles included personal watercraft snowmobiles and four wheelers kings vision in essence was to make holley into a onestop shop for engines with the intention of controlling the fuel air from the point it entered an engine to where it exited through the exhaust king soon backed up his words with actions as over the next two years holley completed a number of acquisitions on the day the management buyout was completed in fact the company announced the acquisition of the fuel injection division of floridabased hirel technologies which added to holleys marine product line several months later in november  weiand automotive industries of los angeles was acquired weiand was a highly regarded name in the performance market manufacturing intake manifolds water pumps and supercharger technology for the marine street performance and racing markets also that month holley acquired lunati cams and lunati pistons of memphis tennessee adding lines of camshafts crankshafts pistons and connecting rods in october  holley bought the marine and automotive supercharger division of bm racing and performance products of chatsworth california holley soon made other important acquisitions adding hooker headers and flowtech exhaust systems of phoenix arizona followed by the purchase of nitrous oxide systems inc nos to support its growing stable of subsidiaries and product lines holley supplemented its salesforce by forming strategic alliances with several regional sales agencies in  also in that year holley added to its production capacity by striking a deal to move into a squarefoot facility in aberdeen mississippi the building jointly owned by the city of aberdeen and the county was formerly used by walker manufacturing co to produce automobile exhaust systems holley personnel originally visited the site to consider buying some of walkers equipment but quickly recognized that the plant which had undergone major renovations was an attractive site moreover walker was leaving behind an available trained workforce with walker also leaving a vacuum in the local economy holley was able to negotiate favorable terms from area officials operations at aberdeen began in january  with  percent of the workforce former walker employees holley was then able to close an arizona facility as well as two mexican plants which had been purchased only two years earlier and transfer those operations to aberdeen with a downturn in the economy the level of new business failed to meet holleys expectations and aberdeen employed only about  instead of the  originally projected as a consequence the bowling green distribution center did not hire an additional  workers as planned although holley was now generating  million in annual revenues it was not performing at an acceptable level in august  king resigned and was replaced by the chairman of the board james wiggins who announced his goal of making holley into a lean manufacturing operation several days later  employees were laid off holley approached its centennial as an important player in the aftermarket parts industry to celebrate its past the company prepared a fleet of ten unique stock vehicles representing the ten decades of the companys history each one relying heavily on holley highperformance parts one of the two existing motorettes would be part of the touring show with  years of
