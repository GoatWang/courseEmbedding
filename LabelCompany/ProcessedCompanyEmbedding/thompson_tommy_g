national reform of the program under his leadership wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost  cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care especially for lowincome working families thompson was called a pioneer for two key initiatives of his governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for medicaid through the federal waiver program thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became secretary of health and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words numbers and even entire sentences from appropriations bills in his first two terms alone he used the lineitem veto  times to cancel a total of  million in spending none of these vetoes were overridden thompsons welfare reform policies were criticized wendell primus of the center on budget and policy priorities suggested that many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare many of wisconsins poor remained well below the federal poverty line in addition

tax in  cutting income tax rates three times and a  billion property tax cut in  when thompson made the same claim in  that he never raised taxes he earned a rating of false from politifactwisconsin politifact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during thompsons terms politifact said in its rating thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and on balance he can claim to have reduced taxes but he also raised some specific taxes along the way politifact rated mostly true thompsons claim that wisconsins overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a budget bill in  thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax that would have largely affected the wealthy at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits executive power consolidationedit

tribes to sell their treatyguaranteed rights the lac du flambeau band of lake superior chippewa for  million and the mole lake band of lake superior chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the ojibwa since it was violence by nonnative american

by almost  cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care especially for lowincome working families thompson was called a pioneer for two key initiatives of his governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for medicaid through the federal waiver program thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became secretary of health and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words numbers and even entire sentences from appropriations bills in his first two terms alone he used the lineitem veto  times to cancel a total of  million in spending none of these vetoes were overridden

said in its rating thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and on balance he can claim to have reduced taxes but he also raised some specific taxes along the way politifact rated mostly true thompsons claim that wisconsins overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a budget bill in  thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax that would have largely affected the wealthy at the

superior chippewa for  million and the mole lake band of lake superior chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge

for being one of the speakers at the conference the national director of the antidefamation league abraham foxman later wrote of the incident that there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes about jews and finances have become than thompsons belief that repeating an ageold stereotype about jews and money would please his jewish listeners after the event

defeating democrat ed garvey a wisconsin deputy attorney general – tenureedit thengovernor thompson meets president bill clinton  thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system these reforms were implemented and pioneered before congress and president clinton undertook national reform of the program under his leadership wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost  cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care especially for lowincome working families thompson was called a pioneer for two key initiatives of his governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for medicaid through the federal waiver program thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became secretary of health and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words numbers and even entire sentences from appropriations bills in his first two terms alone he used the lineitem veto  times to cancel a total of  million in spending none of these vetoes were overridden thompsons welfare reform policies were criticized wendell primus of the center on budget and policy priorities suggested that many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare many of wisconsins poor remained well below the federal poverty line in addition slightly more of the states poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before thompsons welfare overhaul the growth of the state budget during thompsons year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the  us senate primary transportation focusedit while governor thompson was appointed to the amtrak board of directors by president bill clinton served as chairman and had an amtrak locomotive named for him from  through  when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul thompson is a rail enthusiast and was a supporter of mass transit which earned him distrust on the issue from other republicans prior to being selected as hhs secretary thompson made clear that his first choice in the bush administration would be secretary of transportation taxesedit in  thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in wisconsin thompson claimed to cut taxes  times—including eliminating the estate tax in  cutting income tax rates three times and a  billion property tax cut in  when thompson made the same claim in  that he never raised taxes he earned a rating of false from politifactwisconsin politifact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during thompsons terms politifact said in its rating thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and on balance he can claim to have reduced taxes but he also raised some specific taxes along the way politifact rated mostly true thompsons claim that wisconsins overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a budget bill in  thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax that would have largely affected the wealthy at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits executive power consolidationedit as governor thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees among the changes consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the wisconsin department of justice and transferred to thompsons appointee at the department of agriculture the wisconsin office of public intervenor had its budget greatly reduced shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the wisconsin department of public instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted the wisconsin supreme court ruled the move unconstitutional thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional his plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional thompson also insisted on keeping good friday as a halfholiday for state workers despite a clear ruling from the seventh circuit earning a rebuke from the court tobaccoedit as governor thompson was friendly to tobacco interests his campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from philip morris he also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other states in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers abortionedit thompson is catholic and opposes abortion his support for legislation in wisconsin restricting abortions led planned parenthood naral and other prochoice groups to oppose his nomination to head hhs treatment of ojibwa spearfishersedit in  the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit issued its voigt decision which found that wisconsins ojibwa tribe had a treatyguaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing offreservation and that the state of wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on ojibwa land the decision was upheld by the supreme court of the united states in  during his  gubernatorial campaign thompson suggested abrogating the ojibwas rights once in office thompson called on two ojibwa tribes to sell their treatyguaranteed rights the lac du flambeau band of lake superior chippewa for  million and the mole lake band of lake superior chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge

governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont

and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words

judgment upholding the decision of appellee food and drug administration fda the fda decision granted appellees alza corp and janssen pharmaceutica inc both subsidiaries of johnson and johnson collectively alza a sixmonth period of pediatric marketing exclusivity pursuant to  usc § a following expiration of the final patent for alza’s brand name transdermal fentanyl system the duragesic patch which releases fentanyl a narcotic analgesic through the skin to treat chronic pain mylan contends the fda’s final approval of mylan’s abbreviated new drug applications anda to market a generic version of the duragesic patch granted before the fda issued the decision  challenged here entitled mylan to market its generic product immediately upon expiration of the patent pursuant to  usc § j without regard to pediatric exclusivity for the reasons set out below we affirm the district court’s judgment upholding the fda’s decision i this appeal requires that the court consider three separate statutory provisions   usc § j a provision of the  hatch–waxman amendments to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca which authorizes a drug manufacturer to submit an anda to the fda to obtain approval of a generic version of a previously approved drug   usc § a a  amendment to the fdca which authorizes an extra sixmonth ‘‘pediatric exclusivity’’ period following expiration of a drug patent for a patent holder that has satisfactorily conducted pediatric testing of its drug upon the fda’s request and   usc § e a patent statute also enacted in the hatch–waxman amendments which sets out the exclusive remedies available in a patent infringement action we begin with a summary of these three provisions a applicable statutory provisions the anda provision  usc § j creates an ap proval shortcut for applicants seeking to market generic versions of approved drugs under this provision the generic applicant need not conduct its own clinical trials if the anda certifies that the generic version is bioequivalent to an ap proved drug in addition the anda must include one of four statutory ‘‘certifications’’ regarding the approved drug’s patent status i that such patent information has not been filed ii that such patent has expired iii ttt the date on which such patent will expire or  iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted tttt  usc § javiiiiv paragraphs iiv if the anda contains a paragraph iv certification the applicant must within  days of the anda filing send a notice to the patent holder stating it has submitted an anda with the paragraph iv certification and setting out the factual and legal bases for believing the patent is invalid or will not be infringed  usc § jb the anda provision also establishes the effective date for approval of the anda depending on the particular certifica tion made if the applicant makes a certification under paragraph i or ii ‘‘the approval may be made effective immediately’’  usc § jbi if the certification is under paragraph iii ‘‘the approval may be made effective on the date certified under paragraph iii’’  usc § jbii if the certification is under paragraph iv ‘‘the approval shall be made effective immediately’’ unless the patent holder files an infringement action in the district court within  days of receiving the notice in which event ‘‘the approval shall be made effective upon the expiration of the thirty month period beginning on the date of the receipt of the notice’’ unless the district court rules on the infringement claim within the month period see  usc § jbiii if the district court issues a ruling during the month stay period the anda approval date is deter mined by the decision of the district court or the appellate court if appealed  if the district court decides within the stay period that the patent is invalid or not infringed ‘‘the approval shall be made effective on’’ the date of entry of judgment or of a settlement order or consent decree  usc § jbiiii if the district court decides the patent is infringed and the judgment is not appealed or is affirmed ‘‘the approval shall be made effective on the date specified by the district court in a court order under section  the pediatric exclusivity provision  usc § a pro vides an incentive for a drug patent holder to conduct pedia tric studies of a drug which the fda believes may have beneficial pediatric use under the statute the fda must first request that the drug patent holder conduct pediatric studies if the requested studies are satisfactorily completed and submitted within the fdaprescribed time frame the patent holder is eligible to receive a sixmonth period of market exclusivity for the drug beyond the patent expiration date  usc § ac the pediatric exclusivity provi sion expressly addresses the effect of a grant of pediatric exclusivity depending on the particular certification included in the anda a if the drug is the subject of– i a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph ii and for which pedia tric studies were submitted prior to the expiration of the patent including any patent extensions or ii a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph iii the period during which an application may not be ap proved under ttt section jb of this title shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires including any patent extensions or b if the drug is the subject of a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under para graph iv and in the patent infringement litigation resulting from the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and would be infringed the period during which an application may not be approved under ea’’ id § jbiiiiibb in turn if the infringe ment judgment is appealed ‘‘the approval shall be made effective on’’ either ‘‘the date on which the court of appeals decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed’’ or ‘‘the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court of appeals stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed’’ id § jbiiiiiaa  ttt section jb of this title shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires including any patent extensions  usc § acab finally  usc §  a patent statute provision author izes the following remedies in a patent infringement action  for an act of infringement described in paragraph — a the court shall order the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed b injunctive relief may be granted against an in fringer to prevent the commercial manufacture use offer to sell or sale within the united states or importation into the united states of an approved drug or veterinary biological product and c damages or other monetary relief may be awarded against an infringer only if there has been commercial manufacture use offer to sell or sale within the united states or importation into the unit ed states of an approved drug or veterinary biological product the remedies prescribed by subparagraphs a b and c are the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in paragraph  if the district court in the patent infringement litigation deter mines the patent is invalid or will not be infringed anda approval is effective upon the date of the court order so stating under  usc § jbiii and the patent holder is entitled to no exclusivity thereafter see eg mova pharm corp v shalala  fd   dc cir    except that a court may award attorney fees under section   usc § e b this proceeding appellee alza owned us patent no  ’ patent for duragesic by its terms the ’ patent expired on july   in july  the fda wrote alza requesting that it perform pediatric studies of duragesic pursuant to  usc § ac alza submitted the requested studies in novem ber  on january   the fda granted alza a sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period meanwhile in october  mylan filed with the fda an anda to market its generic fentanyl transdermal system pursuant to  usc § j with a paragraph iv certifica tion that alza’s ’ patent was invalid or would not be infringed by mylan’s martketing of its generic product as required under  usc § jb on december   mylan sent alza notice of its anda application and certifi cation which alza received on december   on january   the fortysixth day after notice was re ceived alza filed a patent infringement action against my lan in the united states district court for the district of vermont because the action was not brought within the statutory day window following notice receipt there was no automatic month stay and under  usc § jbiii mylan’s anda was to ‘‘be made effective immediately’’ accordingly on november   the fda granted final approval of mylan’s anda on march   the vermont district court issued a decision holding that ‘‘the ’ patent is not invalid’’ and ‘‘mylan’s anda filing for a generic version of duragesic b infringes ttt the ’ patent’’ alza v mylan  f supp d   d vt  the court therefore enjoined mylan from ‘‘making using offering to sell selling within the united states or importing into the united states’’ its generic  fentanyl transdermal system  f supp d at  re garding mylan’s anda approval the court stated simply that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of mylan’s anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’ patent family’’ id mylan appealed the decision to the federal circuit where it remains pending in the meantime both mylan and alza sought a determi nation from the fda on whether mylan could lawfully mar ket its generic fentanyl transdermal system when the ’ patent expired or whether mylan was required to wait until the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period expired in two letters dated june   the fda issued its administrative decision in the first letter letter  addressed to counsel for both parties the fda concluded that ‘‘alza’s pediatric exclusivi ty for fentanyl will attach and thus delay effective approval of mylan’s anda’’ so that ‘‘unless mylan were to win its patent case on appeal mylan’s anda would be eligible for final effective approval no earlier than six months after the ’ patent expires on july  ’’ letter  at  the fda rested its decision on two key determinations first the fda concluded that the vermont district court’s order that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of mylan’s anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’ patent family’’  f supp d at  trans formed mylan’s anda approval into ‘‘an approval with a delayed effective date’’ which ‘‘is a tentative approval that cannot be made effective until fda issues a letter granting final effective approval’’ letter  at  citing  cfr § bv barr labs v thompson  f supp d   ddc   this regulation provides in order for an approval to be made effective under paragraph b of this section the applicant must receive an approval letter from the agency indicating that the application has received final approval tentative approval of an application  second the fda concluded that when alza’s patent expired mylan’s paragraph iv certification would no longer be accurate and mylan would be required to amend it or ‘‘if mylan refuses to amend its application to change its certifica tion after the patent expires fda can treat that certification as automatically amended to contain a paragraph ii certifica tion because there is no other proper certification upon expiry’’ letter  at  citing ranbaxy labs v fda  f supp d    ddc  aff’d  fed app  dc cir  then once mylan’s certification converted to paragraph ii ‘‘pediatric exclusivity attaches under acai’’ letter  at  citing ranbaxy  f supp d at   so that ‘‘ ‘the period during which an anda may not be approved ttt shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires’ ’’id quoting  usc § acai in the second letter letter  addressed to mylan only the fda informed mylan that ‘‘in light of the vermont district court’s decision the agency hereby rescinds the final approval of anda – issued on november   and regards anda – as tentatively approved’’ letter  at  the letter again noted that after the vermont district court’s order mylan’s anda approval had ‘‘a delayed effec tive date’’ which by fda regulation constitutes ‘‘tentative’’ rather than ‘‘final’’ approval id citing  cfr  § a accordingly the fda informed mylan ‘‘fi nal approval cannot be granted earlier than the date of a court decision finding the patents invalid not infringed or unenforceable or the expiration date of the patent and any period of pediatric exclusivity granted to the nda holder’’ does not constitute ‘‘approval’’ of an application and cannot absent a final approval letter from the agency result in an effective approval under paragraph b of this section this regulation provides ‘‘an approval becomes effective on the date of the issuance of the approval letter except with regard to an approval under section b of the act with a delayed effective date an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date’’  id at   n noting that mylan’s anda was ‘‘subject to alza’s pediatric exclusivity for fentanyl transdermal sys tem’’ on june   mylan filed this action in the district court seeking a determination that the fda’s ‘‘revocation’’ of mylan’s final anda approval was unlawful and an injunction prohibiting the fda ‘‘from revoking the final approval of mylan’s anda and from applying alza’s pediatric exclu sivity to mylan’s anda’’ mylan v thompson  f supp d   dcc  in a decision filed august   the district court granted summary judgment in the fda’s favor concluding that the agency ‘‘did not improperly revoke or reclassify its final approval of mylan’s anda for a generic version of a fentanyl transdermal system to a tentative ap proval and did not improperly apply alza pediatric exclusiv ity to mylan’s anda’’  f supp d at  mylan appealed the district court’s summary judgment ii ‘‘the court reviews the district court’s summary judgment decision de novo and ‘we may affirm only if ‘‘there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law’’ ’ ’’ trans

‘‘arbitrary capricious an abuse of discre tion or otherwise not in accordance with law’’  usc §  we conclude that the fda’s decision was none of these at issue is the fda’s application of the statutory provisions summarized above ‘‘ordinarily we review an agency’s inter  pretation of a statute it is charged with implementing under the familiar and deferential twopart framework of chevron

us at  other citations omitted we are not persuaded by mylan’s argument and conclude as did the district court that the fda’s decision is entitled to chevron deference ‘‘ ‘the want of’ notice and comment ‘does not decide the case’ ’’ against chevron deference barnhart v walton  us    quoting united states v mead corp  us    ‘‘indeed mead pointed to instances in which the court has applied chevron deference to agency interpretations that did not emerge out of notice andcomment rulemaking’’ id citing united states v mead corp  us at  citing nationsbank of n c na v variable annuity life ins co  us    mylan also asserts correctly that the court owes no defer ence to the fda’s interpretation of  usc § ea a patent statute provision which the fda is not charged with admin istering see scheduled airlines traffic offices inc v dep’t of defense  fd   dc cir  or of the decision of the vermont district court see american bioscience v thompson  fd   dc cir  neither the statute nor the court decision however presented any ambiguity for the fda to interpret   ‘‘whether a court should give such deference depends in significant part upon the interpretive method used and the nature of the question at issue’’ id citing mead  us at  in barnhardt the court concluded that ‘‘the interstitial nature of the legal question the related expertise of the agency the importance of the question to administration of the statute the complexity of that adminis tration and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period of time all indicate that chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the agency interpretation here at issue’’ id we reach the same conclusion here there is no denying the complexity of the statutory regime under which the fda operates the fda’s expertise or the careful craft of the scheme it devised to reconcile the various statutory provisions further the fda’s decision made no great legal leap but relied in large part on its previous determination of the same or similar issues and on its own regulations see letter  at  citing  cfr § bv barr and ranbaxy letter  at  citing  cfr § a we therefore accord chevron defer ence to the fda’s letter decision here as we have previously done on at least one other occasion see abbott labs v young  fd   dc cir  cert denied  us   reviewing under

is reviewed under skidmore or chevron the district court properly affirmed the fda’s determinationtttt’’  ‘if ‘‘the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue’’ we ask whether the agency’s position rests on a ‘‘permissible construction of the statute’’ ’ ’’ pharm re search  mfrs  fd at – quoting beverly health  rehab servs v nlrb  fd   dc cir  quoting chevron  us at – in applying the fdca provisions to the particular facts here the fda found two ambiguities first application of the various statutory provisions results in conflicting effective dates for mylan’s anda the patent infringement remedy statute  usc § ea directs that the court deciding the infringement action ‘‘shall order the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed’’ which is precisely what the vermont district court did here directing that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of mylan’s anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’ patent family’’  f supp d at  yet under  usc § jbiii approval of the paragraph iv anda was to ‘‘be made effective immediately’’ after the day window closed without an infringement action filed by the patent holder so that the fda was required to and did grant final approval of my lan’s anda immediately effective notwithstanding the pend ing infringement action as a result at the time of the fda letter decision mylan’s anda was subject to two conflicting approval effective dates the date of the fda’s approval decision november   and pursuant to the vermont district court’s order a date ‘‘no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’ patent family’’ ie july   second after the vermont district court’s finding of patent validity mylan’s paragraph iv anda certification was at variance with the legal reality because the ’ patent was then valid and infringed as a matter of law anda’s certifica tion that the ’ patent ‘‘is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted’’ was no longer accurate further  section ac which governs the consequences for pedia tric exclusivity under each of the alternative patent certifica tions provided no mechanism to resolve this discrepancy because at least as construed in the administrative proceed ing this section applies to a paragraph iv certification only if an infringement action has been filed within the day window so as to trigger the –month stay period because the infringement action here was filed outside the day window the fda was left with a statutory gap to fill in deciding the exclusivity issue submitted by mylan and alza the fda was called upon to construe the statutes so as to resolve these two conflicts we conclude the fda did so in a way that reflects a permissible construction of the applicable fdca provisions and therefore satisfies chevron see western coal traffic league v surface transp bd  fd   dc cir  reviewing under chevron agency resolution of ‘‘unanticipated conflict’’ arising from application of statute a conversion of approval from ‘‘final’’ to ‘‘tentative’’ first the fda concluded that as a consequence of the vermont district court’s determination under  usc § ea that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of mylan’s anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’ patent family’’ the fda’s approval of mylan’s anda was no longer ‘‘immediately effective’’—its effective date had changed as the congress had contemplat ed it would under such circumstances when it enacted  usc §  see hr rep no  pt  at   ‘‘in the case where an anda had been approved the order would mandate a change in the effective date’’ the fda  on appeal the appellees argue alternatively that section acb can be read to cover the situation when the action is filed after the day window as well as before obviating the need for certification conversion this may well be a permissible con struction of the provision but it is not the reading the fda applied during the administrative proceeding nor the one before us on review of the fda’s decision  next determined logically enough that the effective date was then ‘‘delayed’’ and therefore ‘‘tentative’’ rather than ‘‘imme diate’’ and ‘‘final’’ under the fda’s own regulation which provides that ‘‘an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date’’  cfr § a see barr labs v thompson  f supp d   ddc  upholding fda determi nation under  cfr § a that anda approval before patent expiration was tentative not final mylan contends the fda lacked authority to revoke my lan’s final anda approval granted on november   because its authority to revoke a final approval is limited to those specific circumstances set out in  usc § e none of which exists here mylan’s characterization of sec tion e is off the mark as the fda indicates in its decision letter  at  n section e simply sets out specific not necessarily exclusive circumstances under which the fda must withdraw any anda approval whether final or otherwise after notice and hearing but the provision does not prohibit the fda from withdrawing approval under other circumstances—or more precisely does not prohibit the fda from changing a final into a tentative approval under circumstances different from those named in section e moreover the patent remedy statute directs that upon a finding of infringement the district court establish a new effective date for approval which is ‘‘not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed’’  usc § ea and the fda was bound under the district court’s order to treat the status of mylan’s anda under the fdca ‘‘the same as that of other andas blocked from final approval by patent or exclusivity rights’’ letter  at  n  we are skeptical whether the parties properly characterize the fda’s action as ‘‘withdrawal’’ or ‘‘revocation’’ of approval it seems to us that mylan’s anda approval was never in fact ‘‘withdrawn’’ or ‘‘revoked’’ but remained continuously in effect based on the fda’s review of the anda described in the november   final approval letter the approval merely underwent a change of  mylan also claims the approval conversion is ‘‘contrary to past agency practice’’ appellants’ br  citing mead john son pharm group v bowen  fd   dc cir  and unimed inc v quigg  fd   fed cir  each cited case however involved not an anda but a new drug application a different animal entirely because the latter is generally not subject to a delayed effective date and each application was subject to an approval letter authorizing immediate marketing without any delayed effective date see mead johnson  fd at  noting applicant could have marketed its product on day of approval by filing required supplemental labeling unimed  fd at  fda letter noting product could not be marketed until it was ‘‘rescheduled’’ by dea simply ‘‘reminded unimed that dea rescheduling was necessary before the drug could be marketed’’ and ‘‘was not a condition on fda approval’’ emphasis original b conversion of paragraph iv to paragraph ii certification the fda next addressed the problem of mylan’s inaccu rate anda certification and resolved it relying on ranbaxy labs v fda  f supp d  ddc  aff’d  fed app  dc cir  the fda concluded that under ranbaxy when the ’ patent expired mylan’s paragraph iv certification would convert to a paragraph ii certification and alza would be entitled to pediatric exclusivity for six months following the expiration the fda reasoned that status or classification from final to tentative after the vermont district court delayed its effective date  nor do we see any force in mylan’s citation to the fda’s  rulemaking in which the fda declined to extend by rule the statutory day window appellants’ br at  quoting  fed reg at  the fda simply explained there that if the window were to be extended which it was not the fda would retain authority during the extension to grant final effective anda approval notwithstanding the patent holder might subsequently file a successful infringement action  once the certification became inaccurate mylan was under a duty to amend its anda to change the certification to paragraph ii see  cfr § aviiici provid ing ‘‘an applicant shall amend a submitted certification if at any time before the effective date of the approval of the application the applicant learns that the submitted certifica tion is no longer accurate’’ and if mylan failed to do so the fda could ‘‘treat that certification as automatically amended to contain a paragraph ii certification’’ letter  at  once the certification changed to paragraph ii—whether de facto or de jure—pediatric exclusivity attached under  usc § acai ‘‘if the drug is the subject of– ttt a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph ii and for which pediatric studies were submitted prior to the expiration of the patent ttt the period during which an application may not be approved under ttt section jb of this title shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires’’ we find the fda’s application of the statutory provisions both reasonable and supported by ranbaxy in ranbaxy the fda also converted an anda classifica tion from a paragraph iv to a paragraph ii certification under similar circumstances the patent holder in ranbaxy filed an infringement action within fortyfive days after re ceiving the required paragraph iv certification notice upon learning the district court would be unable to decide the case before the patent expiration date the parties signed a stipula tion to dismiss the action as of the expiration date the day before expiration the fda informed the anda applicant that its anda would be subject to a sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period for the patented drug there as here  usc § acb did not apply there because there was no finding of a valid patent or infringement and the fda concluded that upon the patent expiry the paragraph iv certification converted to a paragraph ii certification and pediatric exclusivity attached under  usc § acai the district court agreed with the fda’s statutory construction and on appeal we concluded  the district court properly affirmed the fda’s determi nation that under the federal food drug and cosmetic act  usc §  et seq final approval of ranbaxy’s abbreviated new drug applications ‘‘andas’’ did not automatically occur upon the dismissal of the underlying patent litigation the expiration of the patent and the termination of the thirtymonth statutory stay the district court also properly affirmed the fda’s conclu sion that upon the expiration of pfizer’s patent on janu ary   ranbaxy’s ‘‘paragraph iv’’ certifications became invalid and the applicable pediatric exclusivity provision became  usc § aca the provision pertaining to ‘‘paragraph ii’’ certifications id under that provision approval of ranbaxy’s andas is delayed six monthstttt see  usc § aca  fed app at  for the same reasons the district court here acted properly in upholding the fda’s certification conversion mylan contends that one of the fda’s own regulations weighs against this rationale namely  cfr § aviiia which requires that an anda appli cant amend its application to recertify under paragraph iii ‘‘that the patent will expire on a particular date’’ if a finding of validityinfringement is made in a lawsuit that has been filed within the statutory day window mylan asserts the ‘‘necessary implication’’ of this language is that ‘‘if the appli cant is not sued within the fortyfivedayperiod  usc § jbiii requires that approval of an anda shall be ‘effective immediately’ and certifications are no longer rele vant’’ appellants’ br at  mylan reads too much into the regulation that the fda has expressly required recertifica tion when an action is filed within the day window does not ‘‘necessarily’’ mean an applicant need not amend its applica tion to change the patent certification to reflect changed circumstances if the action is not filed within the window to the extent that the cited regulation is relevant here it sup ports the fda’s rationale in requiring a generic drug appli  cant to amend its anda to include an accurate certification mylan also contends the fda’s construction ‘‘would read section acb entirely out of the statute’’ because if it ‘‘does not govern the availability of pediatric exclusivity in cases like this one involving paragraph iv certifications in which infringement is found the statute serves no purpose at all’’ appellants’ br at  not so under the fda’s interpretation section acb applies when—and only when—all three of its express conditions are met ‘‘a certifi cation has been submitted under paragraph iv’’ there is ‘‘patent infringement litigation resulting from the certifica tion’’ and in the litigation ‘‘the court determines that the patent is valid and would be infringed’’ it is only because one of these requirements was missing in ranbaxy a valid patent finding and in this case an infringement action filed within the day window that the fda prevented from applying its reading of section acb was required to fill the statutory gap by deeming the patent certification changed    we affirm the district court’s judgment because the fda’s decision reasonably resolves the ambiguity in applying the relevant statutes to a factual situation not fully foreseen or provided for by the congress when it enacted the statutes or the fda when it promulgated regulations the vermont district court’s finding of patent validity and consequent injunction changed the factual and legal landscape and the agency’s response to the court’s decision is both reasonable and consistent with the statutory language the fda’s  the fda might well have concluded that in this situation too as alza suggested in the administrative proceeding see letter  at  the paragraph iv certification should have changed to a paragraph iii certification immediately upon the district court’s finding of validityinfringement consistent with the directive of  cfr § aviiici that ‘‘an applicant shall amend a submitted certification if at any time before the effective date of the approval of the application the applicant learns that the submit ted certification is no longer accurate’’  solution effects the policies of both the generic anda provi sion by eliminating the need for mylan to conduct clinical trials of its generic product and the pediatric exclusivity provision by granting alza a sixmonth exclusivity period in return for the pediatric studies it performed the adequacy of which mylan does not dispute at the same time it main tains the incentive under  usc § jbiii for a patent holder to promptly file an infringement action when its patent is challenged because if the patent holder fails to do so within fortyfive days it will lose the benefit of the  month stay period and possibly for a time market exclusivity it should rightfully enjoy so ordered  in a case such as this for example if the district court found the patent invalid without the –month stay the anda applicant would obtain immediate approval under the court’s decision to market its generic product notwithstanding the patent holder might subsequently successfully appeal the

hunter tommy g thompson on the lam for more than two years thompson did virtually everything he could to become “invisible” leading law enforcement officers on a storybook chase for a man with few financial limitations an abundance of smarts and a dogged determination to leave no paper trails “thompson was smart — perhaps one of the smartest fugitives ever sought by the us marshals” peter tobin us marshal for the southern district of ohio said in a statement announcing his capture thompson tobin said had “almost limitless resources and approximately a ten year head start” and yet tobin noted law enforcement agencies using “all of our resources and ingenuity” still accomplished “what some thought would be near impossible” a photo of thompson released this week us marshals service via european pressphoto agency thompson had been wanted since failing to appear before a judge in  in legal proceedings that stemmed from his headlinemaking discovery of a sunken ship laden with gold thompson had found the treasure in  but investors who helped raise the  million used to locate and excavate the ship said they were excluded from the profits when a warrant was issued for thompson’s arrest in august  he and his longtime administrative assistant and girlfriend alison antekeier disappeared to pull off their life in hiding the couple did everything by the book from what law enforcement officials could tell thompson and antekeier were practiced students of “tradecraft” before they became fugitives they had lived under the radar for six years — that is if living in a florida mansion could be considered a surreptitious lifestyle they paid rent for the multimillion dollar vero beach property in cold sweaty cash that had become damp and moldy after being buried underground according to court documents from  that were unsealed this week thompson kept at least  disposable cellphones — each assigned to a different person or purpose also found in the house were money straps stamped with “” a bank statement bearing one of thompson’s pseudonyms with a balance of  million and a book called “how to be invisible” which details how to evade law enforcement at one point the rental agent arrived at the property and found an unforgettable scene “tommy was in the cabana” the agent vance brinkerhoff told the columbus dispatch “when he came out the only thing he was wearing was a pair of leather shoes black socks and a pair of filthy underwear” by the time a handyman for the property realized who they were — after seeing media coverage of the contentious legal proceedings between thompson and his investors — the couple had already packed up the few belongings they would take with them and hightailed it out of town “they lived like squatters in there” said james kennedy who tipped off agents about what thompson and antekeier had left behind according to the dispatch “there’s nothing living there now but rats and cockroaches and there’s junk everywhere” armed with an enormous amount of money a frightening intellect and a meticulousness that baffled the investigators hunting for him thompson had disappeared he wasn’t seen again until tuesday when he and antekeier were arrested at a hilton hotel in boca raton investigators following the developing trail of dozens of leads began closing in on the couple in the west palm beach area in december they rarely left the hotel — and when they did they primarily moved around town by foot bus and taxi usually though it was antekeier stepping out alone leaving thompson behind during one such outing on tuesday investigators tracked antekeier for hours until she led them back to the hotel where she and thompson had been living for nearly two years in a more than anight suite booked under antekeier’s fake name the two fugitives were arrested without incident thompson agents said did not try to hide his true identity he appeared in a florida court on tuesday and told the magistrate that he intended to fight extradition to ohio — where he faces longdelayed civil and now criminal legal proceedings — because he said an illness he contracted some years ago from a mosquito in south america would be exacerbated by being forced to go to colder climates according to the associated press he is scheduled to appear in court again on wednesday antekeier will appear before the magistrate that same day both thompson and antekeier are being held without bond it is a stunning fall for a man who for most of his life left many who knew him in awe of his intellect ingenuity and determination — all of which helped lead him to the sunken treasure aboard the ss central america this undated drawing shows the us mail ship ss central america which sank in september  library of congress via ap the th century vessel was the stuff of legends known as the ship of gold it was carrying about  tons of gold in its underbelly when it wrecked off the coast of south carolina in  during a hurricane killing more than  and sending a california gold rush fortune to the seafloor then came thompson more than  years later to do what no one else had been able to accomplish “he set out to find the central america in the middle of a whole vast expanse of nothing and found it and did it with relative ease” us marshals agent mark stroh told the associated press it was stroh said “like he was trying to find a set of car keys he misplaced in his house but the house is hundreds of miles of ocean” thompson had raised millions of dollars from investors known as the columbusamerica discovery group and with the help of a device he created called nemo he finally found the gold the columbus monthly wrote in  in just a couple of months nemo found and recovered the central america’s pound ships’ bell proving once and for all that tommy thompson’s group had found the right site then nemo recovered the first few pieces of gold it was that gold two coins and one bar that thompson showed to nearly

its welfare system these reforms were implemented and pioneered before congress and president clinton undertook national reform of the program under his leadership wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost  cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care especially for lowincome working families thompson was called a pioneer for two key initiatives of his governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for medicaid through the federal waiver program thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became secretary of health and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words numbers and even entire sentences from appropriations bills in his first two terms alone he used the lineitem veto  times to cancel a total of  million in spending none of these vetoes were overridden thompsons welfare reform policies were criticized wendell primus of the center on budget and policy priorities suggested that many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare many of wisconsins poor remained well below the federal poverty line in addition slightly more of the states poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before thompsons welfare

never raised taxes in wisconsin thompson claimed to cut taxes  times—including eliminating the estate tax in  cutting income tax rates three times and a  billion property tax cut in  when thompson made the same claim in  that he never raised taxes he earned a rating of false from politifactwisconsin politifact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during thompsons terms politifact said in its rating thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and on balance he can claim to have reduced taxes but he also raised some specific taxes along the way politifact rated mostly true thompsons claim that wisconsins overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a budget bill in  thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax that would have largely affected the wealthy at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits executive power consolidationedit as governor thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees among the changes consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the wisconsin department of justice and transferred to thompsons appointee at the department of agriculture the wisconsin office of public intervenor had its budget greatly reduced shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases thompson effectively

superior chippewa for  million and the mole lake band of lake superior chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the ojibwa since it was violence by nonnative american protesters that was the threatened danger crabb issued an injunction against

speech turn bombastic during public statements and have difficulty thinking on his feet during the  vetting process dole also reportedly remarked on thompsons lack of finesse in their interactions

scareedit early in his term thompson faced an emergency situation with the  anthrax attacks thompson was given poor marks for seeming utterly overtaken by events and issuing early statements that the

the press that would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication thompson offered the media a farfetched suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek thompsons words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted potentially undermining public confidence and as the kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the administration to the public on this issue having had no formal training in medicine or public

to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much

went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a

chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the

overhaul its welfare system these reforms were implemented and pioneered before congress and president clinton undertook national reform of the program under his leadership wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost  cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care especially for lowincome working families thompson was called a pioneer for two key initiatives of his governorship the wisconsin works welfare reform sometimes called w and school vouchers in  thompson pushed for the creation of the countrys first parental schoolchoice program which provided milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice he created the badgercare program designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers dont provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for medicaid through the federal waiver program thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became secretary of health and human servicescitation needed thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto particularly his sweeping lineitem veto powers wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words numbers and even entire sentences from appropriations bills in his first two terms alone he used the lineitem veto  times to cancel a total of  million in spending none of these vetoes were overridden thompsons welfare reform policies were criticized wendell primus of the center on budget and policy priorities suggested that many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare many of wisconsins poor remained well below the federal poverty line in addition slightly more of the states poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before thompsons welfare overhaul the growth of the state budget during thompsons year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the  us senate

through  when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul thompson is a rail enthusiast and was a supporter of mass transit which earned him distrust on the

bragged that he never raised taxes in wisconsin thompson claimed to cut taxes  times—including eliminating the estate tax in  cutting income tax rates three times and a  billion property tax cut in  when thompson made the same claim in  that he never raised taxes he earned a rating of false from politifactwisconsin politifact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during thompsons terms politifact said in its rating thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and on balance he can claim to have reduced taxes but he also raised some specific taxes along the way politifact rated mostly true thompsons claim that wisconsins overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from  to  two of the tax increases that thompson did fight using the wisconsin governors partialveto power were taxes on the states wealthiest residents in a budget bill in  thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax that would have largely affected the wealthy at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits executive power consolidationedit as governor thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees among the changes consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the wisconsin department of justice and transferred to thompsons appointee at the department of agriculture the wisconsin office of public intervenor had its budget greatly reduced shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the wisconsin department of public instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted the wisconsin supreme court ruled the move unconstitutional thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional his plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional thompson also insisted on keeping good friday as a halfholiday for state workers despite a clear ruling from the seventh circuit earning a rebuke from the court tobaccoedit as governor thompson was friendly to tobacco interests his campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from philip morris he also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other states in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers abortionedit thompson

superior chippewa for  million and the mole lake band of lake superior chippewa for  million thompsons administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the voigt decision the state of wisconsin argued that native americans lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing in  federal judge barbara crabb ruled against the thompson administrations legal efforts the judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the ojibwa since it was violence by nonnative american protesters that was the threatened danger crabb issued an injunction against

freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
