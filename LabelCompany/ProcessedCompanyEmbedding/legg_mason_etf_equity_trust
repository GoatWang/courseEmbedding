legg mason is rolling out an etf on bats that targets the emerging market space using the same basic lowvolatility highdividend methodology the firm has introduced in two other funds the legg mason emerging markets low volatility high dividend etf lvhe completes a threefund suite and comes with an expense ratio of  bats global markets is the parent company of etfcom problems to solve “when we come up with equity solutions a lot of times it’s because we see a problem when we came up with the lowvol highdiv series it was really to solve two things one was the challenge of getting income in this market which in the last seven years has been really hard” said mike labella a portfolio manager with legg mason subsidiary qs investors the other problem to be solved was economic anxiety he noted “a lot of our clients really have had to hold on to equities longer than they thought people are living longer return expectations on fixed income are pretty low we just finished this year bull market where bonds rallied for  years and now we’re just sitting at this bottom where yields have nowhere to go but up that means investors have to hold more equity and that comes with a lot of risk” labella added such investors tend to be very sensitive to volatility but in searching for income and holding more equities many people did not focus on the additional risk they were taking on because of that he noted “if they’re in a decumulation phase they easily can draw past their income and right into their principal which can force them into a selllowholdhigh investment strategy which is not exactly a key to succss we call that ‘dollarcost ravaging” labella said index construction lvhe’s underlying index is derived from the msci emerging markets imi index and looks to target the components of that selection universe offering aboveaverage dividend yields and belowaverage earnings volatility and price volatility volatility and dividend yield are also used to adjust the weightings of the individual securities according to the prospectus the earnings volatility evaluation is fairly unique according to labella “we want to make sure that the companies in this portfolio have predictable earnings we want to make sure they have established business models that they’re a bit more mature that they will be able to continue to service that high dividend that they’re paying” he added in keeping with lvhe’s lowvolatility objective the index also hedges away currency risk which labella says is a strategic not a tactical decision and in the interests of quality the index methodology screens out stocks that have not been profitable for the preceding four fiscal quarters in aggregate “there’s an enormous amount of companies out there which over the years have been increasing their dividend but their earnings haven’t been increasing along with it that means their payout ratios have been rising significantly and many of them have risen way over  which means they’re paying out more in dividends than they’re seeing in profitability and earnings we don’t want any of that” labella said componentslvhe’s index also has diversificationbased weighting requirements that limit the influence of any single security country region or sector the prospectus noted ultimately labella says the index includes some  to  names sometimes they aren’t always the names you’d expect labella notes that energy companies are wellknown for their high dividends but points out that the earnings in the energy space crashed a few years ago however their dividends have continued to grow as a result such companies do not tend to make it into the indexes and the us index does not include any energy companies in general labella describes the portfolio as one with a high yield but relatively low market beta as a result it will capture a bit less upside when the markets are rising but offer more protection when markets turn downward he said legg mason rolled out
