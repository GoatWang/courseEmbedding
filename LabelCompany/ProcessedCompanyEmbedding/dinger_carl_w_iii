stock buyback plan and has only purchased approximately  of the authorized buyback given the lack of performance of issuer’s stock over the past five years the group is seeking a sale of the issuer   mfri’s management has to their credit reduced the number of businesses that were not producing positive results unfortunately the small capitalization of mfri the excessive managerial costs the related stock options grants and the regulatory costs have all made this stock sell at or to a large discount to book value price to sales and to several other financial metrics over a long period of time what is left now is a pipe insulation company that also provides leak detection systems the remaining segment is particularly attractive to a large number of companies seeking to fully integrate their pipe operations   the poor performance of the stock is the final reason mfri must be sold the issuer’s stock has significantly lagged every market index imaginable over the past five years consequently the group is seeking an immediate orderly sale of the issuer and will seek support from other shareholders additionally the group is seeking the shareholder list and a board seat to ensure that such a sale occurs in a timely and orderly fashion if a sale is not completed in a timely manner the group intends to present a proposal to the shareholders at large at the next
