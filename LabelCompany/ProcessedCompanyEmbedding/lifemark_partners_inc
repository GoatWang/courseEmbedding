group in the early ’s has evolved into lifemark partners an industry leading marketing and sales organization poised for continued growth it was at the greenbrier resort that security connecticut one of the leading early brokerage industry companies hosted a meeting of their general agents  several of these attendees decided to begin to get together to share ideas for insurance sales and marketing as well as the business side of their fledgling agencies  the first formal meeting of life inc life insurance for everyone was held in pittsburgh pa in june of  and the original member agencies included security house baltimore md life plans ct shaw american louisville ky underwriters brokerage service pittsburgh pa ambassador insurance agency boston ma and imco life services southfield mi membership expanded over the years to a high of  member agencies  and while life inc maintained their study group presence and roots they envisioned business opportunities and growth beyond their original charter  it was in the early ’s as lifemark associates and later lifemark distributors that they embarked on an initiative to provide consulting services to carriers one of which involved a project with united of omaha to assist with their desire to enter the brokerage side of the life insurance business  an additional project was for extensive annuity consulting for geca in seattle  this group understood that there was a major difference between a study group among friends and a successful business venture  as a marketing organization lifemark partners was introduced mid ’s with the goal to develop as a major sales and marketing force within our industry  with mende lerner as the initial chairman becky wingate a former mutual of omaha executive was brought on board to help develop the business side of the organization with headquarters in baltimore md  partners were added in a strategic fashion bringing significant production geographic diversity and market expertise  under the initial leadership the organization developed a stellar reputation  michael flynn malcolm sklar and currently mark rosen followed mende lerner as chairman   when becky wingate moved on to other opportunities lifemark was fortunate to have nancy bosley available to step into the president’s role and help further the organization as a true leader within the industry  lifemark is now ably led by bill shelow a brokerage industry veteran and former life insurance company president members of lifemark are well known leaders within their industry and respective communities and over the years roughly half of the nailba chairman have come from the lifemark ranks lifemark partners inc  products  services home about us membership networking inbox wall import address book photo albums
