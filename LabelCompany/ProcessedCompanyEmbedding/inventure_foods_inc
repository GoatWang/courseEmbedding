finer details involved with potatochip production what they noticed during that time was a perceived void in the marketplace as a result the brothers decided to develop their own snack brand by creating a kettlecooked chip that was thicker than traditional varieties so in  bob’s texas style potato chips was born after only three years the chips became so popular with consumers that the brothers sold the business to a partner moved to arizona and launched the poore brothers brand starting with only a single kettle and one delivery truck they relied on sampling and wordofmouth advertising to grow the business the strategy paid off and in  the company went public with the help of a private investment group soon after the ipo acquisitions started when bob’s texas style potato chips was bought back in  a bluffton indiana facility – the location where tgi friday’s snack foods are produced – was acquired in  and the boulder canyon brand was purchased in  in may  as part of the transition from a regional potato chip producer to a national marketer of snack foods the poore brothers name was replaced with the inventure group to create a corporate identity that more closely
