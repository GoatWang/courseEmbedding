need to know about securities laws to set up an llc if youll be the sole owner of your llc and you dont plan to take investments from outsiders your ownership interest in the llc will not be considered a security and you dont have to concern yourself with these lawsfor coowned llcs however the answer to this question is not so clear a security is an investment in a profitmaking enterprise that is not run by the investor if a person invests in a business with the expectation of making money from the efforts of others that persons investment is generally considered a security under federal and state law conversely when a person will rely on his or her own efforts to make a profit that is he or she will be an active owner of an llc that persons ownership interest in the company will not usually be treated as a securityhow does this apply to you generally if all of the owners will actively manage the llc  which is typical in most small startup llcs  the llc ownership interests will not be considered securities but if one or more of your coowners will not work for the company or play an active role in managing the company  as may be true for llcs that accept investments from friends and family or that are run by a special management group  your llcs ownership interests may be treated as securities by your state and by the federal securities and exchange commission secif your ownership interests are considered securities you must qualify for an exemption from the state and federal securities laws before the initial owners of your llc invest their money if you dont fall within an exemption to the securities laws you must register the sale of your llcs ownership interests with the sec and your statefortunately smaller llcs even those that plan to sell memberships to passive investors usually qualify for securities law exemptions for example sec rules exempt the private sale of securities if all owners reside in one state and all sales are made within the state this is called the intrastate offering exemption another federal exemption covers private offerings a private offering is an unadvertised sale that is limited to a small number of people  or fewer or to those who because of their net worth or income earning capacity can reasonably be expected to be able to take care of themselves in the investment process most states have enacted their own versions of these popular federal exemptionsfor more information about sec exemptions visit the sec website at wwwsecgov a quick way to research your states exemption rules is to go to the home page of your states securities agency which typically posts the states exemptions rules and procedures to find your state securities agency go to your secretary of states websiteif your

or general partnership is the fact that the owners members of the llc are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business normally that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier lender landlord or other creditor that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the llc the members may lose their entire investment in the business but their other assets  car home and personal bank accounts  are safe from the creditors of the business or are they in truth there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability many llc members will find that due to the way the business was operated the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful how personal liability arises a member of an llc can be held personally liable for many different types of claims but they typically arise under four different scenarios claims arising out of an act or omission by the member such as the members own negligence fraud or illegal act claims arising out of a contract particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member claims based on the concept of piercing the veil of the llc liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the llcs operating agreement or the applicable llc statute these claims are not a result of choosing an llc as a form of entity all of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and in fact the exceptions were developed first under corporate law actions of a member every member who actively participates in the business of the llc runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability this is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service if you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone your llc is not going to protect you similarly if you make promises about your product or service that are not true the first claim may be against the llc for breach of contract but if the llc cannot perform or pay damages the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action even if you have an employee who committed the action you may not be out of the woods if you personally hired the employee the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee a special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an llc is failure to pay payroll taxes to the irs to protect these socalled trust fund taxes any person who had the ability to prevent the nonpayment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes the irs applies this provision broadly so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didnt you are probably liable claims based on contract another and probably more common source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability usually by means of a personal guarantee for many small businesses particularly new businesses with no credit history obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible landlords too often insist on a personal guarantee particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as buildouts that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit especially after the business is up and running getting payment terms out of the gate however often requires a personal guarantee even when the creditor isnt seeking a personal guarantee a member of the llc can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role if she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the llc it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the llc full name and should indicate the role of the person who is signing member or manager piercing the veil of the llc even if a member avoids personal guarantees he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as piercing the corporate veil although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice in almost all cases of piercing the veil there is either commingling or diversion of assets some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include inadequate capitalization failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities nonpayment of dividends insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time nonfunctioning of other officers or directors absence of corporate records commingling of funds diversion of assets failure to maintain arms length relationships among related entities whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders a possible benefit of an llc over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities and absence of corporate records have no real counterparts in an llc however as case law develops the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors distributions in violation of law or agreement llc acts typically prohibit an llc from making certain distributions for example the final draft of the revised uniform limited liability company act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution  the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities or  the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the company were to be dissolved wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution a member of a membermanaged limited liability company or manager of a managermanaged limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions in addition a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper is limited liability an illusion although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule the llc offers excellent protection from many types of liabilities for example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud the llc should shield you from personal liability if you sell a product that without your knowledge or fault is defective you should not have personal liability trade creditors who deal with the llc without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment shoring up limited liability there are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the llc business insurance carrying adequate business insurance wont change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence but it can help by providing a source for payment you might also consider a personal umbrella policy avoid personal guarantees not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee in many cases landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided learn to question the request capitalize the business adequately provide adequate capital for the entitys intended purposes and document the capital infusion keep the llc separate from your personal business no matter how small the business is it should have its own bank account dont pay personal expenses from the business account instead write yourself a check called a draw on the llc account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses likewise dont use personal checks to pay llc bills if the llc needs funds make a capital contribution or loan and account for everything act ethically dont attempt to mislead the llcs creditors about the financial condition of the business do not divert assets if the business looks like it is going down dont attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the llc that will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets if you act responsibly and take a few precautions

information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about

code   what is an llc like a corporation a limited liability company or llc is a separate and distinct legal entity  this means that an llc can have its own tax identification number and bank account  the primary advantage of an llc is that its owners have limited liability meaning that under most circumstances the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the llc  for example if an llc is forced into bankruptcy the owners will not be required to pay the llcs debts with their own money  if the assets of the llc are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities the creditors generally cannot look to the owners managers or officers for relief an llc can be taxed either as a passthrough entity like a sole proprietorship or partnership or as a regular corporation  by default an llc is taxed as a passthrough entity where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the llc at their individual tax rates  this is different from a regular c corporation which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders the owners as dividends  when the corporation distributes profits the stockholders also must pay income tax on these dividends  most llc owners choose to have the profits passthrough so that taxes are only paid once on the profits totallegal™ has helped over  million people nationwide make essential personal and
