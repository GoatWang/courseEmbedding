for the case alani golanski esq  law offices of alani golanski brooklyn new york for plaintiffs angela digiglio esq  kirkpatrick  lockhart preston gates ellis llp lex ave new york new york for defendant opinion and order shira a scheindlin district judge i introduction on july   defendant crane co crane removed this asbestosrelated tort action to this court invoking the federal officer removal statute section a of title  of the united states code plaintiffs paul and roslyn levy now move to remand the suit to state court for the reasons set forth below plaintiffs motion is granted ii background on or about april   the levys filed this lawsuit against crane and many other defendants in the supreme court of new york county of new york in november of  paul levy was diagnosed with lung cancer which the levys contend was caused by asbestos exposure the levys claim is based on alleged exposure from asbestoscontaining products or the insulation on equipment manufactured by the numerous named defendants including crane they allege more specifically asbestos exposure during the construction and repair of naval vessels between  and  paul levy lists eight ships that he worked on during this period the uss bennington the uss oriskany the uss constellation the uss independence the uss saratoga the lpd  raleigh the lpd  austin and the lpd  ogden paul levy worked as a pipefitter on those vessels and in the brooklyn navy yard the levys allege that the above information made available on april   in plaintiffs responses to defendants fourth amended standard set of interrogatories interrogatory responses is sufficient to have put crane on notice of the removability of the action — the availability of the federal officer removal statute as a result they argue that the removal is untimely crane contends that this information was insufficient and that crane would have been required to assume or infer additional factual information in order for the interrogatory responses to serve as notice of removability rather crane suggests the supplemental discovery responses which were served june   put crane on notice of removability by alleging far more specific information including that paul levy had worked with crane valves iii applicable law a section b under  usc §  b if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable a notice of removal may be filed within  days after receipt by the defendant through service or otherwise of a copy of an amended pleading motion order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable the second circuit requires that an amended pleading    or other paper from which removability may be ascertained enable the defendant to intelligently ascertain removability from the face of such pleading a pleading enables a defendant to intelligently ascertain removability when it provides the necessary facts to support the removal petition this standard does not require a defendant to look beyond the    pleading for facts giving rise to removability b federal officer removal ordinarily the wellpleaded complaint rule dictates that a defendant may remove an action from state court to federal court only if the case could have been filed in federal court in the first instance thus federal question jurisdiction may be invoked only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint suits against federal officers are an exception to this general rule under the federal officer removal statute suits against federal officers may be removed despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint the federalquestion element is met if the defense depends on federal law the federal officer removal statute provides that the united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office may remove to federal court if the defendant moving for removal is not a federal officer or agency three conditions must be satisfied for removal to be appropriate first the defendant must show that it is a person as that term is used in section a second the defendant must offer a colorable federal defense third it must establish that it was acting under a federal officer which subsumes the existence of a causal connection between the charged conduct and asserted official authority while other removal statutes are interpreted narrowly the supreme court has emphasized that the federal officer removal statute is not narrow or limited indeed the policy favoring removal should not be frustrated by a narrow grudging interpretation of § a nevertheless the supreme court has limited federal officer removal where a defendant claims only that it complied with federal regulations or rules issued by federal regulatory agencies iv discussion the levys have adequately demonstrated that notice was given to crane of the removability of this action on april   and the removal is untimely paul levys interrogatory responses state that he was exposed to asbestos while working as a pipefitter on naval vessels with products manufactured by the defendants these responses were sufficiently specific to put crane on notice first crane satisfies the personhood requirement second the facts provided in the interrogatories give rise to a government contractor defense crane argues that it required an allegation that paul levy worked specifically with crane valves however paul levy stated that he was regularly on a daily basis exposed to asbestos during the construction and repair of naval vessels    between  and     the levys list specific ships on which paul levy worked most significantly the responses further provide that paul levy was exposed to asbestoscontaining pipefitting products and insulation while working on those specific ships and that named defendants manufactured such products and insulation the levys responses provide a list of the products which includes valves these facts are sufficiently particular to apprise crane of which products commissioned by the navy were at issue third crane did not require any information from plaintiff to know that crane co was acting under the direction of the navy    in the design manufacture and sale of its valves for and to the navy crane relies chiefly on barnes v various defendants in re asbestos products liability litigation no vi where the court found that removal was timely defendants removed within thirty days of plaintiffs filing of responses to special interrogatories wherein plaintiff alleged exposure from a product manufactured by defendants however in that case plaintiff had not named specific ships or alleged exposure to a type of product manufactured by defendant in the initial complaint the complaint only stated that the decedent had been exposed to various asbestoscontaining products in several locations including a naval shipyard as such the complaint did not provide a nexus between plaintiffs claims and actions allegedly taken by defendant under the direction of a federal officer here the levys have identified in their interrogatory responses exposure on specific ships during a specific time period and the type of products including valves which were manufactured by the named defendants including crane as such defendant had all the information needed to remove on april   v conclusion for the foregoing reasons cranes notice of removal is untimely the clerk of the court is directed to close this motion docket no  and this matter is remanded to the new york state supreme court for new york county so ordered

open document → save to my library please sign up to read full document text preview paul levy case analysis levy makes an impression even before he’s hired we first must analyze the decision process and execution of beth israel deaconess medical center bidmc to hire paul levy as ceo the hospital was in desperate need of a competent leader who possessed the qualities that would turn around and save the notforprofit company in comparing the situation faced by bidmc with groysberg’s “are leaders portable” article it becomes clear levy possesses many “portable” qualities through the political frame we can see levy has many political ties within the boston area which making him a well respected and recognizable figure the numerous connections he has within the area along with being familiar with boston policies and practices gives him a high level of experience that will be helpful in revitalizing the hospital this can be seen in the initial stages of the hiring process when levy uses his relationship with the attorney general to convey his feelings towards keeping the hospital a notforprofit organization levy’s reign at bidmc as ceo started months before he had even been officially hired to run the company he gave the board of directors three demands that would need to be carried out if he were to be hired  the board would be removed from the day to day operation  the board would be reduced to  members and  he would have to be in the job in the first week of january each of these demands are very effective forms of leadership as seen through the political and symbolic frames he establishes himself as stronghanded leader with the power to be the deciding force in decision making it gives levy the upper hand in the struggle for power with the board even before he is ever offered the position also symbolically this shows all employees and the board of directors he is going to be a powerful leader levy’s demands could have been symbolically taken negatively by employees and the board as arrogant but the risk actually paid off as these strategic demands set the stage for how he would eventually run bidmc a new leader dealing with layoffs with the hunter report calling for  layoffs in order to turn the tide at bimdc levy was put into a very tough position at the start of his term as ceo when he was first asked to discuss the layoffs publically levy had a “eureka” moment which ended up being very helpful in establishing himself as a leader he said the  nurses who were recommended to be laid off would be kept on because bidmc prides itself in providing the highest quality of care symbolically this showed bidmc employees he was already making decisions regarding the strategic overhaul of the company he wasn’t just coming in as a new leader to only implement the consultants’ plan he was going to personally integrate his own decisions to turn around the hospital he also an introductory message which through the human resource frame can be seen as an attempt to be honest with employees about the layoffs while he recognizes bidmc needs to carry out these layoffs he still acknowledges that people and organizations need each other he says bidmc will be left with a group of highly talented people and this tactic hopefully lets the remaining staff know they will be needed and a good relationship will benefit them and the organization levy needs to get everyone remaining after the layoffs to be completely on board with the new plan and does so by releasing the hunter report on the intranet through the human resource frame we can see levy is empowering his employees by giving them information and encouraging autonomy and participation this is a very effective leadership tactic especially after massive layoffs because it helps employees to feel more secure about their job while directly involving them in the new processes by sending out another message in the following week to “lift the spirits” of remaining employees levy show more please sign up to read full document you may also find these documents helpful paul levy essay paul levy’s strong transformational leadership style facilitated beth israel deaconess medical center bidmc from ailing to thriving the organization faced many dire issues including financial crisis poor quality of patient care and low staff morale this grim outlook required a strong transformational leader levy displayed all the characteristics of a powerful and effective leader by embracing intellectual stimulation individual consideration and charisma which enabled him to lead them through the crisis levy was able to inspire the beth israel deaconess medical center staff by clearly presenting the hospitals challenges and seeking out different viewpoints to solve them he was able to intellectually stimulate the employees which served to enlighten and motivate them to save the medical center levy demonstrated this fundamental characteristic very clearly during the first month of his tenure by posting the hunter report to the company intranet the hunter report was an outside consultant’s objective overview of the medical centers financial status by posting it to the website he encouraged intellectual thought about the current state of the bidmc from all levels of the team managements openness was rewarded as over  email responses were received with each being reviewed by senior management and responded to directly by levy he was able to gain   words    pages paul levy essay how would you describe the situation levy inherited at the

a problem with the social classes of people at that time where people belonged to different social groupings and that is why paul decided to bring about the need for togetherness irrespective of the social groupings at that time that paul was writing a letter to the philippians he was a prisoner together with silas who was a core laborer allen  in as much as paul was not an alien to the roman empire he accepted to be imprisoned and to be flogged something that was not acceptable by the romans to the roman citizens but he decided to hide his identity as a native at that time the people at philippians would not accept to do such they would easily reveal their identity to avoid the problems hellerman  at that time paul was trying to introduce the judaism religion that was christianity to the gentiles he never intended to be understood differently by the philippians and that was the reason that made him   words    pages paul research paper wanem bizi this case demonstrates the importance of relationships between organizations in the workplace it is important for a company to build and maintain a positive relationship with its suppliers and customers in order to be successful in the case why is cooperation so hard the owner of the company technologia armando bronaldo faces a challenge in which he believes the relationship between him and his customer aud is overbalanced and more in favor of the customer technologia is a fairly newer company and it supplies sound translation components to other companies that manufacture sound equipment aud is currently accountable for  percent of technologia’s business aud was a big contract for technologia when they first started and bronaldo made sure to accommodate each and every request of the customers however the problem that exists now is that bronaldo and the ceo of aud richards are not in favor of the relationship that exists today it seems as if over the years the relationship between the two companies has drifted apart bronaldo admits that he did go out of his way to please richards when the company first started for business needs now he feels that richards is taking advantage of that fact and is only focusing on his needs and profits throughout the entire relationship of course richards is content with how business is running among the two companies and does not understand the need for change

april   by paul •  comments click to see preview video what would cg jung say about donald trump link to full article the great doctor of the soul and modern day alchemist c gjung was so far ahead of his time that more than half a century after his death he is still barely appreciated jung was a genius who had incredibly deep insight into the nature of the psyche particularly how it informs and gives shape to what plays out in our world i find myself wondering what would jung say about the madness currently playing out in our world if he were alive today i can only imagine jung was of the opinion that “active imagination” a process in which we actively dialogue and have it out with the figures of our unconscious was the most powerful practice he had ever come across for working with—and integrating—the unconscious i find myself wondering what if i were to do active imagination with jung himself…more book release for awakened by darkness filmed at powell’s city of books

we are not by contemplating life before we die but by imagining life after death … more rebirth in an age of polarization link to full article at the present moment our country—and our world—are insanely polarized if humanity is seen as a single macroorganism it is as if there is a primordial dissociation—a split—deep within its very source our species is suffering from what the great doctor of the soul c g jung calls a “sickness of dissociation” which is a state of fragmentation deep within the collective unconscious itself that has seemingly spilled outside of our skulls and has taken the form of collective events playing themselves out en masse on the world stage jung writes “and just as for the individual a time of dissociation is a time for sickness so it is in the life of nations we can hardly deny that ours is a time of dissociation and sickness” and yet everything in our world has at least two sides which is to say that our sickness of dissociation is not solely pathological to quote jung “the sickness of dissociation in our world is at the same time a process of recovery or rather the climax of a period of pregnancy which heralds the throes of birth a time of dissociation … is simultaneously an age of rebirth”…more illuminating dark times link to full article we are truly living in dark times more accurately we are living in times where the darkness is emerging from hiding in the shadows and is becoming visible it is easy and very seductive to become overwhelmed with pessimism despair and depression during these times of darkness which would sadly be to unwittingly feed and collude with the darkness and yet to quote a popular saying on the french left “the hour calls for optimism we’ll save pessimism for better times”… more healing our collective sickness drawing by paul levy in these uncertain crazy polarizing and scary times we live in one thing i think everyone can agree on is this if viewed as a single macroorganism humanity has fallen ill with the ascension of donald trump onto the highest throne of political power on planet earth some of us might feel that the sickness is finally going to be called out illumined and healed while others feel that trump and his administration are themselves the current purveyors lineage holders and embodiments of the sickness either way the fact that humanity is not well—afflicted with some sort of disorder—is something that i think we can all agree upon this might be a good starting point for our inquiry the obvious question what is the nature of this deeper sickness that is pulsing through the veins of humanity in contemplating this very question philosopher john mcmurtry author of the brilliant book the cancer stage of capitalism refers to the “great sickness” that pervades our modern day capitalist system as having all of the hallmark qualities of cancer using a whole systems approach he is pointing out that the diagnosis of cancer precisely maps onto a macroanalysis of our current body politic which is to say that what is happening collectively in our world can be recognized to be a form of cancer click here for short condensed version of article click here for full indepth version of article are we humans terminally insane or just waking up link to full article how does anyone possibly express in words the state of collective madness that humanity has fallen into at this time in our history as if in a hypnotic trance our species is enacting a mass ritual suicide on a global scale rushing as fast as we can towards our own selfdestruction we are destroying the biospheric lifesupport systems of the planet in so many different ways that it is as if we are determined to make this suicide attempt work—using a variety of methods as a perverse insurance policy in case a couple of them don’t do the job what modernday humanity is confronted with to quote the author and trappist monk thomas merton is “a crisis of sanity first of all” in trying to find a way to write about this state of affairs i find myself going “offplanet” imagining what it would look like if some enlightened aliens in their travels throughout the universe came upon our planet observing from a distance they would naturally see all the various living beings who call planet earth home as related members of one larger organism—a single ecosystem—who literally depend upon each other for survival from this vantage point i imagine they would be utterly baffled at why human beings—the seemingly most intelligent species ever to appear on planet earth—are acting out their destructive impulses practically without restraint in every corner of the globe contemplating the state of humanity i imagine these awakened beings wondering “what in the world has gotten into them”…more quantum rainbows link to full article an excerpt from paul’s upcoming book the quantum revelation a modernday spiritual treasure the appearance of a rainbow is made up of the interaction of raindrops sunlight and our consciousness by itself—from its own side—a rainbow has no existence in our universe prior to being observed this is to say that there is no intrinsic independent objective rainbow that exists separate from the observing consciousness being a function of our observation if no one were there observing it there would be no rainbow there is no physical rainbow existing somewhere out there in space the rainbow is only to be found within—and not separate from—the very mind that is observing it the highest buddhist teachings—and now quantum physics—says that our physical universe is similar in this regard to a rainbow…more history in the making at standing rock link to full article every now and then an event happens in our world that captures my imagination touching something really deep within me the native american protests against the dakota access pipeline dapl at standing rock north dakota is just such an event this has the feeling of a truly seminal historic event in which we are all invited to participate the peaceful protests by what are known as the “water protectors” against a multibillion dollar corporation putting an oil pipeline through what the native americans consider sacred land endangering the source of their water—ie of life itself—is a deeply symbolic event with real life consequences in a very real sense the protest is itself a sacred ceremony being performed on the world stage being done on behalf of all of humanity – which is to say all of us…more luciddreaming quantum physics link to full article an excerpt from paul’s upcoming book the quantum revelation a modernday spiritual treasure when quantum physics was first formulated in the early part of the twentieth century it was during a time of great collective asleepness quantum physics’ creationdiscovery can be seen as an inkling of a burgeoning awakening in the collective unconscious expressed through the realm of science the process that quantum physics is articulating regarding how an observerparticipant evokes ie “dreams up” reality is generally unfolding unconsciously in most humans which is to say most of us in the waking dream of life are dreaming nonlucidly a question that naturally arises is what would happen as more of us become increasingly aware of the worldshaping creative power that we are wielding which is to say how would things change as we wake up to our powers of quantum creation how would an amplification of our awareness of our powers of quantum creation affect these very powers as we are more and more consciously using them like quantum physics reflects back to us oftentimes asking the right question is more important than finding the right answer…more the enlightened madness of philip k dick the black iron prison and wetiko link to full article recently i have been delighted to learn that the science fiction author philip k dick henceforth pkd was in his own completely unique and “philip k dickian” way describing wetiko—the psychospiritual disease that afflicts our species—to a t considered to be one of the preeminent scifi writers of his—or any—time pkd had one of the most unique creative unusual and original minds i have ever come across way ahead of his time he was a true visionary and seer possibly even a prophet to say that pkd had an unfettered imagination is an understatement of epic proportions—it is hard to imagine an imagination more unrestrained continually questioning everything he was actually a very subtle thinker whose prime concern was the question “what is reality” though mainly a writer of fiction pkd didn’t consider himself a novelist but rather a “fictionalizing philosopher” by which he meant that his stories—what have been called “his wacky cauldron of science fiction and metaphysics”—were employed as the medium for him to formulate his perceptions in other words his fiction was the way he was trying to figure out what was going on in this crazy world of ours as well as within his own mind as the boundary dissolved between what was real and what wasn’t he even wondered whether he had become a character in one of his own novels in his own words “i’m a protagonist from one of pkd’s books” through his writing pkd tapped into the shamanic powers of language to shape bend and alter consciousness thereby changing our view and experience of reality itself…more writing magic link to full article when we recognize that we live in a magicfilled universe we realize that we don’t have to create magic but rather simply allow the intrinsic magic of the universe to reveal itself if this is indeed the case let’s do an experiment and see if in the joint cooperative venture of writing my job and reading your job this article we can indeed let the inherent magic of the universe shine through our shared endeavor in my career as a writer i have learned that when an article i am working on is birthing itself into form at a certain point the universe itself always seems to step in and “conspire” which literally means “to breathe together” with the article infusing it with an energy that i am not able to supply by my lonesome self…more    when the most awake among us fall asleep  marc gafni his supporters and wetiko link to full article in early  a controversy swirling around a charismatic spiritual teacher with a

has attracted a remarkable number of renowned leaders defending him as well as many major figures condemning him a recent spate of publicity including a  christmas day article in the new york times has brought this situation to evoke the academy award winning movie into the “spotlight” … more the mind parasites of colin wilson fiction or reality link to full article it should get our attention that every person or group of people that have discovered what the native american people called wetiko unanimously consider it to be the most important topic—there’s not even any competition—to understand in our world today in addition to independent researchers like myself many artists have also been creatively and imaginatively expressing the insidious workings of wetiko psychosis in a wide variety of mediums oftentimes creative artists are the canaries in the coalmine of humanity’s psyche presciently giving communicable form to what is emerging within the collective unconscious of our species to use one example colin wilson in “the supernatural metaphysical cult thriller” the mind parasites first published in  is using the fictive power of the literary imagination to give living form to this virus of the mind i am so accustomed to writing about wetiko “nonfictionally” that the idea of approaching it through the madeup medium of fiction ie through creative art that isn’t as “serious” as nonfiction opens up new orders of freedom within my soul wetiko can be likened to a “bug” that hampers the creative imagination—potentially even “killing” it if it’s even possible to talk in such fatalistic terms about imagination—which is to say that it makes sense to use the creative imagination as a way of dealing with its imaginationkilling effects… more paul on on

the best way to understand it is to understand the individual human beings who practice it” quantum physics’ realizations about the nature of elementary particles are a magic mirror reflecting something back to us not just about nature but about our nature it is in this sense that quantum physics becomes indistinguishable from a form of metaphysics to quote erwin schrödinger one of the founding fathers of quantum physics “i consider science an integrating part of our endeavor to answer the one great philosophical question which embraces all others the one that plotinus expressed by his brief who are we and more than that i consider this not only one of the tasks but the task of science the only one that really counts” … more interview on the road to the olympia sync summit quantum physics the physics of dreaming for the last few months all i’ve wanted to do is to read about quantum physics i’ve been studying quantum physics off and on for decades but have never gone as far down the rabbit hole as i have this time it feels like i’ve gone through the looking glass to the point of no return the more i contemplate what quantum physics is telling us the more my mind gets blown into phantasmal traces of nonexistent subatomic particles studying quantum theory is like ingesting a mindaltering timerelease psychedelic taking in what quantum physics is revealing to us about the universe we inhabit is “psychoactivating” beyond belief in that it activates the psyche inspires the imagination and synchronistically dissolves the boundary between mind and matter to say that quantum physics is the greatest scientific discovery of all time is not an exaggeration its profound revelations and implications cannot be overstated in discovering the quantum physics has indisputably encountered consciousness there is simply no avoiding this fact quantum theory demands a radical revisioning of the role that consciousness plays in the unfolding of reality quantum physics is pointing out in unequivocal terms that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked and that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other…more dispelling wetiko book release at powell’s books interview portland television show “tv set” o world project interview homage to the creative spiritposted on october   by

find germs of light and recovery with which as though by enchantment to bring forth asclepius the sunlike healer” the archetype of the wounded healer reveals to us that it is only by being willing to
