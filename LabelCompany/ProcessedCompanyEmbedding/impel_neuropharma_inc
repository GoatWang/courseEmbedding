nervous system cns disorders we have developed a novel drug delivery platform the pod™ technology that administers drug to the deep nasal cavity to improve the biodistribution of many drugs this innovation enables entirely new categories of drugs including biologics to be administered using a costeffective disposable noninvasive intranasal drug delivery device philosophy  the goal at impel is simple we want to develop the next generation of therapeutics for central nervous system cns disorders patients with cns disorders are vastly underserved by current therapeutics and we are working hard to change that our pod™ nasal delivery platform is designed to deliver therapeutics into the deep nasal cavity this form of administration may allow for an improvement in biodistribution and consistency compared to current delivery methods impel neuropharma is striving to use the pod™ system to develop improved drugdevice combination products in underserved patient populations we take a comprehensive approach to development and design considering patient comfort regulatory approval pathways and cost effectiveness treatments currently under development include therapies for alzheimer’s disease migraine and parkinson’s disease join impel how it started impel was founded in seattle by john hoekman phd rodney ho phd and michael hite mba at the university of washington hoekman and ho began researching the pharmacokinetics of drugs delivered to the upper nasal cavity they discovered that targeting the upper nasal cavity could result in greatly improved drug distribution to the brain at the same time hoekman began developing an intranasal device platform that could utilize this pathway and become commercially viable impel was founded in  and spun out of the university of washington in  impel has since developed the pod™ drug delivery platform and become a world leader in the development of nasally administered therapies for cns disorders pod technology  impelneuropharma join impel news  articles contact pod technology impel neuropharma’s pod™ nasal drug delivery platform is designed to deliver drugs to the upper nasal cavity for improved biodistribution by delivering therapeutics to the upper nasal cavity the pod™ nasal delivery platform takes advantage of the vascular rich olfactory region for improved bioavailability and has the potential to target the brain via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves delivery of therapeutically meaningful levels of drugs may allow for development of more effective drugs and expand the range of treatment options available to patients the nasal cavity is a vastly underutilized entry point for therapeutics into the circulation the primary challenge in achieving significant nasal drug delivery is depositing drugs in the deeper regions of the nasal cavity due to the complex architecture of this area drugs delivered with standard nasal devices such as droppers sprays or pumps typically deposit less than  of the compound in the olfactory region and thus do not provide a significant level of nasal delivery to treat cns disorders impel’s pod™ technology results in a large fraction of drug deposition in this region which can lead to direct uptake along the olfactory pathways as well as greater uptake into the vasculature depending on the drug featuresadvantagedevelopment features • consistency • accuracy • unit dose or multidose • liquid and dry powder compatible • no breath coordination required • low cost disposable advantage • rapid for fast acting releif • efficient due to targeted delivery • noninvasive for chronic conditions • handheld easy to use for all populations • self or caregiver administered • er use for unconscious patients development • formulation

the world’s largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and premier academic research institutions as innovators of specialty pharmaceuticals and intranasal drug delivery we seek to harness our expertise in study design execution and analysis with our experience in developing products with an exciting pipeline impel seeks partners for existing programs and new pipeline candidates given impel’s focus collaborations are sought with parties with proven experience in cns drug development and commercialization our current business development priorities include  partnering with companies interested in commercializing our existing pipeline assets  finding partners with clinical stage programs where nasal delivery has clear benefits such as reduced systemic exposure and toxcity noninvasive chronic administration and improved biloavailability in the cns  companies interested in b product development where changing the route of delivery can result in an advantaged new product  working with industry or governmental partners interested in codeveloping rapid acting rescue medications for er paramedic or battlefield use become a partner impel partners impel neuropharma has partnered with the alzheimer’s research center on several different studies we are engaged in multiple preclinical and clinical programs to test the feasibility of pod delivered therapeutics for neurodegenrative disease impel neuropharma is in collaboration with researchers at the salk institute to develop new pod delivered treatments that would modulate the brains stress circuitry to prevent alzheimer’s disease impel neuropharma is working in collaboration with walter reed army institute of research to test several pod delivered traumatic brain injury treatments that are impermeable to the bloodbrain barrier m is a strategic partner with impel to accelerate commercialization and cost effectiveness of the pod technology platform and impel’s growing portfolio of enhanced cns products about impel  impelneuropharma join impel news  articles contact about impel impel neuropharma inc is a seattlebased company developing intranasal drug treatments for central nervous system cns disorders we have developed a novel drug delivery platform the pod™ technology that administers drug to the deep nasal cavity to improve the biodistribution of many drugs this innovation enables entirely new categories of drugs including biologics to be administered using a costeffective disposable noninvasive intranasal drug delivery device philosophy  the goal at impel is simple we want to develop the next generation of therapeutics for central nervous system cns disorders patients with cns disorders are vastly underserved by current therapeutics and we are working hard to change that our pod™ nasal delivery platform is designed to deliver therapeutics into the deep nasal cavity this form of administration may allow for an improvement in biodistribution and consistency compared to current delivery methods impel neuropharma is striving to use the pod™ system to develop improved drugdevice combination products in underserved patient populations we take a comprehensive approach to development and design considering patient comfort regulatory approval pathways and cost effectiveness treatments currently under development include therapies for alzheimer’s disease migraine and parkinson’s disease join impel how it started impel was founded in seattle by john hoekman phd rodney ho phd and michael hite mba at the university of washington hoekman and ho began researching the pharmacokinetics of drugs delivered to the upper nasal cavity they discovered that targeting the upper nasal cavity could result in greatly improved drug distribution to the brain at the same time hoekman began developing an intranasal device platform that could utilize this pathway and become commercially viable impel was founded in  and spun out of the university of washington in  impel has since developed the pod™ drug delivery platform and become a world leader in the development of nasally administered therapies for cns disorders
