heart of princeton nj contact us     a service offered to retirement plan sponsors our history – details   princeton capital management was formed in  to offer to a select client base of high net worth individuals and institutions the successful analytical and investing methods practiced by its founders during their long and wellregarded careers at a number of prestigious institutions drawing upon their expertise in the fundamental analysis of a broad range of securities  from the largest of companies around the world to the youngest and smallest us based companies – the founding partners developed a method of portfolio management that looked beyond the restrictive parameters of investment strategy style labels or benchmark considerations they believed their clients would derive greater benefits from an approach that combined an expansive analytical consideration of companies large small young and mature with disciplined portfolio construction focused on optimizing the balance between risk and return over the past twentyeight years princeton capital management has demonstrated the soundness of this approach by delivering competitive longterm returns across each of our investment strategies   our organization – details   managing investment portfolios is princeton capital management’s only business our resources are focused on fundamental security analysis portfolio construction investment operations and client service – nothing else moreover most members of the investment team serve as both analysts and portfolio managers eliminating the layers and thus the distractions common to firms with separate research and portfolio management staffs we pride ourselves on being an organization of equals this is beneficial to clients as it allows each member of the team the confidence to present an opinion on investment ideas versus deferring to either a group or an individual perceived to have greater authority than others it is our experience that hierarchical organizations and the committees associated with such structures rarely facilitate successful stock investing a group in which respected peers unafraid of the repercussions of honest appraisals surround a designated person with final authority has been a demonstrably winning method of making successful investment decisions princeton capital management has remained an independent ownermanaged firm since its inception and owner assets are invested alongside those of our clients we believe our clients have benefited from the firm’s organizational stability and shared goals   our
