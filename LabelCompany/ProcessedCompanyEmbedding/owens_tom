about owens products print email details hits  history of owens products  owens classic was created  with the invention of the classic fifth wheel hitch and the owens fifth wheel recreational trailer the business evolved into the manufacturing of a variety of commercial trailers using the same fifth wheel concept owens designed the first aluminum running board in the market in  which allowed the fifth wheel customer the ease of unlocking the fifth wheel hitch located in the truck bed in  owens sold the fifth wheel hitch and a few years later also sold its trailer manufacturing plant enabling the company to concentrate on its core business automotive accessories owens is a dominant force in the automotive aftermarket with product lines of plastic fiberglass and aluminum running boards aluminum tool boxes dog boxes garage and trailer accessories as well as its custom made products during november  gary kirtley ii purchased owens products and several internal changes were made the
