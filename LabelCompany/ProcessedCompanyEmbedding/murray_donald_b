died  prewriting prewriting should take  of the time dedicated to the writing process by sonia suqi and megan williams professor emeritus of english at the university of new hampshire awarded the  pulitzer prize for editorial writing his motto nulla dies sine linea ornever a day without a line writing once the student has developed enough ideas it is time to write the first draft this is when writing occurs writing is discovery students need to see what writing looks like when it isseen from the inside as a continuing process in finding your voice you discover your identity at the moment of writing the writer uses the tool of language to discover meanings which exist in his or her experience individuals respond to the basic writing process in different ways and this difference is their voice students dont have to know what theyre going to say or write about they just need to write prewriting involves strategies such as daydreaming brainstorming organizing and activating prior knowledge use the discovery draft let the students write without stopping letting the words flow murray says to let the writing get ahead of the writer the teacher needs to create space for the students to play around with words to let them aim in one direction and hit a target in another according to murray only  of a writers time is taken up by drafting the draft is unfinished and needs revision and a writer may work on multiple drafts during this process rewriting rewriting is a beginning and not an ending it takes time and a critical eye in order to add meaning to a draft the writer needs to see that rewriting is different from editing which is concerned with grammar and conventions rewriting is about evaluation organization and delivery the writer must learn to read critically but constructively to cut what is bad to reveal what is good murray believes that  of writing time should be devoted to the rewriting process writers need to look for information meaning audience form development dimension and voice in their writing teaching writing teachers need to be quiet listen and respond teachers need to encourage failure murray says that the failure is essential because through trying failing trying failing we discover what we have to say murray says process theory murray believes that students need to betaught the process of writing too many teachers focus on the end result which is productstudents need to go through the same three stages of writing prewriting writing and rewriting as published writers do in order to believe it as an authentic experience teachers need to be writers too how can theyteach their students how to write if they dontpractice the craft themselves references major contributions murray is credited with developing discovery theory andprocess theory which includes the stages  prewriting writing rewriting writing is a process in which each person attempts to find the meaning of his life we use language not so much to report what we know but to discover what we know all writing is experimental and what works and what doesnt work can only be discovered by a series of attempts failure is not the goal of writing but it is an essential part of the writing process murrays  qualities of good writing  meaning all writing must add up to something this is the most important elementin good writing

defendantappelleecrossappellant appeals from the united states district court for the eastern district of california before hall wiggins and leavy circuit judges cynthia holcomb hall circuit judge  these appeals arise out of an action under the false claims act fca the relators prosecuted the action on their own after the government declined to intervene  the relators theory of the case is as follows general dynamics gd contracted with the air force af to produce and provide engineering drawings for an elaborate radar system called mutes mutes is a mobile system used to train pilots by simulating the signals of various enemy radar after a period of years the af solicited bids on a competitive basis from other companies who wanted to build mutes the af awarded this followon contract to aydin corporation the drawings gd had supplied to the af proved inadequate for aydin to produce mutes according to its contract and the af was therefore forced to renegotiate the terms of its contract with aydin at a cost of over  million  the relators who are insiders at aydin claim that gd knowingly provided inadequate drawings to the af and that this fraud actually damaged the united states in the amount the af had to pay to alter the terms of the followon contract  the district court held a bench trial to determine whether jurisdiction lay under the fca it found it had jurisdiction the court then held a second bench trial on the merits of the fca claim after finding that gd had not knowingly submitted any false claims to the af the court entered judgment for gd gd as the prevailing party then requested an award of costs the court awarded it approximately twenty percent of its claimed costs the relators appeal the judgment on the merits of their claim and gd cross appeals the district courts conclusion that it had jurisdiction under the fca the relators separately appeal the judgment for costs  the district court had federal question jurisdiction under  usc sec  this court has jurisdiction over the appeal under  usc sec  over the cross appeal under  usc sec  and fedrappp a and over the appeal from the costs judgment under  usc sec  i  in the s gd conceived of mutes multiple threat emitter systems mutes is a complex mobile system that simulates the threat of enemy forces the af uses it to train pilots based on gds idea the af conducted a competitive procurement for the award of a contract to build and produce engineering drawings for mutes gd won this contract and it became effective in february  this contract is generally referred to as   the district court found that  obligated gd to provide a technical data package including engineering drawings so that the af could then use the drawings to procure spare parts the contract further required that some of those drawings meet a set of requirements called level  level  requirements are described in a department of defense document entitled milda although milda does not specify precisely the kind of data to be included on level  drawings it does describe level  drawings as those that would allow a competent manufacturer to reproduce the item based on the drawings  in the following years as a result of normal quality control audits the parties evaluated the drawings and the mutes system as a result of these internal audits gd made changes to its drawings the af however at all times considered gds drawings to be satisfactory under the  contract  in  gd and the af entered a second contract referred to as   required gd to build more mutes and to deliver new copies of the drawings that had been revised as a result of the internal audits gd made approximately  changes to its original drawings  in late  and early  the af initiated an effort to solicit proposals from other contractors to build more mutes although the af intended to award the followon contract on a performance specification basis an af contracting officer ultimately decided to solicit bids on a buildtoprint basis as a part of this solicitation of bids the af warranted that certain of gds drawingswhich would be provided to the winner of the followon contractmet level  specifications the af did not warrant that the drawings were adequate for buildtoprint contracts  in  the af awarded the followon contract to aydin on a buildtoprint basis aydin had difficulty reproducing the mutes systems and was forced to seek permission from the af to alter some of gds drawings moreover many of the aperture cards the af provided to aydin which contained engineering data were illegible due to poor handling and copying by the af the af and aydin therefore contracted for a new set of these aperture cards the aperture card contract  aydins continuing difficulties led in  to a renegotiation of the followon contract in which the af agreed to pay an additional  million in exchange for aydins agreement to continue to produce mutes on a performance specification rather than a buildtoprint basis the relators filed their sealed complaint soon afterward in october   the district court held trial in two phases phase i was a bench trial to determine whether the court had jurisdiction under the fca the court ruled that although the claim would have been barred under the version of the fca in force prior to  because the government had the knowledge forming the basis of the claim the claim was saved by a  amendment which the court applied retrospectively the court ruled that the new provision bars claims only when they are based upon certain public disclosures and that these claims were not based upon any public disclosures within the meaning of the fca the court therefore asserted jurisdiction  phase ii was a bench trial on the merits of the relators claims the court found that the terms of both contracts including the incorporation of the level  specification to be ambiguous and therefore accepted extrinsic evidence regarding the understanding of the parties as to whether the drawings were expected to be error free or suitable for buildtoprint followon contracts it further found that the parties did not expect gds drawings to be error free or suitable for buildtoprint followon contracts and therefore that none of the dd form s or claims for payment constituted false or fraudulent claims it also concluded that even had gd submitted false claims it did not have the scienter required in order for liability to attach  after the entry of judgment gd filed a bill of costs which was eventually referred to a magistrate judge the magistrate judge issued findings and recommendations which the district court reviewed de novo and adopted the district court then awarded gd  in costs ii  on crossappeal gd argues that the district court erred in applying a jurisdictional provision of the  amendments rather than applying the analogous provision from the preamendment act it argues that under the preamendment act the district court lacked jurisdiction over the action whether a provision of the  amendments applies retrospectively to conduct that occurred prior to its enactment is a question of law reviewed de novo united states ex rel anderson v northern telecom inc  fd   th cir although this court reviews the existence of jurisdiction de novo it reviews the factual findings on jurisdictional issues only for clear error united states v northrop corp  fd   n  th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d    prior to the  amendments the fca barred actions brought by relators when the action was based on evidence or information the government had when the action was brought  usc sec b  see also anderson  fd at  the district court here found that the government knew of the evidence forming the basis of the action prior to  thus the qui tam action would have been barred under the pre version of the fca  in  however congress amended the fca among the changes was a change to the jurisdictional provision the old language barring recovery if the government had information before suit was filed was changed to an entirely new scheme in which recovery was barred if the claim was based on public disclosure unless the relator was an original source of the information  anderson  fd at  this new provision states  no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal civil or administrative hearing in a congressional administrative or government accounting office report hearing audit or investigation or from the news media   usc sec ea  the district court ruled that this new provision applied to this case tr of oct   at   after the district court made its decision however the supreme court decided landgraf v usi film products  us   s ct   l ed d   this opinion signalled a significant shift in the manner in which federal courts should analyze questions involving the application of new civil statutes to conduct that has already occurred under landgraf a court must ask whether congress has expressly prescribed the statutes proper reach id at   sct at  when congress has not been so explicit however  the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect ie whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted increase a partys liability for past conduct or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed if the statute would operate retroactively our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result  id  this court has clarified the terminology landgraf employs by using the term retrospective to describe application of a new statute to events that occurred before its enactment and reserving the term retroactive to describe a statute that if applied would attach new legal consequences to conduct or transactions already completed see united states v   fd   n  th cir thus landgraf teaches that courts should not apply retroactive statutes retrospectively absent clear congressional intent landgraf  us at   sct at   this court recently addressed whether to apply section ea retrospectively anderson  fd at  held that the provision does apply to a claim filed after the amendments by a relator who had revealed information to the government after the  amendments became effective but before filing suit thus because the government had the information when the relator filed suit his claim would have been barred under the preamendment version of the fca but not under the postamendment version  the anderson panel however expressly declined to decide whether the section was retroactive id at  instead it focused on the effect of the new statute on the relator whose relevant conductdisclosure of information to the governmentoccurred after the amendments it reasoned that because the relator acted after the amendment and the amendment changed the consequences only of the relators conduct id at  the case did not require the court to decide whether to apply the amendment retrospectively the relators conduct took place after it so benefitted from the new law id  the anderson panel thereby avoided the key inquiry under landgraf because application of the new law to the case at hand did not constitute application to conduct that had occurred prior to  in this case by contrast the government did have the information forming the basis of the claim prior to the enactment of the amendments and there is no relevant postamendment conduct that might allow us to say our application of the new law is prospective only we therefore cannot avoid deciding whether the new provision is retroactive simply by focusing on an event such as disclosure that occurred after the amendments instead we directly face the question whether section ea should apply retrospectively for the following reasons we hold that the new jurisdictional provision does not have retroactive effect and therefore that the district court properly applied it retrospectively  the new jurisdictional provision does not impair any rights gd had when it acted nor did the provision at issue increase gds liability for past conduct or impose new duties this amendment relates to whether a qui tam relator can bring the action not to whether the gd is liable for the underlying fraud see anderson at  the defendant submitted the allegedly false claims before the  amendment became effective but the  amendment did not change the legal consequences of the defendants conduct if the defendant really did submit a fraudulent claim it became liable and remained liable to the government thus the amendment did not alter gds underlying liability it only altered the conditions under which a qui tam relator can bring an action to enforce that liability  gd argues that the amendment has retroactive effect because it altered gds rights by eliminating an absolute defense we reject this argument proof that the government had the information when suit was brought was not an absolute defense under the preamendment fca rather it was simply a jurisdictional defense to an action brought by a qui tam relator as opposed to an action brought directly by the government  additionally the landgraf court in dicta noted that it has regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed  us at   sct at  present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional statutes speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties  id at   sct at  quoting republic natl bank v united states  us    s ct    l ed d   thomas j concurring the provision at issue here fits this paradigm precisely prior to the amendment a court had no authority to hear an fca qui tam claim if the government already had the information forming the basis of the claim after the amendment it did have authority to hear such a claim provided that the claim was not based on a public disclosure the amendment simply did not alter gds underlying obligation not to commit fraud upon the government we therefore affirm the district courts retrospective application of section ea to this case iii  gd argues that even if the  jurisdictional provision applies to this case the action is barred under this new provision because it is based on information that was publicly disclosed in a series of government administrative audits and in an administrative investigation of the condition of gds drawing package  the relevant amendment again reads as follows  no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal civil or administrative hearing in a congressional administrative or government accounting office report hearing audit or investigation or from the news media  usc sec ea   gd argued to the district court that seven different documents constituted public disclosures that triggered the jurisdictional bar the relators counter that none of these documents resulted from an audit conducted by an administrative agency and therefore that they cannot qualify as public disclosures in an administrative audit we hold that none of the alleged disclosures gd presented to the district court triggers the jurisdictional bar  although no published opinion of this court expressly so holds a fair reading of section ea indicates that a district court lacks jurisdiction when   there has been a public disclosure   of allegations or transactions   in a criminal civil or administrative hearing in a congressional administrative or government accounting office report hearing audit or investigation or from the news media   and the relators action is based upon that public disclosure  a survey of cases also suggests that each of these elements must be satisfied in order to trigger the bar  because each of the documents gd claimed trigger the bar fails at least one of the four requirements outlined abovein addition to potentially failing part  because the audits were not conducted by an administrative agencywe need not decide whether as the relators urge an administrative audit can only be conducted by an administrative agency instead we hold that each of the documents fails some other part of the test exhibit   this is an excerpt from the offering documents the af provided to bidders for the followon contract for the production of mutes it states that where the drawings the af provides are inadequate or obsolete the contractor will need to update the design and specifications this caveat does not constitute a disclosure of any allegations or transactions regarding any fraud on the part of gd this exhibit therefore fails to meet requirement  exhibit d  this is a letter from relator lindenthal in his capacity as vice president for contracts for aydin corporation to an af contracting officer it discusses proposed price increases due to defective specifications it makes no mention of gd specifically nor does it allege that the inadequacies stem from any fraud moreover this letter does not constitute a public disclosure it is stamped proprietary to aydin corp exhibit w  these are the minutes of a quarterly report prepared by aydin for the af they reflect the agreements reached between us government and contractor personnel regarding difficulties aydin was having producing mutes these minutes were not publicly disclosed moreover disclosure of problems with the drawings is not tantamount to a disclosure that the producer of those drawings committed fraud in submitting them to the government cf rabushka  fd   th cir the essential elements exposing the transaction as fraudulent must be publicly disclosed exhibit j exhibit a  these are claimed to be factual predicates for two other documents they are internal government documents regarding the approval or disapproval of certain data they are not public and do not allege or reveal the factual predicates of fraud they merely reveal inaccuracies in certain data gd provided to the af exhibit d  this is a letter from the af to aydin requesting that aydin submit a proposal for changing the contract from a buildtoprint contract to a performance contract this letter does not mention any shortcomings of any drawings does not mention gd by name does not suggest that any shortcomings were intentional and appears to be a private rather than public correspondence between the af and aydin exhibit f  this is a letter from the af to aydin requesting aydin to submit a proposed price for modifying the contract due to the inadequacies of the drawings it states the government recognizes that the technical data package provided to your firm for performance under the subject contract is inadequate and contains errors this admission by the af however does not by itself give rise to an inference of fraud on the part of gd in fact it does not even constitute an admission that gds drawings were inadequate when submitted to the af only that they were inadequate for aydins purposes moreover the letter is addressed and presumably was sent to aydin such a letter cannot constitute a public disclosure  we therefore hold that none of the alleged public disclosures triggered the jurisdictional bar and affirm the district courts conclusion that section ea does not bar this action iv  turning to the merits the relators theory at trial was that gd breached its contract with the af and provided drawings that did not meet level  specifications as evidenced by the fact that they were inadequate for the buildtoprint contract awarded to aydin thus gds submission of dd form s and claims for payment for work described in those formsif that work did not in fact meet level  specificationswould constitute false claims central to the merits of this case therefore is the question whether gds drawings satisfied the requirement of contracts  and  that the drawings meet the level  specificationa the district court did not err in admitting extrinsic evidence to determine the parties expectations  contracts  and  both required gd to submit level  engineering drawings level  is defined by a department of defense document entitled military specification drawings engineering and associated lists and labelled milda both contracts incorporate milda by reference  milda states that engineering drawings and associated lists prepared to this level level  shall provide engineering definition sufficiently complete to enable a competent manufacturer to produce and maintain quality control of items  without additional product design effort additional design data or recourse to the original design activity it further establishes that the intended use for level  drawings is to provide engineering data for support of quantity production to permit competitive procurement for items substantially identical to original drawings  nowhere does milda state that level  drawings must be error free or adequate to support a buildtoprint contract thus gd posits it is impossible to determine simply by reference to the contracts and to milda whether the fact that gds drawings were inadequate for the followon contract means that they did not meet the requirements of contracts  and  the district court therefore found that the contract terms regarding what information had to be contained in the drawings are ambiguous and the intent of the parties must accordingly be determined with reference to extrinsic evidence  we agree that extrinsic evidence was properly admitted to flesh out the meaning of level  where  contractual language  is unclear and suggests several speculative interpretations the scope of the language must be read in accordance with the parties contemporaneous construction and extrinsic evidence is admissible to show what the parties intended it to mean lockheed aircraft corp v united states  fd   ctcl citations omitted here the relators claim that language in milda stating that drawings meeting level  specifications should allow a competent manufacturer to build the product without resort to additional engineering unambiguously means the same thing as drawings that are sufficient to support a buildtoprint contract  milda however is not so precise it also states for instance that the numbers and types of engineering drawings selected is predicated on sound engineering judgment as an example the specification states that a level  drawing for a simple device might only require a few detailed drawings whereas level  drawings for a sophisticated system could require hundreds of individual drawings id thus we agree that milda does not unambiguously define the parties expectations regarding the degree of expected accuracy or the suitability for future uses it certainly does not unambiguously state that level  drawings must be suitable for buildtoprint followon contracts we reject the plaintiffs argument that the district court erred in admitting extrinsic evidence regarding the parties expectations  b the district court did not err in concluding that gds drawings met the parties expectations and were therefore not the basis of any false claims  based on testimony and documentary evidence the district court found that the af did not intend its contracts to require gd to provide drawings that could be used for followon contracts on a buildtoprint basis rather the af intended to procure from general dynamics level  drawings only for general dynamicsbuilt equipment the court also concluded that drawings adequate to satisfy the level  requirements of general dynamics mutes contracts are not necessarily adequate to support a buildtoprint followon contract with a different contractor and that general dynamics drawings met the level  requirements of its mutes contracts we review the district courts findings based on the extrinsic evidence for clear error and the principles of law applied to those facts de novo stephens v city of vista  fd   th cir  none of these findings is clearly erroneous one af officer for instance testified in deposition that the governments interest in purchasing the drawings was to support repair and was to support the acquisition of spare parts and that it was generally recognized  that level  data rarely supported buildtoprint another officer when asked whether data for competitive procurement meant data for a buildtoprint contract responded no data for competitive procurement means enough data to sustain a true level of competition which can mean a variety of levels of data  similarly evidence amply supports the conclusion that the drawings satisfied gds contractual obligations to the af for example the af program manager responsible for the mutes program testified in deposition that weve been using those drawings for ten or  years without any difficulty and i stand by the data weve been using the drawings and continued to use those drawings the united states government is very happy with the drawings and were going to continue to be happy with them  we therefore affirm the district courts findings that gds drawings met the afs expectations and satisfied gds contractual obligations logically then any claims for payment based on work that satisfied gds contractual obligations to the af could not have been false or fraudulent within the meaning of the fca we also therefore affirm the district courts conclusion that none of the dd  forms or claims for payment under the mutes contracts contained any false claim for payment or fraudulent statement v  because we conclude that gd did not submit any false claims we need not reach the question whether it submitted false claims knowingly so as to allow liability to attach under the fca the fca imposes liability on any person who  knowingly presents or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment  usc sec a knowing submission of claims that as here are not false or fraudulent obviously does not give rise to liability vi  after entry of judgment gd submitted a bill of costs requesting over  in costs the clerk denied the bill of costs gd moved the district court to review the denial of costs the district court reviewed the denial ordered costs to be awarded and referred the matter to a magistrate judge the magistrate judge disallowed a significant portion of gds bill of costs and recommended an award of  the district court reviewed the magistrate judges findings and recommendations adopted them and entered judgment awarding costs to gd  the relators appeal from the district courts order awarding costs they argue that because the district court had previously declined to award gd attorneys fees and expenses under authority of the fca upon a finding that the relators claim was not frivolous clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment it lacked authority to award costs under rule d the relators also argue that even if the district court did have authority to award costs it abused its discretion in doing so we address these arguments in turn  a the district court had authority to award costs under rule   rule  providesexcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the united states or in these rules costs other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs  fedrcivp d the relators contend that the court lacked authority under rule d because  usc sec  constitutes an express provision regarding costs which displaces the authority the court would otherwise have under rule d  although several subsections of section  do expressly mention costs the subsection governing the relators in this case does not the relevant subsection states  if the government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment   usc sec d emphasis added on its face this subsection does not constitute an express provision regarding costs the word costs is simply absent from this provision  relators however suggest that the term expenses includes costs that this subsection thus is an express provision relating to costs and that the fca therefore only provides for costs to a defendant who prevails against a relator proceeding on his own behalf when the relators claim is clearly vexatious although the question is close we reject this argument because under the fca fees expenses and costs are three distinct categories costs under the fca is not a subset of expenses  section d for instance establishes that when a relator proceeds on his own behalf and prevails he shall receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs  usc sec d emphasis added similarly section g provides that when the government intervenes but does not prevail  usc sec d shall apply section d as does section d distinguishes between fees expenses and costs see  usc sec da a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses in addition to any costs emphasis added the language of these two sections strongly suggests that costs under the fca constitute a category distinct from expenses as a matter of logic a court could not award costs in addition to expenses if costs were merely a subset of expenses  in a nutshell then our analysis is as follows two other subsections of section  distinguish between expenses and costs and suggest that the two categories are discrete section d does so explicitly while section g does so by reference to another statute it would therefore be incongruous to conclude that section d which refers only to fees and expenses constitutes an express provision regarding costs despite that it is silent regarding costs  the relators however invoke as support for their position several authorities that we find unpersuasive first they quote language from united states ex rel kelly v boeing co  fd  th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   which was a constitutional challenge to the qui tam provisions of the fca some language from that opinion would support the position that costs are included in the term expenses and may only be awarded upon a finding of frivolousness or vexatiousness see eg  fd at  the qui tam plaintiff may be liable for costs if the suit is frivolous  fd at  a relator who pursues a frivolous action can be ordered to pay the defendants costs and attorneys fees  this language however is not a holding the appellant in kelly raised no issues regarding costs expenses or fees and this court addressed none the relators argument relies merely on imprecise word choice in dicta the language is simply not binding on this panel in this case  similarly other courts addressing other questions have used language that might give rise to an inference that costs are a subset of expenses see eg crawford fitting co v jt gibbons inc  us    s ct    l ed d   section  enumerates expenses that a federal court may tax as a cost under the discretionary authority found in rule d but see hairline creations inc v kefalas  fd   th cir  costs are not equivalent to expenses but include only such items as court fees and witness fees  these cases are not directly relevant to our inquiry however the question in our case is not whether as a general matter costs are included in expenses rather the question is much more precise under the fca does the category expenses include costs only if it does would section d § provision for fees and expenses constitute an express provision for costs that would displace the discretion to award costs a court would otherwise have under rule d because we conclude that section d does not constitute an express provision regarding costs we hold that the district court did not err in awarding costs under rule   b the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs  the relators also argue that even if the district court had authority to award costs it abused its discretion in doing so this argument is without merit this court recently held  the unsuccessful litigant can overcome this presumption in favor of the award of costs under rule d  only by pointing to some impropriety on the part of the prevailing party that would justify a denial of costs a district court therefore must award costs unless the prevailing party is guilty of some fault misconduct or default worthy of punishment  national info servs v trw inc  fd   th cir amended  fd   the relators list in their brief twelve reasons supporting their assertion that the district court abused its discretion none of these reasons relates to any impropriety or misconduct by gd moreover the district court in a written order considered many of the factors the relators raise on appeal as well as caselaw guiding the decision whether to award costs before ordering that gd should recover its costs finally the magistrate judge whose findings the district court adopted carefully analyzed gds bill of costs and reduced the requested award by over seventyfive percent we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs under rule d vii  we affirm the district courts assertion of jurisdiction no  and affirm the judgment entered in favor of general dynamics no  we also affirm the award of costs no  each party shall bear its own costs on appeal  see  usc sec  et seq  these appeals have been consolidated  according to gd a performance specification contract obligates the contractor to produce a system for the contract price that meets the performance requirements of the contract regardless whether the drawings are perfectly accurate  a buildtoprint contract requires the contractor to build the product precisely according to the technical data package supplied by the governmentand requires the government to pay additional sums every time the contractor has to change a drawing because of an error or omission  when a contractor has finished a portion of work called for in the contract it submits to the af a dd form  which describes the work completed and the amount the af is to pay for that work the af approves the dd form  and returns it to the contractor the contractor then includes the cost reflected in the dd form  in its next claim for payment  we emphasize that our analysis and holding applies only to sec ea the analysis might be different for other provisions of the  amendments such as those that explicitly raise the penalties for submission of false claims compare  usc sec   imposing penalty of  plus two times the actual damages with  usc sec a  imposing penalty between  and  plus three times the actual damages  of course even actions based on public disclosures within the meaning of this section are not barred if the relator is an original source of the information see  usc sec eab in this appeal however the relators do not claim to be original sources and the district court in fact found that they are not tr of oct   at   see united states ex rel rabushka v crane co  fd  th cir holding no bar because information disclosed did not amount to allegation of fraud or fraudulent transaction cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   united states ex rel siller v becton dickinson  co  fd  th cir holding that based upon means derived from discovery filed with a court constitutes civil hearing cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   cooper v blue cross  blue shield of florida inc  fd  th cir holding no bar because general rather than specific allegations were disclosed based on means based in any part on united states ex rel springfield terminal ry co v quinn  fd  dccir holding that only discovery materials that are actually rather than just potentially filed are publicly disclosed allegations or transaction means an allegation of fraud or allegation of the critical elements of fraud united states v northrop corp  fd  th cir holding that information revealed in a criminal indictment based on information provided by the qui tam plaintiff is not publicly disclosed cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   united states ex rel williams v nec corp  fd  th cir holding that section eas list of methods of public disclosure is exclusive administrative audit means issued by an administrative agency united states ex rel hagood v sonoma county water agency  fd  th cir holding that participation in drafting a contract does not amount to an administrative investigation  the district court found that none of the documents met the requirements of sec ea although this court generally reviews factual findings underlying jurisdictional questions for clear error a decision regarding whether a particular document triggers the statutory bar seems best characterized as a mixed question of law and fact we therefore review the district courts conclusions de novo  the fca provides that any person who  knowingly presents or causes to be presented to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval  is liable to the united states government  usc sec a  the extrinsic evidence consisted of testimony from several witnesses from the af and from gd and declarations andor deposition testimony from over  declarantswitnesses  we note that the relators perhaps unintentionally resort to extrinsic evidence to support the contention that the terms are not ambiguous  we generally review a decision to award costs for an abuse of discretion national info servs inc v trw inc  fd   th cir amended  fd   however whether a district court has the authority to award costs after denying fees and expenses under the fca is a question of law we review de novo
