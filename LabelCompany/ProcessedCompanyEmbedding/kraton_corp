kratoncom kraton is the trade name given to a number of high performance elastomers manufactured by kraton polymers nyse kra and used as synthetic replacements for rubber kraton polymers offers many of the properties of natural rubber such as flexibility high traction and sealing abilities but with increased resistance to heat weathering and chemicals it was first made by the chemical division of the shell oil company in the s shell sold its kraton polymers business to private equity firm ripplewood holdings in march  propertiesedit sbs block copolymer in tem kraton polymers are styrenic block copolymer sbc consisting of polystyrene blocks and rubber blocks the rubber blocks consist of polybutadiene polyisoprene or their hydrogenated equivalents the triblock with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked together by a rubber block is the most important polymer structure observed in sbc if the rubber block consist of polybutadiene the corresponding triblock structure is polystyreneblockbutadieneblockstyrene usually abbreviated as sbs kraton d sbs and sis  and their selectively hydrogenated versions kraton g sebs and seps are the major kraton polymer structures the microstructure of sbs consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene as shown in the tem micrograph the picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto mercury from solution and then stained with osmium tetroxide the glass transition temperature tg of the polybutadiene blocks is typically  °c and tg of the polystyrene blocks is  °c so at any temperature between about  °c and  °c kraton sbs will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer if kraton polymers are heated substantially above the tg of the styrenederived blocks that is above about  °c like  °c the physical crosslinks change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast molded or extruded into any desired form on cooling this new form resumes its elastomeric character this is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer tpe the polystyrene blocks form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure and they stabilise the form of the moulded material depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae the hydrogenated kraton polymers named kraton g exhibit improved resistance to temperature processing at – °c is common to oxidation and to uv sebs and seps due to their polyolefinic rubber nature present excellent compatibility with polyolefins and paraffinic oils applicationsedit kraton polymers are always used in blends with various other ingredients like paraffinic oils polyolefins polystyrene bitumen tackifying resins fillers to provide a very large range of enduse products ranging from hot melt adhesives to impact modified transparent polypropylene bins from medical tpe compounds to modified bitumen roofing felts or from oil gel toys including sex toys to elastic attachments in diapers it can make asphalt flexible which is necessary if the asphalt is to be used to coat a surface that is below grade or for highly demanding paving applications like f racing tracks kraton based compounds are also used in nonslip knife handles color matched kraton wheel opening extensions on  amc eagles the earliest commercial components using kraton g thermoplastic rubber in the automobile industry were in  american motors amc used this polymer plastic on the amc eagle for the color matched flexible wheel arch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions some grades of kraton can also be dissolved into hydrocarbon oils to create shear thinning grease type products

kraton is the trade name given to a number of high performance elastomers manufactured by kraton polymers nyse kra and used as synthetic replacements for rubber kraton polymers offers many of the properties of natural rubber such as flexibility high traction and sealing abilities but with increased resistance to heat weathering and chemicals it was first made by the chemical division of the shell oil company in the s shell sold its kraton polymers business to private equity firm ripplewood holdings in march  propertiesedit sbs block copolymer in tem kraton polymers are styrenic block copolymer sbc consisting of polystyrene blocks and rubber blocks the rubber blocks consist of polybutadiene polyisoprene or their hydrogenated equivalents the triblock with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked together by a rubber block is the most important polymer structure observed in sbc if the rubber block consist of polybutadiene the corresponding triblock structure is polystyreneblockbutadieneblockstyrene usually abbreviated as sbs kraton d sbs and sis  and their selectively hydrogenated versions kraton g sebs and seps are the major kraton polymer structures the microstructure of sbs consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene as shown in the tem micrograph the picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto mercury from solution and then stained with osmium tetroxide the glass transition temperature tg of the polybutadiene blocks is typically  °c and tg of the polystyrene blocks is  °c so at any temperature between about  °c and  °c kraton sbs will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer if kraton polymers are heated substantially above the tg of the styrenederived blocks that is above about  °c like  °c the physical crosslinks change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast molded or extruded into any desired form on cooling this new form resumes its elastomeric character this is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer tpe the polystyrene blocks form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure and they stabilise the form of the moulded material depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae
