of product merchandising for grainger about the  billion facilities maintenance distributors product expansion and private label strategieschicagobased grainger continues to add product to its portfolio a longterm strategy to provide onestop shopping for its customers the strategy says seth erickson vice president of product merchandising is driven by customer requests we have found that in mro efficiency is king and the more efficient we can make our customers the more valuable we are to them erickson says in fact he says that as the economy slows distributors and their customers must become more efficient and strategically reduce costs by consolidating purchases we want to be in a position to help them do that he says grainger announced last week it added  products to its  catalog in addition to  new products in existing categories the product expansion includes powertransmission products such as bearings couplings linear motion products and belts raw materials products a new area for grainger including metal and plastic sheet tube and rods rubber sheet and strip and felt discs cord sheet and strip and fleet maintenance products including lift equipment battery chargers and accessories graingers  catalog features more than  facilities maintenance products in  the product line expansion program accounted for  percentage points of revenue growth in the branchbased segment so how does grainger maintain service and knowledge levels while expanding its product lines training programs tie into these product launches erickson says we spend a lot of time preparing our customer service and sales people much of the product is sourced direct from manufacturers but in some cases grainger sources through other distributors for example in fasteners and in raw materials private labelalong with its recent product expansion grainger has launched a new private label tough guy a professional cleaning supplies brand tough guy web site the product category includes products such as degreasers disinfectants foam and lotion soaps and dispensers and polyethylene trash containers were excited about tough guy erickson says we wanted to put together a powerful and recognizable brand and so far its been wellreceived grainger has private labels in most of its product areas which comprise about  of its overall sales here are some of graingers private labels  dayton electric motors heating and ventilation equipment westward hand and power tools condor safety products teel liquid pumps speedaire air compressors air handler air filtration equipment demkote spray paints lumapro task and outdoor lighting erickson says grainger chooses private label offerings that will complement its manufacturer brands either theres a gap or we could improve our offerings by offering more tiers he says … we do private label when its truly going to help our customersgrainger plans to continue looking for opportunities to build out its current private label product lines as well as develop new ones it will depend on customer feedback erickson says  in addition the distributor will continue adding product to its catalog the key is weve listened to our customers erickson says they want to have a broad line of products and we are wellpositioned to do that graingers expanded product offering can be found on the company web site previous   next
