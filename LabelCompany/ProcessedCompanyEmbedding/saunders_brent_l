executive network cultureleadershipmanagement brent saunders bausch  lomb ceo the eyes have it by jp donlon  march   share on facebook tweet on twitter a year ago former scheringplough ceo fred hassan became chairman of rochesterbased bausch  lomb a maker of contact lens products ophthalmic pharmaceuticals and ophthalmic surgical products with its manufacturing and marketing operations sliding the company badly needed a transfusion of new management hassan brought one of his star lieutenants brent l saunders who served as schering’s president of global consumer health care to become chief executive in  the company faced falling sales and multiple lawsuits as a result of an eyecare product that had caused infections in october  bausch went private acquired by privateequity firm warburg pincus both hassan and saunders are experienced pharma turnaround executives hassan whipped pharmacia into shape ultimately selling it to pfizer at scheringplough he turned nasonex into a  billion product before selling the company to merck before schering saunders headed pwc’s compliance advisory practice and earlier was its chief risk officer he managed schering’s acquisition of organon biosciences and headed its consumerhealth business he also oversaw the integration of schering’s merger with merck as a newly minted ceo saunders sees bausch  lomb as an iconic brand ready for transformation the  billion company is best known for its antiinfective eye drops disposable contacts and nutritional supplements for the eye saunders’ strategy is to find operational efficiencies and boost topline growth while filling empty pipelines with innovative products for example it is developing a system for removing cataracts and replacing them with an innovative intraocular lens when he showed up as ceo in march  saunders didn’t go to the tower building that had served as the company’s headquarters for much of its  years but to the optical center housed in an older factory building elsewhere in rochester four weeks later when he did turn up to find his executive office at one bausch  lomb place he said “you know guys this just doesn’t work the them vs us suits vs workers mentality is unacceptable” he put the tower up for sale and moved  executives and the legal and administrative staff to the center where everybody else worked a year later saunders has changed the business model beginning with inverting the classic management pyramid “one thing i learned from fred hassan is that the frontline managers are the most important people in the company i’m the least important it’s our job to make their job easier” when the company launched apple’s ipads internally the sales reps got them first  managers were eliminated reducing the head count to  the number of layers shrank from  to seven while the span of control of direct reports has gone from three to fiveandahalf plants in scotland were eliminated and others in ireland and rochester were consolidated what was once called rd has been renamed dr to emphasize the importance internally of bringing research to deliverable products bl remains the only standalone eye health company research spending as a percent of sales is now in the high single digits–almost as high as merck’s the company had developed a strong reputation for firstclass ocular science but like nearby xerox parc in the s allowed others to bring their ideas to market next saunders expects to push aggressively in markets around the world already twothirds of its revenues come from outside the us while it entered china in  and retains a strong brand there—in many parts of china a contact lens is known as a “bausch”—he feels that the company has ground to make up as a newly minted ceo walking into a company that was somewhat removed from your sector what was the biggest challenge you had to face because it’s a healthcare and a consumerproduct company its lifeline depends on innovation and product flow the thing that was missing when i got there—and it was worse than i initially thought—was that the cupboards were bare on innovation this was astonishing considering we have some wonderful scientists throughout the company we got them together and said we’re going to build a pipeline let’s go through old projects that were discarded let’s go through the landscape technologies that are available to us from licensing and outside sources and rebuild a pipeline i’m happy to say we have now three separate businesses surgical pharmaceutical and what most people know us for our consumer eye business of contact lenses and solutions which remains the biggest but pharmaceuticals is catching up rapidly we now have a pipeline in each of the three businesses and we have at least one transformational innovation project in each pipeline in each business which is a very exciting change what new things are coming along in the pipelines when you look at our three businesses you will see revolutionary change in our surgical business we compete against an pound gorilla in the market called alcon so we need to do things differently we’re not going to outalcon alcon we’re not going to beat them at the same game so we are developing disruptive technologies and ways of providing better solutions for surgeons for their patients for example over the course of the next  to  months we hope to change the way some particular eye procedures or surgeries are delivered to the patients in addition to that we are a cataract company and specialize in intraocular lenses for cataract surgery the replacement lens after you remove the cataract we have a wonderful new material that we found in japan with a company called stanton and for which we got worldwide rights we’re putting great optical designs on this new material and launching it this year in europe and introducing it in the us next year lastly we have a product called crystalens in the us a very good premium iol intraocular lens we are developing a permanent lens for people with astigmatism when you get cataracts your lens gets very cloudy so the surgeon will cut in your eye pull out the old lens and insert a permanent lens back in your eye ours is what’s called an accommodating iol which means it gives you more natural sight so you should be able to see far and near the new stellaris vitreoretinal surgical system debuted in august of  in our pharmaceutical business we’re developing a new class of drugs to treat postop inflammation dry eye and allergies this is a huge unmet medical need and we’re excited that this category is now in phase three now finally in our visioncare business we launched a new solution this year called biotrue the first new entry into the category in five years it’s doing quite well it can be worn a long time without getting dry eye we’re also developing innovative breakthrough designs different ways of thinking about how to design the optic system on a contact lens involving new materials the combination of new materials and new solutions becomesgamechanging before you arrived bausch  lomb suffered a product recall five years ago that gave the company a black eye so to speak like merck with its vioxx one misstep cancels many other good things that may have been done it can take  years to build a wonderful brand and this can be destroyed in one week if you’re not a good steward of the brand the moistureloc situation which happened over five years ago certainly hurt our brand but at the end of the day it’s also something to learn from i’ve been through this at schering where we had fda problems and worked hard to earn trust with consumers patients and with the fda and other regulators for bausch  lomb moistureloc represents the same type of opportunity we’re investing heavily in improving our quality systems of our manufacturing processes and building a better supply chain we’re working very hard now to build trust with our key regulators but we’re confident this is behind us what will bausch  lomb become in five years i’m hoping in five years you’ll think of us as the most innovative company you know it starts with first class customer service and finding solutions to a lot of the unmet medical needs in the eyehealth space from a management perspective we need to create an environment where people feel they are empowered to think about these things as opposed to the politics of bureaucracy we kept the vast majority of the people here because one of the very early advantages the company has is the strength of its people and their commitment to improving eye health what were they lacking before you arrived it was leadership and focus it was a company that had become very inward in its thinking and i think it believed it was there to serve itself what i found was a lot of people who were instantly on board with the vision that i outlined which is that we’re here to service customers and patients and bring our innovations to the market as simple as that sounds it was something that just hadn’t been happening for years the company probably started losing its way  or  years ago and that seems to be a bit of an epidemic in rochester xerox had the pc and kodak had the digital camera and bausch  lomb founded the eye health industry all three from what i know got a little insular at some point it needed fresh thinking
