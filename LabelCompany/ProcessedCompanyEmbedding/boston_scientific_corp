noninvasive treatment – primarily of cardiovascular respiratory neurological digestive urological and pelvic conditions its first major product was an angioplasty balloon for cardiovascular treatments introduced in the lates by  the company had developed more than  medical products marketed in  countries around the world its business structure is built around three sectors cardiovascular rhythm management cardiac management and electrophysiology and medsurg or medical and surgical endoscopy urology pelvic health and neuromodulation – a form of central nervous system treatment boston scientifics northwest technology center  in  revenue was pretty evenly distributed across the three segments and roughly  percent of boston scientific’s revenue was generated in the us in its  annual report the company reported  million in income on  billion in total revenue the first time since  boston scientific had not posted a net loss boston scientific experienced significant financial and litigation issues in the mids that continued to affect its bottom line for most of a decade by the mids the company was believed to have turned a corner through restructuring of the organization and addressing legal claims from individuals and the federal government through a series of high profile settlements by  boston scientific claimed that a doctor used one of its devices every  seconds to treat peripheral artery disease and a patient was treated every  seconds with one of its urology products but boston scientific has recalled some of its products sometimes in what the us food and drug administration fda has categorized as class i recalls these are “situations in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death” boston scientific’s history innovation and acquisitions john abele and pete nicholas founded boston scientific in  with a vision of advancing lowcost less invasive surgical and treatment procedures their early focus made the company a pioneer of medical devices used in angioplasty – the surgical repair of blocked or narrowed blood vessels particularly coronary arteries one of the company’s first devices was a peripheral angioplasty balloon that could be inserted in blood vessels and inflated to expand the vessel and alleviate blockage the device cemented boston scientific as a manufacturer of cardiovascular devices and helped underwrite the company’s growth one of boston scientific’s first devices was the peripheral angioplasty balloon in  boston scientific acquired endotech the company’s biggest competitor in producing accessories for endoscopes in  it acquired stentmaker vantech the acquisitions allowed the company to expand its reach across medical device markets affecting cardiology pulmonary urology and gastroenterology fields the company went public in  and saw continued growth through the decade by  boston scientific had acquired nine additional companies and reported  billion in revenue for the year in  the company acquired advanced bionics which built neuromodulation devices – devices that treat disease by enhancing or suppressing activity in the central nervous system in  the company’s taxus express stent was approved in europe when it received fda approval in  the company already had roughly  units ready to ship in the us in  the boston globe called the stent boston scientific’s “most important product ever” from a business standpoint the taxus express is a stainless steel stent with a polymer coating stents work to expand a narrowed artery or vein but sometimes the vessels will narrow again even after a stent is implanted the taxus system includes a medication built into its design to prevent the blood vessels from renarrowing the drug – paclitaxel – is added to a polymer coating on the stent and is slowly released over about two weeks after the stent is implanted fact the taxus system was only the second device of its kind on the market and an important new product for boston scientific boston scientific closed three plants and laidoff thousands of workers to come up with part of the  million it needed to develop the device the taxus system was only the second device of its kind on the market and an important new product for boston scientific but its roll out was marred by a partial recall of  of the devices to install the stent a catheter is threaded through blood vessels to the point that needs expanding then the stent is pushed through a catheter into place in the narrowed vessel a balloon inside the stent expands enlarging the diameter of the stent to widen the vein or artery normally the balloon deflates and is withdrawn back out the catheter leaving the stent in place but some of the balloons failed to deflate leading to the recall despite the recall the device was a huge success for the company and helped drive up boston scientific’s profits more than fivefold in  boston scientific’s growth slows to a crawl with guidant purchase the taxus express was a gamble that paid off in a big way for boston scientific but another gamble would leave the company reeling for nearly a decade in  boston scientific acquired guidant for  billion the largest acquisition to date guidant produced cardiovascular devices including implantable defibrillators and pacemakers in  the minneapolis star tribune reported that the guidant purchase was a longterm and costly problem for boston scientific business analysts said the company overpaid for guidant partly because of a bidding war with johnson  johnson driving up the price and partly because there was no growth in its market sector in addition executives at guidant hid problems with the company’s defibrillators before the sale according to the minneapolis star tribune the purchase of guidant was a longterm and costly problem for boston scientific faulty capacitors in some of the devices caused their batteries to drain prematurely this could result in patient death if the devices were unable to work properly after the acquisition boston scientific was left to deal with the results and expenses when the problems came to light in  guidant llc pleaded guilty to federal misdemeanor charges of concealing the capacitor problems from the fda and boston scientific paid its  million in criminal fines to the federal government in  boston scientific settled a  billion lawsuit johnson  johnson filed against it over a dispute about how the guidant acquisition turned out johnson  johnson had claimed it had made a deal with guidant to purchase the company but guidant broke its contract when boston scientific made a better offer the case had already cost boston scientific millions in legal fees and the prospect of losing in court had hung over the company’s financial planning for years boston scientific paid  million to its former bidding war rival to settle the lawsuit boston scientific was also saddled with internal revenue service penalties and interest over the guidant purchase in  the company settled a  billion tax dispute with the irs for  million plus interest all to be paid by mid the guidant acquisition marked a turning point in boston scientific’s history even as it was dealing with the mounting expenses from guidant boston scientific was being hit with thousands of product liability lawsuits over boston scientific’s transvaginal mesh tvm boston scientific reported a net profit in only two of the next ten years and went through multiple ceos layoffs and restructurings before appearing to turn a corner in the s resuscitating cardio giant boston scientific the business built on cardiovascular devices in the s needed business cpr by the s following the guidant purchase and the baggage that came with it boston scientific saw its market value plummet  percent product development and acquisitions had been disrupted and management was shaken by rapid turnovers the company went through three ceos in five years before mike mahoney formerly with rival johnson  johnson took the helm in  did you know mike mahoney took the helm of boston scientific in  stabilizing the company and returning it to profitability by  as president chairman and ceo mahoney restructured boston scientific management in an effort to stabilize the company at the same time he saw boston scientific bogged down by expensive legal management and regulatory distractions and sought to return the company’s focus to developing new devices and acquiring new companies – the hallmarks of its former success he also acted quickly to reduce potential litigation costs seeking settlements in a year running legal battle with the irs and johnson  johnson’s  billion lawsuit over the guidant purchase and with nearly  patients suing over tvm as the company recovered financially boston scientific began expansion into chinese and indian markets and acquired more companies with a focus on urology and cardiovascular products boston scientific’s recent acquisitions have been restrained going for smaller companies that can easily fit into its existing market sectors instead of attempting large takeovers and market expansions like the guidant purchase by  boston scientific was not only returning to profitability but was seen by some business analysts as a potential takeover prize itself revolutionary medical devices a boston scientific signature boston scientific has a record of developing revolutionary medical devices in recent years these have included modifications of its traditional products and designing devices that take the place of the drugs used in current medical treatments advances on the taxus drugeluting stent include the promus element plus a platinum and chromium stent with a new generation drug element to prevent renarrowing of blood vessels the company’s eluvia drugeluting vascular stent not yet available in the us was undergoing clinical trials into  boston scientific claims the trials have “unprecedented results” after two years of study the company’s alair bronchial thermoplasty system is billed as “the first and only” nondrug treatment for adults with severe asthma a thin tube is threaded into the patient’s mouth or nose along airways into the lungs an electrode extends heating targeted parts of the airways reducing smooth muscle and limiting the passages’ contractions during an asthma attack boston scientific’s watchman device is placed in a portion of the heart’s top left chamber pictured above the watchman left atrial appendage laa closure device is meant to be an alternative to blood thinners for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation nvaf arterial fibrillation af is the most common kind of irregular heartbeat nvaf is a subcategory of af in which the heart rhythm disturbance happens without certain heart valve diseases a prosthetic heart valve or surgical heart repairs treating these patients with the anticoagulant warfarin can reduce their chance of stroke by  percent but blood thinners come with complications including the risk of uncontrolled bleeding the watchman is a small cagelike device that is placed in the laa – a portion of the heart’s top left chamber called the left atrium the device is inserted through a noninvasive catheter procedure it closes off the appendage where blood clots are likely to form possibly reducing the risk of stroke and allowing the patient to stop taking anticoagulants lawsuits and recalls hurt boston scientific’s bottom line revolutionary medical devices sometimes come with high risks some other boston scientific devices on the cutting edge of technology have also been the subject of recalls and thousands of product liability lawsuits in recent years resulting in billions in lost revenue transvaginal meshes in  boston scientific received fda approval for the first transvaginal mesh tvm marketed in the us the company would recall its protegen tvm just three years later after a study found half of all women implanted with it developed serious health problems from  through  boston scientific annual reports showed more than  billion in litigationrelated charges largely related to transvaginal mesh tvm cases and claims in  and  juries returned four verdicts totaling more than  million in favor of plaintiffs who sued over boston scientific’s tvm in a filing with the securities and exchange commission sec in april  the company announced it would pay roughly  million to resolve  cases by november  the company said it had settled roughly  of the roughly  lawsuits over three versions of its tvm and five versions of transvaginal slings boston scientific’s  annual report said that the company had spent  million in litigation charges for the year which included “primarily amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims” implantable defibrillators in  the year after acquiring guidant boston scientific recalled  implantable heart devices manufactured by its new acquisition the implantable defibrillators and defibrillatorpacemaker combination devices had faulty capacitors this could cause batteries to drain sooner than expected putting patients’ lives at danger heart valve systems in  and  boston scientific recalled several units of its firstgeneration lotus heart valve systems for various problems the  recall followed three patient deaths in europe in  the company again recalled its lotus devices this time due to a manufacturing defect that made some of the devices difficult to implant the recall did not affect those devices already implanted the cumulative recalls raised investor concerns about boston scientific’s ability to crack the market for the product dominated by two competitors – edwards lifesciences and medtronic plc the recall included the new lotus edge devices in europe and caused the company to delay its marketing application for us approval for the edge versions the recall was a financial setback for the company expected to keep the devices off the market for at least half a year in europe and delay marketing the devices in the us for a year the lotus devices had been expected to bring in up to  million in revenue for boston scientific in  before the recall author terry turner terry turner is an emmywinning former television

hospital beds boston scientific marlborough massachusetts ivc filters surgical mesh big pharma’s influence critics contend that big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the us many of these products are involved in product liability litigation some of the companies’ bestselling drugs brought in over a billion in

standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
