openfunds redefining absolute returns in the liquid alternative era  bny mellon prev trump victory investment insights prev the triple transition culture and society regulation and risk transformation redefining absolute returns in the liquid alternative era by svein floden download redefining absolute returns in the liquid alternative era pdf  kb save to library print november  absolute return strategies can meaningfully reshape the risk profile of a portfolio by dampening volatility the past few years have seen a considerable convergence between traditional and alternative asset management driven by fee compression an appetite for a broader client base and regulatory changes several hedge fund firms have entered the mutual fund arena offering modified versions of their flagship strategies to a wider range of investors at the same time traditional asset managers that have long delivered their strategies in mutual fund formats have started to offer more innovative and flexible investment strategies to meet the demand of investors who have concerns over protecting portfolios from downside risks these colliding forces have given birth to new categories of strategies in the mutual fund space collectively referred to as liquid alternatives with varying riskreturn profiles and different approaches to investing the rapid growth of liquid alternatives is evidence in our view that institutional and retail investors alike continue to embrace the concept of accessing alternative strategies in a mutual fund format after all several alternative strategies are compatible with a daily liquid transparent and regulated fund format there are many other alternative strategies however that are not a natural fit limitations in terms of liquidity types of investments and regulatory constraints make some strategies unfit for mutual fund formats nevertheless the number of alternative strategies now being offered in mutual fund formats continues to rise and includes funds with drastically different approaches investment objectives and riskreturn characteristics choosing from the growing list of available strategies can be difficult and ultimately depends on what objective an investor is looking to achieve by incorporating liquid alternatives into a broader portfolio one common objective—and the topic of this paper—is the pursuit of absolute returns the concept of “absolute returns” has traditionally been associated with a diversified approach to alternative investing resulting in low volatility and uncorrelated return streams over time however the term has been misused to describe many different approaches some of which have delivered the low volatility and uncorrelated returns that are intended but many more that do not this has led to a mismatch between investor expectations and the outcomes actually achieved in this paper we look at the evolution of absolute return strategies and their more recent manifestation as a subset of the liquid alternatives universe figure  absolute return strategies can meaningfully reshape the risk profile of a portfolio by dampening volatility—an important characteristic especially during volatile times however investors must maintain a clear understanding of the objectives and limitations of such a strategy not everything labeled “absolute return” can actually deliver that return profile we will discuss key aspects of absolute return investing and attempt to provide thoughtful questions to help investors identify true absolute return strategies absolute returns in the hedge fund era the growth of the hedge fund industry attests to the decadeslong understanding of highnetworth individuals and institutional investors for the need to diversify beyond the traditional  equitybond split alternatives particularly hedge funds have long served a crucial drawdownlimiting role in many institutional portfolios while a diverse investment universe most hedge fund strategies are not meant to solely deliver outsized returns rather their ability to employ flexible investment strategies or techniques—such as shorting or the use of derivatives—means that they can potentially deliver returns with an added goal of capital preservation critical to achieving a true capitalpreservation goal however is diversification within an alternatives allocation single strategies bear the idiosyncratic risks of both the manager and the strategy and are thus with few exceptions unlikely to provide sufficient diversification to generate absolute returns in all market environments within a hedge fund structure this diversified approach and the resulting absolute return profile is often built through a fundoffunds approach which aims to provide diversified alternatives exposure through a single investment albeit at the cost of two layers of fees the value proposition of a diversified alternatives allocation is clearest when downside protection and diversification are needed most figure  shows the performance of the aggregated hedge fund universe compared to the sp ® through the postdotcom bubble recession and subsequent bear market while the sp plummeted from thenalltime highs losing  of its peak value the hfri fund weighted composite index declined less than  from the sp’s peak to trough  this dotcomera performance drove an enormous wave of investment in the hedge fund industry when the global financial crisis gfc hit however the aggregated hedge fund universe was not able to sidestep it as neatly as it had the dotcom bubble as global equity indices plummeted with the sp  index losing over half of its value between  and  the hfri composite index also lost  while sophisticated institutions that had employed hedge funds for their ability to generate uncorrelated riskadjusted returns were on the whole satisfied with the hedge funds’ performance as the value of these investments fell less than half that of global equity markets the losses nevertheless revealed structural concerns that forever reshaped the hedge fund industry besides the higher fees associated with hedge funds these concerns mainly centered around opacity the explosion in demand for hedge funds after the dot com bubble tipped the balance of power firmly in their favor and many managers were able to avoid disclosing even modest holdings information to investors in the wake of the gfc investors became significantly more vocal in their demands for transparency particularly in terms of the funds’ holdings portfolio liquidity when asset managers faced redemption pressures and found limited liquidity in markets they were forced to sell less liquid assets for pennies on the dollar or instituted gates blocking investors’ access to their own capital after the gfc investors increased their awareness of and demand for liquidity regulatory oversight while operational due diligence existed before the gfc it may not have ranked high on the concerns of investors as the fundoffund intermediary model had been intended to capture due diligence requirements the crisis changed this dynamic enormously it was described by one pension consultant as “a bomb going off in the industry”  the emergence of liquid alternatives the need for a solution to these concerns along with the massive surge in demand for liquid capitalpreservationseeking investment products from institutional and retail investors alike helped fuel the growth of “liquid alternatives” these products may be structured within the confines of the investment act of  in the united states or with ucits undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities rules in europe however they are also able to employ many of the flexible investment strategies used by hedge funds such as the use of shorting derivatives and leverage albeit with at far lower levels this gives retail and institutional investors alike a way of accessing certain alternative strategies in regulated and transparent vehicles with ready liquidity —something that was missing from the less liquid opaque hedge fund world where investment performance at times trumped every other concern including liquidity management and transparency to investors this coupling of alternative strategies with regulation and ready liquidity and transparency requirements has caused rapid growth in product offerings in fact the morningstar alternative category has experienced a  growth rate over the past five years ending december   liquid alternatives finding a sweet spot alternatives are not an asset class rather they are a set of diverse strategies that share the common virtue of aiming to deliver differentiated returns from traditional bond and equity investments and thus can be used as a tool to enhance returns or reduce risk these diverse strategies have not only different objectives but also different return drivers and investment characteristics depending on the expected sources of risk and return some alternative strategies may be better suited for a hedge fund structure for example strategies like distressed debt or relative value arbitrage that generate returns derived from an illiquidity premium or are amplified through the use of significant leverage are best executed in a hedge fund structure where they can take advantage of the freedom to apply leverage and exploit the illiquidity premium without concern about offering fund investors the ability to redeem their investment on a daily basis moreover even among strategies that are compatible with a mutual fund structure delivering a true alpha value proposition is not a straightforward process liquid alternatives require a very different approach from that used in managing either a hedge fund or a traditional benchmarkdriven mutual fund with significant operational and liquidity management considerations and risks these considerations require experience both in managing mutual funds and executing complex alternative strategies and an operational infrastructure capable of managing multiple compliance transparency trading and riskmanagement components not every manager has the resources to successfully execute a liquid alternative strategy those that do typically have an institutional heritage and experience managing money for sophisticated investors understanding the various strategies covered by liquid alternatives and the capabilities of different managers helps investors gain a nuanced picture of the landscape but investors also need to have a clear understanding of what they want to get from their allocation in the liquid alternative space with so many different strategies available on the market each behaving differently in the pursuit of different objectives serious diligence must go toward aligning the strategy with the investor’s desired outcome in our view by virtue of the possibility for risk reduction through lower volatility and low correlation to traditional asset classes one particularly good fit between strategy and outcome in this space are liquid alternatives that take an absolute return approach absolute return the term “absolute return” remains vague and often misused with a great deal of confusion as to what the return profile of an absolute return investment strategy should look like and what drivers are actually behind those returns the term is essentially a mission statement leaving any number of asset classes investment strategies or techniques that could be used to fulfill such an objective many funds label themselves absolute return and employ an unconstrained mandate as well as a performance benchmark in excess of the riskfree rate eg  bps in excess of cash while these are common features of absolute return strategies a true absolute return product is one that also seeks to generate positive returns irrespective of the wider market environment with low volatility and minimal correlation with traditional asset classes lack of clarity causes problems for investors on two grounds the wake of the gfc created an explosion in demand for alternatives in general and investment managers sought to capitalize on this by labeling their offerings as “absolute return” regardless of whether or not their products could be fairly described as such the subcategories for these funds have become catchalls and care must be taken in approaching them consider the lipper absolute return category where the funds can range from multistrategy to managed futures longshort equity or even shortbiased funds among a host of others that may rely on directional beta for their returns and thus can have sharper drawdowns with sudden unexpected market movements these funds have come under heavy scrutiny while some of the critiques are fair too often they are leveled at fund performance which has on average lagged major market indices through the recent equity bull market the central question for absolute return funds should not be is this fund going to outperform an index but rather how well will my investment be protected and will returns be correlated with traditional asset classes the same beta exposure that boosts returns in a bull market will be the cause of drawdowns in turbulent market environments so a true absolute return fund behaving as advertised should indeed trail equity indices in a bull market its stated aim should not be relative outperformance but rather delivery of steady gains assessing the performance of an absolute return product is more complex than for a benchmarkoriented equity or fixed income fund but a true absolute return fund seeks to deliver three vital characteristics positive returns over a rolling month period low volatility low correlation to traditional asset classes achieving this outcome requires a rigorous focus on downside protection and risk management with tight constraints on what risks are acceptable in any given market condition attribution analysis for the returns of various funds considering manager skill and market movements—alpha and beta—shows that some of the registered funds currently available that call themselves “absolute return” have delivered healthy returns on a standalone basis but they have done so with relatively high equity market beta if a fund is appreciating because the overall equity market is appreciating then it is likely to also experience drawdowns triggered by unanticipated market declines or corrections while a strong return profile especially through a bull market can be tempting the flip side of products with a high beta is that they will inevitably decline in value if the equity market pulls back yet these are the market conditions against which absolute return funds are meant to protect a directional beta component can sometimes be desirable managers can profit on highconviction trades but because the overall equity market tends to be quite volatile being tethered to that market high equity beta leads to a volatile portfolio—meaning the value of the portfolio can change dramatically over a short period in either direction this makes entry and exit points a critical consideration with significant timing risk one of the distinguishing features of absolute return products on the other hand is that they aim to achieve their investment goals without regard to broad market movements a traditional equity portfolio can be expected to have a wide dispersion an investor who moved to cash immediately before the financial crisis and subsequently reinvested in march  would have done very well but one who invested in november  on the eve of the crisis would have lost over half of the portfolio value and would have remained in the red until midnovember  while some investors can tolerate this level of risk and drawdown many—principally those nearing retirement age—may be simply incapable of stomaching a loss over five years and would be forced to sell and realize a loss prematurely absolute return approaches on the other hand tend to have a tighter distribution of returns with fewer losing periods than either global equities or bonds and with far lower average losses during those periods this means that timing risk is much less of a factor there is also a potential behavioral benefit—assuming no sharp drawdowns investors are less tempted by fear or financial constraints to sell at the worst possible time this helps them stay on course to their financial goals conclusion faced with the volatility that is likely to accompany the end of an unprecedented era of central bank intervention and a decadeslong secular decline in interest rates investors are seeking strategies that can be resilient through volatile market periods that is particularly true for those looking to preserve wealth by aiming to offer positive returns diversification low volatility and low correlation with traditional asset classes absolute return liquid alternatives have the potential to reduce the risk of capital loss from sudden market downturns but because not all liquid alternatives are created equal and the term “absolute return” is not always used accurately investors need to understand the composition of the liquid alternatives space the objectives and limitations of each strategy and what part it can play in delivering the riskreturn profile that they are seeking used properly however absolute return liquid alternatives mark an important stage in the evolution of asset management away from peer group or market measures of performance and toward the imperative of outcomes not all liquid alternatives are the same — five questions to consider with the widely misused application of the term “absolute return” and the diversity of strategies available under the liquid alternatives umbrella investor education becomes an important step in aligning strategy with goals by asking the following five questions we believe investors can better understand how a liquid alternative investment works and whether it can help them achieve their objectives is your strategy suitable for a liquid alternative format not all hedge fund approaches can be implemented in liquid alternative funds given the limitations in liquidity leverage and use of certain instruments are key to determining whether a fund’s underlying strategy is suitable for a liquid format furthermore offering increased liquidity could come at the cost of reduced returns and how a portfolio aims to meet daily redemption requirements is important finally it is also important to know that appropriate processes and procedures are in place to ensure that all regulatory requirements are fulfilled what is the funds benchmark and investment time horizon a strategy’s benchmark gives an indication of the manager’s flexibility liquid alternative managers may manage their funds against different benchmarks some may aim for a positive return or to exceed a cash return over a specified time period while others might aim to outperform relative to a specific index for strategies aiming to outperform cash the manager starts with a blank sheet of paper every investment decision is an active decision the investment time horizon is important as it can affect a manager’s attitude to risk managers who aim to deliver returns over a short time horizon such as rolling month periods will typically have a lower tolerance for risk than those who focus on a longer time horizon what are the characteristics of the returns the fund tries to achieve understanding a manager’s attitude toward volatility capital preservation and correlation with the market is crucial the manager may believe higher volatility or loss of capital in the short term is acceptable in pursuit of a longerterm performance target but this could make their fund unsuitable for some investors the manager’s attitude toward correlations is also important a typical investor might want a fund that is uncorrelated to falling markets but is correlated to rising markets the attitude a fund manager takes to this dichotomy can be instructive some will emphasize a lack of overall correlations over time while others may aim to change a fund’s correlation to markets dynamically how will the fund achieve those returns the manager’s answer to this question can indicate whether they emphasize returns based on manager skill alpha or those driven by markets beta liquid alternative fund managers often speak of “dynamic beta” which is an active decision alpha for the manager to take a view on the market managers will further differentiate themselves according to how they generate returns driven by alpha or beta a helpful supplementary question is what investment freedom—including investment universe and investment techniques— do the managers have for generating returns how likely are they to use these freedoms it can be instructive to ask them for historical minimum and maximum exposures that their fund has taken how is the fund expected to perform in different markets no manager will guarantee future returns but asking this question can offer insight into their portfolio if global equities rise by  does the manager expect to participate in that rise or will the returns of their fund remain completely independent of the market if markets decline what does the manager expect to happen  with a prolonged period of rising interest rates forecast the natural presumption for markets is an equally prolonged period of volatility the number of days on which us treasuries moved by  basis points or more in
