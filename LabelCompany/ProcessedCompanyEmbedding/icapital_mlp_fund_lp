initial public offerings up to  of the fund’s assets may be invested in debt securities rated below investmentgrade commonly known as highyield securities or junk bonds the fund also may also invest in derivatives futures options swaps forward contracts as with any mutual fund it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund the fund is new with a limited operating history upon which to rely in determining whether to invest the fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in a small number of issuers potentially exposing it to greater loss than a more diversified portfolio the fund is treated as a regular corporation or “c” corporation for us federal income tax purposes  accordingly unlike traditional openend mutual funds the fund is subject to us federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations currently a maximum rate of  as well as state and local income taxes the fund will not benefit from current favorable federal income tax rates on longterm capital gains and fund income and losses will not be passed on to shareholders energyrelated companies are subject to specific risks including among others fluctuations in commodity prices and consumer demand substantial government regulation and depletion of reserves smallcap stocks and initial public offerings may be more volatile and less liquid than securities issued by large companies and seasoned issuers highyield bonds involve greater risks of default downgrade or price declines and are more volatile and tend to be less liquid than investmentgrade securities derivatives can increase the fund’s volatility because they can be highly illiquid difficult to unwind or value and subject to risk of counterparty default master limited partnerships “mlps” are publicly traded partnerships listed on a national securities exchange the prices of mlp units may fluctuate abruptly and trading volume may be low making it difficult for the fund to sell its units at a favorable price mlp general partners have the power to take actions that adversely affect the interests of unit holders most mlps do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level but an adverse change in tax laws could result in mlps being treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes which could reduce or eliminate distributions paid by mlps to the fund the fund also may invest in mlps
