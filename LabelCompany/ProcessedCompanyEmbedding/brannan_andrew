supreme court of georgia hall v brannanbrannan v hall nos sa sx     decided november   thurbert e baker atty gen mary beth westmoreland deputy attorney general susan v boleyn patricia b attaway burton senior asst attys gen for appellant thomas h dunn kimberly l sharkey king  spalding william e hoffmann jr thomas c lundin jr christopher c bly hoyt l dennard jr for appellee a jury convicted andrew howard brannan of the murder of kyle dinkheller and sentenced him to death and this court unanimously affirmed on direct appeal  brannan v state  ga   sed     brannan filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on may   which he amended on august     an evidentiary hearing was held on august     the habeas court filed a final order on march     the order clearly vacates brannans death sentence  however it is unclear whether it also vacates brannans conviction   the warden appeals in case no sa and brannan crossappeals in case no sx   for the reasons set forth below we reinstate brannans death sentence and to the extent that it is necessary to do so we also reinstate his convictioni factual backgroundon january   brannan was stopped for driving his truck at  miles per hour by kyle dinkheller a laurens county deputy sheriff   dinkhellers patrol cruiser was equipped with a video recorder and dinkheller was wearing a microphone   the recording shows that brannan exited his truck and addressed dinkheller with relative cordiality   however brannan became angry with dinkheller when he ordered brannan to take his hands out of his pockets   brannan shouted “fuck you goddamn it here i am   shoot my fucking ass”   brannan then began dancing around in the street yelling “here i am here i am ․ shoot me”   when dinkheller placed a call on his radio for assistance brannan yelled “who are you calling motherfucker”   brannan then charged at dinkheller repeatedly as dinkheller ordered him to get back and drew his baton   brannan yelled “fuck you” repeatedly and he then yelled “i am a goddamn vietnam combat veteran”   brannan then began rummaging behind the drivers seat of his truck ignoring dinkhellers orders for him to stop   brannan yelled that he was in fear for his life and dinkheller replied that he was in fear for his own life   brannan took a  caliber carbine rifle from his truck crouched at the door of his truck and pointed the rifle at dinkheller   after dinkheller repeatedly ordered brannan to put the rifle down shots were fired by both men   dinkheller was hit and he attempted to retreat and take cover behind the patrol cruiser   brannan pursued dinkheller firing repeatedly and reloading   brannan was shot once in the abdomen   dinkheller had been shot nine times and had likely lost consciousness when brannan took careful aim said “die fucker” and fired a final shot   brannan then fled in his truck   he was discovered hiding in the woods outside his home and was arrested   he gave statements to gbi agents indicating that he regretted what had happened but that he believed dinkheller had provoked him with an aggressive and disrespectful approachii alleged ineffective assistance of counsel the warden argues in his appeal that the habeas court erred in granting relief based on a number of brannans ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and brannan argues in his crossappeal that the habeas court erred by not granting relief on additional grounds of alleged ineffective assistance   to succeed on an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim brannan must show that his trial counsel rendered constitutionallydeficient performance and that actual prejudice of constitutional proportions resulted  strickland v washington  us  iii  sct   ledd    smith v francis  ga    sed     to show sufficient prejudice brannan must show thatthere is a reasonable probability ie a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome that but for counsels unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different  citsmith  ga at   sed    on appeal we accept the habeas courts findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous  however we apply those facts to the law de novo  head v carr  ga    sed     for the reasons set forth below we conclude as a matter of law that the absence of counsels deficiencies would not in reasonable probability have changed the outcome in brannans case   see schofield v holsey  ga   n   sed   holding that the combined effect of trial counsels professional deficiencies should be considered  lajara v state  ga    sed   holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim can be decided based solely on the absence of prejudice of constitutional proportionsa evidence presented at trialbefore discussing the actions that trial counsel allegedly failed to take we first briefly summarize the evidence trial counsel actually presented counsel presented testimony from dr donald harris a psychologist who had conducted a courtordered evaluation of brannan dr harris indicated that brannan had not shown any signs of malingering that brannan had an elevated score on a test for paranoia and that persons found insane at trial are housed in a maximum security area at central state hospitalcounsel presented testimony from dr robert storms a psychologist who had evaluated brannan at counsels request   dr storms testified that brannan hadtwelve or fifteen years of medical history comprised of maybe four or five hundred documented pages of past psychiatric disorders specifically post traumatic stress disorderdr storms detailed brannans military history which included “setting booby traps and ambushes for the viet cong” and the death of one of his commanding officers which occurred under circumstances for which brannan felt responsible   dr storms testified that brannan had a history of manic depression otherwise known as bipolar disorder and that brannans posttraumatic stress disorder had led to the dissolution of his marriage to his inability to work “an established routine” to his becoming a recluse to his living in a remote area in a house with military features to his being declared  percent disabled by the department of veterans affairs to his having intrusive thoughts of vietnam to his having flashbacks to vietnam wherein he had the experience of reliving events from the war to his having severe anxiety and chronic guilt to his feeling in danger for no objective reason and to his being hospitalized   dr storms concluded that brannan was not malingering that he had committed the murder while in a flashback and that he did not have the mental capacity to distinguish right and wrong during the murder   dr storms also testified that brannan was likely in a hypomanic state a state of arousal just below a manic state at the time of the murdercounsel presented testimony from dr avrum weiss a psychologist on the subject of posttraumatic stress disorder   dr weiss testified about brannans past exposure to combat and about how persons who experience a flashback “will actually relive a piece of their past traumatic experience”   dr weiss testified that he had concluded from his review of the records from his evaluation of brannan from brannans statements to the gbi and from the video recording of the murder that brannan was in a flashback during the murder   dr weiss also criticized the report of dr gary carter the courtappointed psychiatrist who evaluated brannan claiming that dr carter had incorrectly focused on brannans conduct after the murder and had ignored signs that brannan had experienced a flashback during the murderpursuant to a joint stipulation counsel entered brannans medical records from the department of veterans affairs and his military records into evidencedr gary carter testified that he did not believe brannan had experienced a flashback or was insane during the murder   dr carter explained that brannans actions were better understood as “taunting” and “rage” and that brannan had simply relied on his past training in combat to carry out the murder efficiently   he testified that brannans dancing in the street was similar to behavior brannan had used in the past to diffuse a dangerous encounter with an armed person   he also testified that he did not believe brannan was in a manic or hypomanic state but instead that brannans driving at  miles per hour was a reasonable means of testing a repair on his truck before the warranty expired and that brannans demeanor during the encounter with dinkheller could be better described as “irritability” and “anger”   on crossexamination trial counsel elicited testimony from dr carter showing that brannan had a number of diagnoses of bipolar affective disorder depression and psychotic behavior which contradicted dr carters earlier testimony that brannan was not subject to manic symptoms and his testimony that brannan had no prior diagnoses of pyschosis   counsel also crossexamined dr carter on his testimony that brannans memory of the murder had been sound showing multiple instances where brannan had made statements indicating a fragmented memory which is a symptom of a flashback   counsel also countered dr carters claim that brannan did not truly have posttraumatic stress disorder by showing that dr carters own report made that diagnosisin his opening remarks at the beginning of the sentencing phase after the jury had rejected a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict or a guilty but mentally ill verdict by finding brannan guilty counsel stated the following to the jurywe certainly respect your decision in this case and were going to do nothing in this stage of the proceedings to say anything other than thatcounsel presented testimony from neighbors a family friend and family members ending with testimony from brannans mother   the testimony described brannan as a caring son who had assisted his father in his dying days and who had shown kindness to several widows and a child in the neighborhood   the testimony emphasized the impact that brannans execution would have on his mother who had already lost her firstborn son in an airplane crash her youngest son to suicide and her husband to cancer   counsel also built on the expert mental health testimony from the guiltinnocence phase with lay testimony regarding brannans abnormal behaviors his strange and isolated living conditions and his odd “nervous laughter”   counsels closing in the sentencing phase emphasized brannans alleged mental illness and the fact that the jury could decline to impose a death sentence based on mental illness despite the fact that it had rejected the insanity defense and a guilty but mentally ill verdictb mental health evidence that allegedly should have been presented at trial the habeas court faulted trial counsel for failing to present evidence that brannan had not taken his medications for several weeks prior to the murder   trial counsel testified in the habeas court that he and cocounsel had discussed brannans medications but that brannans failure to obtain his medications on one occasion was due to his having an argument with a man in line at the pharmacy that required the police to come and that brannan had a history of failing to take his medications   under the circumstances we find that trial counsel did not perform deficiently by declining to open up the matter of why brannan had not had his medications  instead counsel reasonably opted simply to note the fact that brannan had not taken his medications by referring to brannans evaluation by dr carter   furthermore brannan was not prejudiced by counsels failure to call dr william boyer who had been brannans psychiatrist before the murder to testify regarding the effects of brannans lack of medication  as dr boyers pretrial testimony shows he believed that the lack of medication would have simply made brannan depressed   in that same vein we note that dr carter the trial courts expert testified in the habeas proceedings that brannans alleged lack of medication would have simply made him more irritable the habeas court found fault in counsels decision not to call dr boyer as a witness on matters other than brannans lack of medication   however counsel testified as followsi was uncomfortable as to what he might testify to on the issues directly relating to insanity i dont know that he would have supported us on that   i also had the sense that perhaps dr boyer was being a little protective of the va and himself and i thought i wouldnt use him   it was sort of evolving thought about whether to use him or notin light of counsels reasonable strategic concerns we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to call dr boyer as a witness   the habeas court further found that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by stating during his opening statement in the guiltinnocence phase that he “believed” that dr boyer would testify but then not calling him as a witness   see anderson v butler  fd   st cir finding ineffective assistance where trial counsel unnecessarily announced his intention to call a certain witness but then failed to do so   pretermitting whether counsel performed deficiently by announcing the likelihood that he would call dr boyer as a witness while his decision on whether to do so was in his own words “evolving” we conclude as a matter of law that trial counsels actions did not prejudice brannans defense to a significant degree particularly in light of the fact that dr boyers evaluation and treatment of brannan was discussed by other expert witnesses the habeas court found that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not emphasizing brannans diagnoses of bipolar disorder   this finding ignores first of all the fact that counsel did present testimony showing brannans history of manic and hypomanic symptoms depression and bipolar disorder   furthermore counsel reasonably chose to focus their efforts largely on showing posttraumatic stress disorder which unlike a showing of bipolar disorder could potentially support both a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict and a guilty but mentally ill verdict and which was more consistently supported by brannans medical records   the record is very clear that counsel prepared thoroughly to present their mental health evidence by interviewing brannan and his mother repeatedly to learn about his personal history obtaining all available medical records obtaining jail records obtaining school records researching mental health information and presenting the expert testimony described above and that their chosen mental health strategy was reasonable brannan argues that counsel failed to present sufficient evidence to explain why he developed posttraumatic stress disorder   brannan argues that counsel failed to adequately research his combat experience  however in light of the testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial we conclude as a matter of law that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels failure to present evidence like the affidavit testimony brannan has presented in the habeas court from other persons who served in vietnam   similarly we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently and that brannans defense was not prejudiced regarding evidence of brannans personal tragedies and his medical history as those things pertain to posttraumatic stress disorder particularly in light of the evidence and argument counsel presented that brannan had a long history of treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder that was related to his war experiences the habeas court found that counsels actions in the guiltinnocence phase forced the jury to reach a guilty verdict once they chose not to select a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict   our review of counsels arguments at trial do not support this finding   furthermore the fact that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity would have barred a death sentence whereas a verdict of guilty but mentally ill would not confirms that counsel acted reasonably in placing a special focus on insanity while still not entirely abandoning the possibility of a verdict of guilty but mentally ill   see lewis v state  ga    sed   holding that “the statute that provides for a verdict of guilty but mentally ill does not preclude a death sentence as the result of such a verdict”   thus we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels conduct regarding the three possible verdicts in the guiltinnocence phase the habeas court found that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to elicit testimony from dr carter regarding whether brannan was guilty but mentally ill   our review of dr carters testimony reveals that trial counsel ably crossexamined dr carter regarding his doubts about brannans alleged mental illness including by confronting dr carter with specific items from brannans medical records showing diagnoses of various forms of mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder and even by pointing out to dr carter that he himself had made a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder   in light of the testimony counsel actually elicited we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently regarding dr carters testimony and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels handling of his testimony the habeas court found that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to rebut the states argument that brannan was malingering   however our review of the trial record reveals that counsel presented testimony from dr harris and dr storms specifically stating that they had evaluated brannan for malingering and had concluded that he had not done so   accordingly we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently regarding malingering and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels handling of the subject the habeas court found that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present additional testimony about brannans idiosyncratic laugh that would appear when he was anxious   our review of the record reveals that the jury was informed in multiple ways during both the guiltinnocence phase and the sentencing phase regarding brannans laugh   accordingly we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to present additional evidence regarding brannans laugh and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels failure to do so the habeas court found that counsel failed to present mental health evidence in the sentencing phase   however as we noted above trial counsel presented lay testimony that supported the expert testimony presented in the guiltinnocence phase along with other testimony about brannans good character   counsel also reminded the jury that the evidence from the guiltinnocence phase carried over to the sentencing phase   see berryhill v state  ga    sed   noting that the jury properly reconsiders all evidence from the guiltinnocence phase in the sentencing phase   accordingly we conclude as a matter of law that trial counsel did not perform deficiently and that brannans defense did not suffer any prejudice from counsels actionsc other instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel the habeas court found that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by stipulating to the admissibility of the portion of the video recording that depicts the murder brannans fleeing and sounds of dinkhellers dying breaths   although the recording is deeply disturbing it was admissible evidence of brannans actions and of the death of the victim   see cohen v state  ga    sed   holding that “the gruesome or inflammatory aspect of the pictorial evidence” which included a video recording “stemmed entirely from the defendants own acts” and was admissible   we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently by not raising a meritless objection to the portion of the video recording admitted at trial and that brannans defense did not suffer prejudice by their failure to do so   see hampton v state  ga  a  sed    fults v state  ga    sed   brannan argues in his crossappeal that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by successfully moving to suppress a portion of his statement to the gbi that contained statements of remorse   however our review of the statements reveals that the unsuppressed portion also contained statements of remorse and that the suppressed portion contained statements partially fixing blame on the sheriffs office and the victim for not following better procedures   under these circumstances we conclude as a matter of law that trial counsel did not perform deficiently by having a portion of the interview suppressed and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels doing so brannan also argues in his crossappeal that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain testimony like testimony he presented in the habeas court showing that the victim fired the first shot and that the victim failed to comply with proper police procedures   counsel testified in the habeas court however that he had believed all along that the victim had fired first but that he saw no need for testimony on that subject because it was clear that the victim being confronted with an armed and belligerent person who refused to put down his assault rifle should have fired first   he also testified that in his judgment the question of who shot first would not affect brannans insanity defense   dr storms the defendants mostimportant expert witness testified that he believed brannan had entered into a flashback while he was rummaging in his truck looking for his rifle long before any shots were fired   furthermore testimony from dr carter the trial courts expert and questions to dr carter by the prosecutor both seemed to assume that the victim had shot first   under these circumstances we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels failure to seek expert testimony regarding who shot first   likewise because the jury very likely would have been offended by an argument that the victim was somehow responsible for his own death because he failed to confront brannan even more aggressively than he did we conclude as a matter of law that counsel did not perform deficiently and that brannans defense was not prejudiced by counsels failure to introduce evidence about proper police procedures like the evidence brannan presented in the habeas courtd collective effect of trial counsels deficienciesconsidering the collective prejudicial effect of all of counsels deficiencies that we have either found or assumed in the discussion above we conclude as a matter of law that the absence of those deficiencies would not in reasonable probability have changed the outcome of either phase of brannans trial   see holsey  ga at  n   sed  holding that the combined effect of trial counsels professional deficiencies should be considerediii execution of mentally ill persons brannan argues that his execution would be unconstitutional because it is unconstitutional to execute any persons who are severely mentally ill   this claim is barred by procedural default because it was not raised on direct appeal and therefore it can be considered on habeas corpus only if brannan can satisfy the cause and prejudice test to overcome that bar  head v ferrell  ga  iii  sed    ocga § d  the jury in brannans case rejected his claim that he committed the murder as a result of severe mental illness by finding him guilty rather than guilty but mentally ill   see ocga § b and c   as the discussion above demonstrates brannans trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance in their presentation of mental health evidence   because brannan has failed to show that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to prove that he was mentally ill at trial he cannot show cause for his inability to raise a claim based on such a verdict on direct appeal   see ferrell  ga at   sed iii noting that ineffective assistance of counsel can be used to satisfy the cause portion of the cause and prejudice test where a claim is procedurally defaulted   furthermore as an independent alternative holding we conclude that unlike the case of juvenile offenders and mentally retarded persons there is no consensus discernible in the nation or in georgia sufficient to show that evolving standards of decency require a constitutional ban under either the constitution of the united states or under the georgia constitution on executing all  persons with mental illnesses particularly persons who have shown only the sort of mental health evidence that brannan has shown   compare roper v simmons  us   sct   ledd   declaring the execution of juvenile offenders to violate the constitution of the united states  atkins v virginia  us   sct   ledd   declaring the execution of mentally retarded persons to violate the constitution of the united states  fleming v zant  ga   sed   declaring the execution of mentally retarded persons to violate the georgia constitution   having found as an alternative holding that brannans underlying claim is meritless we conclude that he cannot show prejudice from his trial counsels failure to raise it on direct appeal   because brannan has failed to show cause for his failure to prove at trial and complain on direct appeal that he was guilty but mentally ill and because he has failed to show prejudice stemming from that failure we hold that his claim that his execution would be unconstitutional based on his alleged severe mental illness is barred by procedural defaultiv allegedlyimproper arguments by the prosecutor brannan argues that the prosecutor made several improper arguments at trial   this claim is barred by procedural default because it was not raised at trial and on direct appeal and it can be considered on habeas corpus only if brannan can satisfy the cause and prejudice test  ferrell  ga at   sed iii  ocga § d  brannan correctly argues that a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel can satisfy the cause portion of the cause and prejudice test   see ferrell  ga at   sed iii   however none of the arguments brannan complains about were improper and therefore trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to make objections to them   hampton  ga at   sed a  fults  ga at   sed    in arguing that brannan had systematically sought out a designation as disabled from the department of veterans affairs the prosecutor merely suggested a reasonable deduction from the evidence   see gissendaner v state  ga    sed    “counsel certainly are permitted to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial”   similarly the prosecutor made a reasonable deduction from the evidence in suggesting that brannan would pose a future danger in prison based on the evidence presented at the sentencing phase showing that while in jail brannan had surreptitiously obtained razor blades had attached razor blades to the ends of pieces of cardboard had concealed pieces of metal that could potentially be used to open handcuffs and had charged at a guard with his fists clenched as if he were going to strike the guard   compare henry v state  ga    sed     finally the prosecutor did not argue improperly by stating that a death sentence for brannan would deter similar crimes by others  pace v state  ga  f  sed   “it was not improper for the prosecutor to argue that a death sentence would ‘send a message’ and deter other killers”   because none of these arguments were improper brannan cannot show cause through a claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not objecting at trial or prejudice sufficient to overcome the bar to this defaulted claimjudgment affirmed in case no sx   judgment reversed in case no safootnotes   throughout our discussion of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel we focus on the testimony and documentary evidence that was actually presented to the jury by defense counsel without addressing as to each item whether it should have been accepted by the trial court as admissible evidence   we find this approach appropriate in the specific context of considering the adequacy of the defense actually presented and the effect that additional evidence may or may not have had on the jurys deliberations if such additional evidence had been presented   we address here only whether it is unconstitutional to execute all persons with mental illnesses   we acknowledge of course that it is both unconstitutional and unlawful under georgia statutory law to execute persons who are insane at the time of their executions  ford v
