minutes youll be all set and smartasset will have an advisor contact youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey if you do youll be on track for a great financial futureif youre ready to start answer a few questions in smartassets financial advisor selection tool

financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from it doesnt matter if you

automatic taxloss harvesting can help you offset the taxes on investment gains more information view important information about taxloss harvesting taxloss harvesting is available for clients with invested assets of  or more in their schwab intelligent portfolios account clients must enroll to receive this service please be aware that the ability to realize significant tax benefits from taxloss harvesting depends upon a variety of factors and no assurance can be offered that a particular investor will in fact realize significant tax benefitsthis page illustrates the possible benefits of reinvesting federal income tax savings if the portfolio weights associated with a hypothetical portfolio of moderate risk held in a taxable account had been in existence and employed for the period specified and does not reflect actual results the hypothetical example is designed to allow investors to understand and evaluate the application of tax loss harvesting to a portfolio by seeing the potential benefits from federal income tax savings that may have occurred during a certain time period while the hypothetical results reflect the general application of tax loss harvesting they have certain limitations and should not be considered indicative of future results by any client in particular the example results do not reflect actual federal income tax savings in an actual account so there is no guarantee that in fact an actual account would have achieved the results shown moreover the potential federal income tax savings do not reflect investments outside the program that could impact the utilization or realization of such savings the hypothetical example results also assume that federal income tax rates would have remained static over the period index returns were used when etfs in the portfolios were not in existence hypothetical fees were not applied to index returns to simulate etf net of fees performance and therefore the federal income tax savings would have been higher had actual simulated etf fees been applied in the hypothetical portfolios the simulation used total return data for purposes of estimating hypothetical historical federal income tax savings the portfolio weights associated with a hypothetical portfolio of moderate risk were assumed to be static throughout history in reality the portfolio allocation is likely to change over timethe taxloss harvesting example is based on a hypothetical moderate risk portfolio based using the following asset allocation and strategic benchmarks  us large company stocks  us small company stocks  int’l developed large company stocks  int’l developed small company stocks  int’l emerging market stocks  us reits  int’l reits  us treasuries  us investmentgrade corporate bonds  us securitized bonds  us inflationprotected bonds  int’l developed country bonds  us corporate highyield bonds  int’l emerging market bonds  gold and other precious metals and  cash investments tax savings can improve your returns over time because more of your assets stay invested returns on a  investment the chart above illustrates how tax loss harvesting could have affected your account value from  through  based on a hypothetical moderate risk portfolio the actual benefit of taxloss harvesting will vary from year to year and from investor to investor for example there may be fewer losses to harvest in years where markets are consistently rising and investor’s personal tax circumstances may mitigate or eliminate the benefit of tax loss harvesting and the future sale of replacement assets may result in higher capital gains than otherwise would be the case source charles schwab investment advisory click to view more detail this example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only it is not intended to represent a specific investment product it is not tax advice and each investor is strongly encouraged to consult its own tax advisor about the utility of tax loss harvesting the example is based on a hypothetical k moderate risk portfolio held in a taxable account daily etf returns were used when available when not available returns were backfilled with the underlying index when the underlying index was unavailable then the strategic benchmark returns were used a  federal tax rate was assumed on ordinary income and shortterm capital gains and no allowance was made for state taxes tax loss harvesting opportunities were checked for all asset classes the losses being captured had to be greater than a set threshold before the trade was made at the end of every calendar year the tax savings were reinvested in the portfolio the tax savings are equal to the assumed tax rate multiplied by the amount of ordinary income offset by losses captured through the program the amount of ordinary income that may be offset by losses is limited to  or the amount of losses captured plus any tax loss carry forwards whichever is smaller the hypothetical example shown resulted in  of losses that could potentially carry forward to future calendar years there was no rebalancing assumed in the hypothetical portfolio the example assumes that there are no capital gains from any other portfolio the example does not consider the potential future sale of replacement assets which could result in higher capital gains than would be the case without taxloss harvesting range of accounts

from  to  in may  mr schwab stepped down and gave pottruck sole control as ceo on july   the companys board fired pottruck replacing him with its founder and namesake news of pottrucks removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped  percent to  million for the second quarter driven largely by a  percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading after coming back into

materials and in conversations with customers some schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the funds characteristics risk and diversification and continued to represent yieldplus as a relatively lowrisk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value nav between sept   and feb   schwab sold over  billion in shares of yieldplus to customers which accounted for approximately  percent of the amount schwab customers invested in ultra shortterm bond funds during this time period schwabs solicited sales of yieldplus totaled approximately  billion approximately  percent of which were to customers  years of age or older schwab collected approximately  million in fees from sales of the fund”  from june  through june  the total return on schwab’s yieldplus fund yieldplus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid longterm private label mortgages it also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities in doing so schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its sec filings and marketing materials yieldplus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to  unfortunately the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in  and  was  when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses these large losses occurred because schwab’s yieldplus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by schwab it was instead an ultra long bond fund yieldplus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early  yet schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its navthe yieldplus fund made large risky investments in long maturity structured products such as subprime residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” that were inconsistent with the sec’s definition of an ultra short bond fund schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk such a claim would be incorrect for a typical conventionally managed ultra short bond fund but was especially false when made by schwab on behalf of the yieldplus fund in its marketing materials schwab compared returns on the yieldplus fund to returns on the lehman short us treasury  month index the treasury securities included in the lehman index have no credit risk are highly liquid and have short maturities the holdings of the yieldplus fund generally shared none of these attributes  yieldplus had  billion of investor losses including losses

had spent the majority of his  years at the brokerage as charles r schwabs righthand man shared the ceo title with the companys founder from  to  in may  mr schwab stepped down and gave pottruck sole control as ceo on july   the companys board fired pottruck replacing him with its founder and namesake news of pottrucks removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped  percent to  million for the second quarter driven largely by a  percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading after coming back into control mr schwab conceded that the company had lost touch with our heritage and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors he also rolled back pottruck’s fee hikes the company rebounded and earnings began to turn around in  as did the stock the share price was up as high as  since pottruck’s removal ten times since the return of charles schwab the company’s net transfer assets or assets that come from other firms quadrupled from  to  schwab yieldplus fund this fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the s “in written materials and in conversations with customers some schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the funds characteristics risk and diversification and continued to represent yieldplus as a relatively lowrisk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value nav between sept   and feb   schwab sold over  billion in shares of yieldplus to customers which accounted for approximately  percent of the amount schwab customers invested in ultra shortterm bond funds during this time period schwabs solicited sales of yieldplus totaled approximately  billion approximately  percent of which were to customers  years of age or older schwab collected approximately  million in fees from sales of the fund”  from june  through june  the total return on schwab’s yieldplus fund yieldplus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid longterm private label mortgages it also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities in doing so schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its sec filings and marketing materials yieldplus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to  unfortunately the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in  and  was  when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses these large losses occurred because schwab’s yieldplus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by schwab it was instead an ultra long bond fund yieldplus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early  yet schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its navthe yieldplus fund made large risky investments in long maturity structured products such as subprime residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” that were inconsistent with the sec’s definition of an ultra short bond fund schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk such a claim would be incorrect for a typical conventionally managed ultra short bond fund but was especially false when made by schwab on behalf of the yieldplus fund in its marketing materials schwab compared returns on the yieldplus fund to returns on the lehman short us treasury  month index the treasury securities included in the lehman index have no credit risk are highly liquid and have short maturities the holdings of the yieldplus fund generally shared none of these attributes  yieldplus had  billion of investor losses including losses by the founder himself schwab closed the yieldplus funds in   in  the company

namesake news of pottrucks removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped  percent to  million for the second quarter driven largely by a  percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading after coming back into control mr schwab conceded that the company had lost touch with our heritage and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to

ten times since the return of charles schwab the company’s net transfer assets or assets that come from other firms quadrupled from  to  schwab yieldplus fund this fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the s “in written materials and in conversations with customers some schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the funds characteristics risk and diversification and continued to represent yieldplus as a relatively lowrisk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value nav between sept   and feb   schwab sold over  billion in shares of yieldplus to customers which accounted for approximately  percent of the amount schwab customers invested in ultra shortterm bond funds during this time period schwabs solicited sales of yieldplus totaled approximately  billion approximately  percent of which were to customers  years of age or older schwab collected approximately  million in fees from sales of the fund”  from june  through june  the total return on schwab’s yieldplus fund yieldplus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid longterm private label mortgages it also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities in doing so schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its sec filings and marketing materials yieldplus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to  unfortunately the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in  and  was  when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses these large losses occurred because schwab’s yieldplus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by schwab it was instead an ultra long bond fund yieldplus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early  yet schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its navthe yieldplus fund made large risky investments in long maturity structured products such as subprime residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” that were inconsistent with the sec’s definition of an ultra short bond fund schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk such a claim would be incorrect for a typical conventionally managed ultra short bond fund but was especially false when made by schwab on behalf of the yieldplus fund in its marketing materials schwab compared returns on the yieldplus fund to returns on the lehman short us treasury  month index the treasury securities included in the lehman index have no credit risk are highly liquid and have short maturities the holdings of the yieldplus fund generally shared none of these attributes  yieldplus had  billion of investor losses including losses by the founder himself schwab closed the yieldplus funds in   in  the company acquired the k company on july   walter w bettinger the previous chief
