morgan stanley china coceo morgan stanley asia pacific close search profile wei christianson ceo morgan stanley china coceo morgan stanley asia pacific introduction wei sun christianson is ceo of china and coceo of asia pacific for morgan stanley and a member of the firm’s management committee under her leadership morgan stanley has broadened its onshore footprint in china to include domestic securities and bonds underwriting commercial banking asset management trust services and renminbidenominated private equity investing she is based in beijing wei first joined morgan stanley in  working in the firm’s investment banking division she graduated cum laude from amherst college and earned her jd degree from the columbia university school of law did you always want a career in finance my ambition was to work in a profession that is respected in china at that time it was normal for a woman to work but women working in a core role in a highly respected profession were rare a columbia law professor who visited my chinese college once told me that lawyers accountants and doctors were considered amongst the most respected professionals in the us i had a clear picture that i wanted to be a lawyer i decided to repeat my last two years of college at a us liberal arts college amherst i got into columbia and harvard law schools but columbia gave me a full grant my parents told me to never owe anyone any money so i went to columbia i later became a lawyer in new york with orrick herrington  sutcliffe and then in the early s i moved to hong kong and joined the securities and futures commission sfc the local regulator where i helped formulate the regulations to prepare for the hong kong public listings of the first group of mainland chinese companies i realized then that the equity market in china was likely to emerge at a rapid pace and would be an exciting and dynamic area to work that’s when i wanted to make the move into finance how has your experience outside of the financial services industry affected the way you approach your role at the firm given the complexities and challenges of my asia and china roles i couldn’t do my job without that legal and liberal arts education it taught me to identify and analyze issues maintain clarity and provide solutions my legal training also made me sensitive and vigilant to potential issues that the firm could face ensuring we do the right thing and protecting the morgan stanley franchise in the region are critical priorities for us how does our value of putting clients first impact our china franchise’s growth every investment bank has a presence here in china but in many ways morgan stanley is set apart we were often called “the first person to eat the crab” this expression means that one is really a trendsetter we formed chinas first foreign investment bank joint venture in  with china construction bank that experience generated tremendous goodwill for us in china as we were teaching them how to build an international company we’ve been at the forefront of china’s capital markets since the early s and have a lot to be proud of morgan stanley led the first deal to be marketed outside of china in  even before the stock exchanges existed in  we completed the first yankee bond for a chinese issuer a lot of the early stateowned enterprise deals were truly groundbreaking and we had outsized market share this included helping our partner china construction bank become the first bank in china to go public we were also the first to start private equity investing in china and to focus more generally on private companies this led to us underwriting many of the most significant china private sector listings how would you describe the firm’s culture when i considered returning to morgan stanley i asked myself is morgan stanley me and am i morgan stanley of course it was not a long debate the collaborative culture here is very appealing and of course the quality of the team they could have simply brought me in to run investment banking for china but the firm is especially good at seeing other possibilities this further convinced me that this was the place i belonged it’s challenging to build a franchise like morgan stanley in a new cultural environment we first had to build the framework—a core team to be the culture carriers for the firm we have deliberately put people in place who aren’t always asian or chinese the china management team includes quite a few people who have been with the firm a long time who bring a variety of perspectives we benefit not only from their skill set and management experience but also from their knowledge of what morgan stanley stands for they are important role models for younger and newer employees what is the most fulfilling aspect about your work i love the fact that i can directly impact chinese companies or american or european clients there are great potential synergies for so many global companies and fantastic ideas to help them expand their businesses in china i can immediately see the value my team and i can add what’s so exciting is that your work makes a difference beyond yourself you’re really helping others and have access to so many brilliant business leaders they are all inspiring and yet we are able to help them fulfill their ambitions in one of the most

strong interests in fashion my job provides me with unique opportunities to get to know ceos business owners and fashion designers globally i also have the fortune to be friend a few of them i subscribe to a number of fashion magazines to keep myself updated as i don’t have much time for it when i am working so i splurge when i am on the plane travelling or when i am on vacation or holiday wei sun christianson do you read a fashion magazine on a regular basis design museum kind of please see above wei sun christianson do you consult fashion blogs design museum rarely wei sun christianson when did you become aware of fashion design museum i grew up in china during the culture revolution period fashion and stylish clothes were considered bourgeois and nonrevolutionary which could land you in big trouble including jail my mother who was a communist party official however didn’t entirely subscribe to this line of thinking although she had to wear military uniform or plain blue or grey jackets she used to wear high heels with permed stylish hair before culture revolution she suffered a great deal during culture revolution and one of the major criticism was her life style after she became partly paralyzed as the result of mass criticism and torture my mother picked up sewing partly as an exercise of her hands partly to sew for us clothes that were just a bit more stylish than what was generally available but not over done to get us into trouble so while from the outside we may have all been wearing military outfit or drab mao suits during the culture revolution i always felt a bit more stylish than my classmates i think my search for style has its origins in my mother’s strong desire to look at her best and to modestly challenge the chinese system wei sun christianson how would you describe your relationship with clothes design museum although we should not be defined by the clothes we wear i believe what we wear is the extension of ourselves i select my clothes very carefully so i hold strong sentimental value to my clothes as it often reminds of how i was at certain period of time of my life wei sun christianson when did you develop your own ‘style’  do you feel that you have one  what is your basic look design museum as a dedicated professional woman who was a lawyer securities regulator till now a senior banker and senior executive most of my clothes is the office wear with the professional touch wei sun christianson do you have a preference for particular shapes colours fabrics or textures design museum i like quality tailored suits that enhance femininity i love variety of colors or textures but floral prints do not suit me wei sun christianson who are your favourite designers and why historical and contemporary design museum escada for suits jeans chanel for suits st john for suits dolce gabana for pants suits maxmara for pants suits christin dior fendi for cocktail wear roberto cavali for casual wear for chinese traditional outfit i wear shanghai xu tailored qipao and i start to wear a young chinese designer xia zi chen’s cocktail dress wei sun christianson do you use a personal shopper design museum no i like the experience of buying my own clothes it is about knowing yourself trying different things is part of the fun wei sun christianson how much do you involve your partner in clothes buying design museum he does not care much to shop with me but he is a great sounding board for helping me choose the right clothes for different occasions he is particularly helpful on choosing jewellery  he should be good at it since he has purchased virtually all my jewellery for me wei sun christianson what percentage of your income goes on clothes purchases annually design museum i never go on dedicated shopping trips i shop when i have time and am in the mood for it often during business trips in nyc paris london when i have a few hours free time i am not an outrage spender on clothes but i want to make sure each piece of my clothes suits me and is high quality wei sun christianson how many pairs of shoes or handbags do you have design museum that is the secret that i would like to keep to myself wei sun christianson how important is hair and makeup to you design museum i believe hair is as important as one’s outfit i pay a lot of attention to my hair and get my hair washed mostly at the hair salon partly because i really value a hair style that i feel fits my personality but also because my hair salon is a place where i can relax and unwind skin care is something i take seriously and always constantly in search of better products as a board member for estee lauder group i am fortunate to have great access to the best skincare makeup and hair products i love to collect makeup products from various brands especially the brands under estee lauder however i do not wear much make up during a regular business day because i am always on the run even when i apply on more make up for especial occasions i tend to do my makeup in the car having a driver in an environment with a lot of traffic jam is a huge benefit wei sun christianson do you buy seasonally or when the need or mood dictates design museum i only shop when i have time and am in the mood so my shopping is entirely unpredictable and spontaneous wei sun christianson is there a difference between your public and private wardrobe  if so what are the reasons behind this design museum absolutely my public wardrobe is about professional style and presentation my private wardrobe is less formal and comfort with style wei sun christianson how do you view fashion and clothes in relation to your professional standing design museum when i started in the financial services sector at a law firm in new york city i wore very conservative outfits  dark suits with long skirts they had a kind of masculine feel to them when i moved to hong kong i started to work at the securities and futures commission i noticed that hk professional women tend to wear more brightcolored business suits this inspired me during those years i found i liked color and texture and cut i decided that while i was working in a man’s world i was not going to suppress my femininity in an attempt to blend in i was fortunate to have bosses that cared more about performance and substance than conformity i hope that i can inspire other women in my profession to express their style and individuality through what they chose to wear and how they wear it wei sun christianson to what extent does your professional role inform your fashion choices design museum my role as the ceo of the regional business provides me with access to senior government and corporate clients all over the world therefore the good exposure to these caliber of people helps me to refine my style from time to time wei sun christianson does fashion empower you what outfit would most empower you and why design museum fashion absolutely empowers me i believe fashion can be a secret weapon for not just women but also for men a right outfit can be a strong statement about one’s self esteem confidence and presence for me as a senior executivebanker business suits whether pants suits or skirt suits help me to deliver the image and message wei sun christianson what does fashion in the future need to do to help women  to empower them design museum i think the key is not necessarily for the fashion industry to design more stylish clothes but to help women to cultivate their own tastestyle that is best suited for them often times i find women chasing for the latest fad without the judgment whether it suits them in addition fashion is about full presentation from head to toe therefore women need to be educated about how to match clothes with the right hair style the makeup and the accessories wei sun christianson discover more  jan   faith fashion and power in muslim dress fashion historian amber butchart guestcurates a programme of
