tax benefit expense       income tax benefit expense      net income loss          sales the decrease in sales to approximately  during the three months ended august   from approximately  million during the three months ended august    is primarily due to our largest customer ceasing ordering in february  there were no sales to this customer during the three month period ended august   and the likelihood of this customer continuing to purchase our product in the future is remote the loss of business from this customer has had a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the short term and may continue to have a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the long term if these revenues are not replaced by new products and other existing or new customers while the company has experienced decreased sales and anticipates lower total sales in the current fiscal year the company has developed an innovative new concept of a world filter product to sell worldwide where quality drinking water is not available both the bottle and the cap will be sourced locally to make the finished product competitive in the international market the company initiated these foreign sales plans during the three months ended august   with the appointment of its first international sales agent in sri lanka in addition to this appointment we have identified sales agents for india south korea and the philippines and are pursuing other contacts to dramatically expand this effort to expand our customer base accordingly management believes that over the remainder of the fiscal year sufficient working capital and liquidity will be obtained from revenues to sustain operations management believes that sales will increase from the current quarter with the launch of this world filter product

based on product mix selling general and administrative expenses these expenses remained relatively consistent period over period increasing by approximately  or  during the period ended august   compared to the same period in the prior year the companys management expects selling general and administrative expenses to decrease during the remainder of the current fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was relatively flat from period to period but the slight increase is due to additional computer equipment purchased during the period ended august   income tax expense benefit the company recorded income tax benefit of approximately  due to the pretax loss of approximately  during the three months ended august   compared to an income tax expense of approximately  related to pretax income of approximately  during the three month period ended august   the company has a net deferred tax asset at august   of approximately  and management believes no valuation allowance is needed at this time net income loss net loss for the three month period ended august   was approximately  compared to net income for the three month period ended august   of approximately  this was primarily due to the decrease of approximately  million in sales  and the loss of our largest customer as noted above we remain focused on the primary factors affecting our bottom line and look to continue to improve the companys profitability in the upcoming periods during fiscal     six month period ended august   compared to the corresponding period in
