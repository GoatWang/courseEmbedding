craft beer yes we can jul    et from abita brewing company new orleans july   prnewswire  the abita brewing company is pleased to announce it plans to offer three of its flagship brews in cans  amber purple haze and jockamo ipa abita brewing company president david blossman said we feel confident that todays cans are a quality solution that will preserve and protect the flavor of abita  for many years people associated craft beer with glass bottles but the perception and the technology of the aluminum beverage can has changed the new abita cans will be coated with a special waterbased lining to protect and preserve the great taste of the beer  this lining insulates the beer from the cans interior surface  canning also limits exposure to uv light and oxygen two elements that can damage the taste of beer you can take cans to places where glass might not be convenient or allowedparades fishing tubing golfing or the beach said blossman  weve made it even easier to bring abita to the party wherever its happening   cans are easy to recycle weigh less to ship and the average new beer can is made of  recycled aluminum  abita is committed to a greener environment  we conserve energy and water create our own biogas and drive greener vehicles  we use recycled content in our bottles and packaging  aluminum cans are one more way abita is working to keep our part of the world green and clean abita will offer the canned product in six and  packs and expect it to reach store shelves early in   the canning will be based at the brewery in abita springs  abita will continue packaging in glass just as they have since they began brewing in  the abita brewing company was founded in abita springs louisiana and is the oldest and largest craft brewer in the southeast abita is the th largest commercial brewer by production volume in the nation and the th largest craft brewer in the united states  sales for the company should exceed  barrels this year abita brewing company produces seven flagship brews  abita amber golden light turbodog purple haze jockamo ipa and restoration pale ale  abita also offers five seasonal beers three harvest brews three big beers and a draftonly
