of york where the company relocated in  flowed the wide susquehanna river the towns original name spring forge reflected its early industry an iron forge which during the american revolution manufactured supplies for the continental army the forge was in operation until  when jacob hauer bought the buildings and converted them into a paper mill some  miles southeast near the maryland town of gunpowder falls another paper mill called loucks hoffman  company began operations in the s it was here in  that yearold philip h glatfelter began his first job in the paper trade glatfelter whose wife amanda was the sister of jacob loucks worked in the firm for seven years and in  at the height of the civil war glatfelter decided to go into business on his own by this time hauer had died and his spring paper mill was being sold at an orphans probate court a printed announcement of the sale mentioned a tract of land containing about  acres … a large stone paper mill a frame machine house stone stock house and four tenant houses the mill itself had two burnham water wheels propelled by the codorus creek four largecapacity engines and a inch cylinder paper machine glatfelter learned about the mill from loucks whose second wife mary was the daughter of jacob hauer on december   one month after president lincolns famous speech at nearby gettysburg glatfelter bought the property for  glatfelters new paper business initially called spring forge mill began operations in july  with a daily capacity of  pounds its first product was newsprint which glatfelter made from a pulp of rye straw mixed with a smaller amount of straw and rags collected from various cotton gins along the regions railway lines this pulp material was retrieved in spacious railcars known as barns because at the time spring forge itself did not have a railway line barns returning from the cotton gins could get no closer than jefferson and york some five and ten miles respectively from the mill when the town changed its name in  to spring grove the company thus became the spring grove mill for the first  years newsprint continued to be the companys main product and during this period it made impressive gains in production from the initial capacity of  pounds per day the mill was able to expand to  pounds in   in  and  by  this increased capacity was made possible by the companys investment in new modern facilities in  for example the mill was moved farther north along the codorus creek and next to it the company constructed a new building costing  and containing an inch paper machine two years later spring forge celebrated the opening of its rail line which ran through the mills new site in  glatfelter entered into an agreement with pusey and jones company of delaware to build a inch fourdrinier machine allowing the mill to produce a considerably wider roll of paper named after henry and sealy fourdrinier who patented an early form of the machine in england in  the fourdrinier machine fed pulp onto a continuous wire belt shook it to remove excess water and then pressed and dried the pulp into paper glatfelters new fourdrinier machine was until  the largest in the world and the extremely wide paper rolls made by the machine helped him gain new customers in  when the philadelphia public ledger began operating two inch printing presses spring grove mill was the only business in the country that could supply the paper the mill also produced paper for a variety of other newspapers in pennsylvania and maryland including the philadelphia evening telegraph highquality paper lateth century soon glatfelter also changed his pulpmaking methods which would result in a better quality paper prior to  the mill mechanically separated the fibers of the raw materials probably with the use of a grinder this process acceptable for newsprint and other paper intended for temporary use had a number of drawbacks mechanical separation tended to fragment and shorten the fibers thus lessening their ability to bind and make strong paper moreover fragmentation left considerable debris in the pulp and various remaining chemical constituents caused the paper to grow yellow with age even when new such paper did not have a high whiteness and was difficult to bleach company perspectives beyond paper…its all the things we do above and beyond making great paper that make us unique as a result glatfelter began to take note of a new chemical method called the soda process which enabled a highquality paper to be made from wood fibers it was developed in  by englishman hugh burgess who a few years later immigrated to the united states to set up a paper mill in pennsylvania in the soda process wood chips were boiled in a caustic alkali at a high temperature and pressure afterward the separated fibers were washed in water and then bleached in  glatfelter built a giant sodaprocess mill which was used to make pulp from jack pine poplar wood and straw straw however came to be used in decreasing quantities by  this new production helped the company surpass  in total sales and four years later the number of employees reached  with its new pulpprocessing method the company in  was able to make one of its most important changes the suspension of newsprint production and the subsequent focus on highquality paper for books lithographs and business forms for this purpose another sodaprocess pulp mill was installed in  and by  the company had become an industry leader of highquality uncoated printing paper the founders son william l glatfelter entered the business in  after graduating from gettysburg college and that year he began a long apprenticeship under the guidance of his father he had worked at the mill for  years when in  the business was incorporated as p h glatfelter company the following year the founder died and the reins to the company were handed to his son president of the company from  to  william glatfelter oversaw a tremendous increase in production as well as continued advances in chemically processed wood pulp in  in order to manage the mills growing need for wood he established glatfelter wood pulp company a wholly owned subsidiary with more than  acres of timberland in southern maryland additional timberland in maryland and eastern virginia would eventually boost the acreage to  william glatfelter was responsible for instituting a number of other major projects many of which were completed in the early s a new basin for storing up to  tons of coal the fuel used to fire the companys highpressured boilers was constructed during this period as was a large indoor loading room where newly manufactured paper was placed on waiting railroad cars a tachometer which measured rotational speed was attached to all of the companys machines thus providing a more accurate way to monitor production most spectacular was the new fourdrinier paper machine installed in  which was capable of making rolls of fine paper  inches wide this giant paper machine designed by glatfelter engineers and housed in a new building was the worlds first fourdrinier to have an easily replaceable wire belt perhaps reflecting these changes spring groves main street where the companys office building was located was first paved in  key dates  philip h glatfelter restarts operations at the spring forge

the carbonless and specialty papers business of newpage corporation surviving great depression in  just a year before the great stock market crash annual production at p h glatfelter company had reached  million pounds and the number of employees stood at  that year in keeping with the companys policy of maintaining a modern efficient mill philip h glatfelter ii williams son introduced a new tenyear modernization program which included the installation in  of an even larger inch fourdrinier machine as a result the outlook for the company seemed especially bright but soon conditions noticeably changed for the worse by  the country was quickly falling into an economic crisis and sales at p h glatfelter company and other paper concerns were plummeting william glatfelter moreover unexpectedly died in april unlike many other firms p h glatfelter company managed to survive the great depression of the s and its new president p h glatfelter ii was even able to complete his modernization program at a cost of some  million as part of this program one of the companys pulp mills was refurbished and its capacity was doubled when the economy picked up again during world war ii p h glatfelter company added among other improvements new equipment for bleaching paper p h glatfelter ii president until january   guided the company through the postwar economic boom and started a new effort at reforestation and environmental stewardship in  the company set aside  acres of land near fairfield pennsylvania to create the states first tree farm between  and  it spent  million to build a wastewater treatment plant and a new ton boiler was installed in  to more efficiently burn a pulp byproduct called black liquor during this time there were also millions of dollars spent on capital improvements for increased production for example the companys seventh and eighth paper machines were added in  and  respectively and between  and  capital expenditures alone were nearly  million an especially ambitious project was the p h glatfelter dam completed in  along a stretch of the codorus creek about five miles south of spring grove the dam created a billiongallon reservoir called lake marburg which was intended to guarantee a reliable water supply for the glatfelter mill farther downstream in addition the reservoir was eventually surrounded by a newly created acre codorus state park which included a public swimming pool and provided opportunities for camping hiking horseback riding and boating the project cost some  million split equally between p h glatfelter company and the pennsylvania bureau of state parks key acquisitions bergstromand ecusta p h glatfelter ii retired in  and his son p h glatfelter iii became president a position he held for a decade an early challenge for the new president was hurricane agnes which hit the eastern seaboard in june  and created severe floods in spring grove according to p h glatfelter iii the flood caused more damage and financial loss to the company than any other single event among other notable developments during his tenure was the  decision by glatfelter employees to join the united paperworkers international union and in  the company received the isaac walton league of america clean water award the company entered a new product line in  with its purchase of bergstrom paper company a leading manufacturer of recycled printing paper with mills in neenah wisconsin and west carrollton ohio the west carrollton mill was sold in  but during the s the company rebuilt all three paper machines at the neenah plant thomas c norris named president in  was the first person outside the glatfelter family to run the company his experience with p h glatfelter company stretched back to  when he took a parttime job in the paper mill at the age of  like his predecessors norris oversaw a program of new capital expenditures including the rebuilding of two paper machines at spring grove even more significant was the companys   million purchase of ecusta corporation located in pisgah forest north carolina which made extremely thin flax paper for the tobacco industry the purchase of ecusta doubled the number of glatfelter employees from  to  and provided along with uncoated and recycled printing paper a third major underpinning of the companys sales uncoated printing paper however remained its core product which by the early s made up some  percent of all paper used in the united states for hardcover trade books among the many wellknown books printed on glatfelter paper were norman mailers harlots ghost  stephen kings four past midnight  and alexandra ripleys scarlett  the sequel to margaret mitchells gone with the wind which in  used glatfelter paper for the original printing great books of the western world a multivolume publication of classics was printed with recycled paper from the neenah mill p h glatfelter company headed into the s with an exceptionally strong financial base secured by its remarkable lack of debt although p h glatfelter company had occasionally borrowed money for example  million in  to complete its acquisition of ecusta even this loan was paid off in just two years the companys strength was also found in its emphasis on specialized highquality paper which was much less affected by recurring business cycles than largevolume commodity paper products in  glatfelters chief financial officer m a johnson ii explained our emphasis is on profit not on volume thats why we continue to be a niche company one that is competing in areas where were not banging heads with people who are commodityoriented starting in the mids the company expressed considerable selfconfidence in its financial strength by its repurchase of millions of outstanding shares of glatfelter stock with its financial security and its emphasis on specialty products p h glatfelter company was able to profitably weather the declining market conditions for paper which beginning in  were spurred by industry overproduction glatfelters record sales of  million in   million in  and  million in  tumbled to  million and  million respectively in  and  even so the company still posted a respectable net profit of  million in  down from a high of  million in  the companys good health was credited to its oldfashioned conservative business philosophy as well as to the able guidance of president ceo and chairman thomas norris who in  was one of only  corporate leaders given financial world s silver award for superior business leadership and achievement difficulties glatfelter received a huge blow in late  when philip morris companies inc announced that it would singlesource its domestic cigarette paper from kimberlyclark corporation glatfelters ecusta division thus lost its largest domestic tobacco paper customer overall company revenues thereby dropped to a lower level for the two years following running at  million in  and  million in  during s fourth quarter glatfelter attempted to sell ecusta but the offers that came in were considered to be below market value the company subsequently decided to take a onetime charge of  million to write down the value of ecusta leading to a net loss of  million for  this followed a barely profitable  when earnings stood at  million glatfelter rebounded some in the mids but continued to be buffeted by difficult market conditions through the entire second half of the decade overcapacity in the tobacco paper sector and increased competition in the area of specialty papers forced prices down depressing both revenues and earnings glatfelters tobacco paper business was particularly vulnerable as cigarette liability lawsuits and subsequent settlements were forcing cigarette makers to raise prices and to pressure their paper suppliers to lower their prices in  glatfelter responded to these pressures by announcing layoffs at ecustas pisgah forest facility with head count reduced by about  generating annual savings of approximately  million glatfelter also looked overseas for a potential boost acquiring schoeller  hoesch group from deutsche beteiligungs ag in january  for about  million schoeller  hoesch with sales of  million was headquartered in gernsbach germany where it owned and operated a paper mill the company also held a  percent controlling interest in a paper mill in odet france and owned other production facilities in wisches france the philippines and summerville south carolina schoeller  hoesch was founded in  as a pulp producer then evolved into a leading producer of engineered papers it was similar to glatfelter in its focus on maintaining leading positions in a number of niche growth markets at the time of the acquisition schoeller  hoesch was the worlds number one maker of tea bags with global market share in excess of  percent the german firm also held  percent of the european market for cigarette papers  percent of the european market for metalized label paper and  percent of the global market for overlay paper one of the unique aspects of schoeller  hoesch was its pulp mill in the philippines which processed abaca fiber a versatile fiber with a broad range of applications as a result of this acquisition glatfelters revenues reached a record  million in  its debt load was also substantially increased however leaving its debttocapital ratio at  percent not unusual by industry standards but high for the conservativeminded company in order to further enhance its international visibility glatfelter in late  moved its stock from the american stock exchange to the new york stock exchange in a changefilled year norris announced in june that he intended to retire in  george h glatfelter ii who had been senior vicepresident was named the new president and ceo with norris remaining chairman until his retirement in may  as a nephew of p h glatfelter iii and greatgreatgrandson of the founder g h glatfelter ii represented the fifth generation of glatfelters to run the company another historical development came in september  when the company relocated its headquarters from spring grove to york pennsylvania glatfelters executives were thereby separated from the facilities in the companys founding town enabling them to focus on the companys entire worldwide operations and leave management of the spring grove mill and the glatfelter division to the appropriate managers revenues for  fell  percent to  million principally because paper prices were forced down as a result of an industry oversupply restructuring amid aprolonged downturn in early  glatfelter retreated further from the tobacco paper sector by reducing the production capacity at its ecusta division by about onethird and cutting the workforce there by approximately  then in march the company launched an ambitious strategic plan aiming to cut annual costs by  million and push revenues over the  billion mark by  further changes came in  when glatfelter elected to exit from tobacco papers altogether in order to focus its full attention on specialty papers and engineered products the ecusta division was sold to purico ltd of the united kingdom for approximately  million plus the assumption of about  million in liabilities glatfelter recorded a pretax loss of  million on the sale which slashed  earnings to just  million at the same time schoeller  hoesch began a twoyear program of shifting its tobacco papers production to other products the completion of which signaled glatfelters departure from that sector in the fall of  glatfelter introduced a new corporate logo and a new slogan beyond paper the changes according to robert p newcomer company president and chief operating officer were meant to represent the firms worldwide employees who go above and beyond what is expected to meet customers needs concurrently the company began referring to itself as simply glatfelter dropping the initials p h although its official name remained p h glatfelter company the new logos teal green color was meant to represent the companys commitment to the environment for years glatfelter had been criticized for discharges into the codorus creek and for odor coming from the spring grove plant during the s the pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep had fined the company several times for violations of water and air pollution laws in august  glatfelter settled a lawsuit brought by the pennsylvania public interest research group for  million plus a commitment to spend an additional  million on improvements to the spring grove mill to eliminate the codorus creeks distinctive red color in november the company announced plans to spend  million on a project to eliminate most of the odors coming from the mill in addition glatfelter was one of several companies that federal and state regulators had identified as being responsible for pollution in the lower fox river and in the bay of green bay downstream from the firms neenah wisconsin plant by  glatfelter was estimating that its share of the remediation costs were likely to range between  million and  million over a period of as much as  years or more after sales dropped to  million in  a decline of nearly  percent in concert with the poor economic climate glatfelter announced in april  that its goal of generating  billion in sales by  was unlikely to be met in fact sales fell still further in  declining to  million as the industry downturn dragged on glatfelter incurred another negative mark on its environmental record in june  when it agreed to pay a  million fine to the pennsylvania dep for illegally discharging waste into the codorus creek on a weekly basis from around the mids through december  as it contended with stagnant revenues in  and  glatfelter implemented a series of restructurings to strengthen its future earnings after selling  acres of timberland in maryland for  million in early  glatfelter that september announced plans to shut down a papermaking machine and the deinking process at its neenah facility and in the process cut the staff by more than half or  positions in december  the company shut down one of the six paper machines at its spring grove mill then the following april glatfelter announced cutbacks at spring grove eventually laying off  employees there or  percent of the workers restructuring and other charges for  and  totaled  million and  million respectively at the same time glatfelter was pushing to generate a higher percentage of its revenues from newly introduced products such as round tea bags paper used in inkjet printers and casting papers used in the production of simulated leather by  nearly  percent of sales came from products introduced within the previous five years  turning acquisitive glatfelters  results highlighted by increases in both revenues and gross profits appeared to show a company in a recovery long in the making from this strengthened position glatfelter began seeking out strategic acquisitions in april  the company acquired the carbonless and specialty papers business of newpage corporation for approximately  million carbonless paper which has ink built into it is commonly used for duplicates of personal checks and multiplepart forms glatfelter gained plants in chillicothe and fremont ohio employing about  workers and generating annual sales of about  million potentially increasing the companys revenues over  billion the new facilities enabled glatfelter to shut down its aging neenah plant and shift that plants production to the chillicothe mill pretax charges of more than  million were incurred in connection with this closure also in  glatfelter announced plans to sell an additional  acres of timberland over the following three to five years in a march announcement the company revealed that it had purchased j r crompton ltds lydney mill in gloucestershire england for  million and had signed an agreement with crompton to acquire its simpson clough mill in lancashire for  million these mills produced wetlaid nonwoven products such as tea and coffee filter papers lens tissue and doublesided adhesive tape substrates in june however the simpson clough mill deal fell through because of complications arising out of cromptons bankruptcy proceedings at the same time the european commission opened an indepth probe of glatfelters purchase of the lydney mill raising the very real possibility that the deal might be blocked regulators were concerned that the purchase of the mill would provide glatfelter with a very high share of the european market for coffee filters and tea bags a rejection of the deal coupled with the failure to consummate the other uk mill purchase was likely to represent a clear though perhaps only shortterm setback to glatfelters ambitions to become a global leader in specialty papers and engineered products thomas riggs updated david e salamie

were handed to his son president of the company from  to  william glatfelter oversaw a tremendous increase in production as well as continued advances in chemically processed wood pulp in  in order to manage the mill’s growing need for wood he established glatfelter wood pulp company a wholly owned subsidiary with more than  acres of timberland in southern maryland additional timberland in maryland and eastern virginia would eventually boost the acreage to  william glatfelter was responsible for instituting a number of other major projects many of which were completed in the early s a new basin for storing up to  tons of coal—the fuel used to fire the company’s highpressured boilers—was constructed during this period as was a large indoor loading room where newly manufactured paper was placed on waiting railroad cars a tachometer which measured rotational speed was attached to all of the company’s machines thus providing a more accurate way to monitor production most spectacular was the new fourdrinier paper machine installed in  which was capable of making rolls of fine paper  inches wide this giant paper machine designed by glatfelter engineers and housed in a new building was the world’s first fourdrinier to have an easily replaceable wire belt perhaps reflecting these changes spring grove’s main street where the company’s office building was located was first paved in  in  just a year before the great stock market crash annual production at p h glatfelter company had reached  million pounds and the number of employees stood at  that year in keeping with the company’s policy of “maintaining a modern efficient mill” p h glatfelter ii william’s son introduced a new tenyear modernization program which included the installation of an even larger inch fourdrinier machine as a result the outlook for the company seemed especially bright but just two years later conditions noticeably changed for the worse by  the country was quickly falling into an economic crisis and sales at p h glatfelter company and other paper concerns were plummeting william glatfelter moreover unexpectedly died in april unlike many other firms p h glatfelter company managed to survive the depression of the s and its new president p h glatfelter ii was even able to complete his modernization program at a cost of some  million as part of this program one of the company’s pulp mills was refurbished and its capacity was doubled when the economy picked up again during world war ii p h glatfelter company added among other improvements new equipment for bleaching paper p h glatfelter ii president until january   guided the company through the postwar economic boom and started a new effort at reforestation and environmental stewardship in  the company set aside  acres of land near fairfield pennsylvania to create the state’s first tree farm between  and  it spent  million to build a wastewater treatment plant and a new ton boiler was installed in  to more efficiently burn a pulp byproduct called black liquor during this time there were also millions of dollars spent on capital improvements for increased production for example the company’s seventh and eighth paper machines were added in  and  respectively and between  and  capital expenditures alone were nearly  million an especially ambitious project was the p h glatfelter dam completed in  along a stretch of the codorus creek about five miles south of spring grove the dam created a billiongallon reservoir called lake marburg which was intended to guarantee a reliable water supply for the glatfelter mill farther downstream in addition the reservoir was eventually surrounded by a newly created acre codorus state park which included a public swimming pool and provided opportunities for camping hiking horseback riding and boating the project cost some  million split equally between p h glatfelter company and the pennsylvania bureau of state parks p h glatfelter ii retired in  and his son p h glatfelter iii became president a position he held for a decade an early challenge for the new president was hurricane agnes which hit the eastern seaboard in june of  and created severe floods in spring grove according to p h glatfelter iii the flood “caused more damage and financial loss to the company than any other single event” among other notable developments during his tenure was the  decision by glatfelter employees to join the united paperworkers international union and in  the company received the isaac walton league of america clean water award the company entered a new product line in  with its purchase of bergstrom paper company a leading manufacturer of recycled printing paper with mills in neenah wisconsin and west carrollton ohio the west carrollton mill was sold in  but during the s the company rebuilt all three paper machines at the neenah plant thomas c norris named president in  was the first person outside the glatfelter family to run the company his experience with p h glatfelter company stretched back to  when he took a parttime job in the paper mill at the age of  like his predecessors norris oversaw a program of new capital expenditures including the rebuilding of two paper machines at spring grove even more significant was the company’s  million purchase of ecusta corporation located in pisgah forest north carolina which made extremely thin flax paper for the tobacco industry the purchase of ecusta doubled the number of glatfelter employees from  to  and provided along with uncoated and recycled printing paper the third major underpinning of the company’s sales uncoated printing paper however remained its core product which by the early s made up some  percent of all paper used in the united states for hardcover trade books among the many wellknown books printed on glatfelter paper were norman mailer’s harlot’s ghost  steven king’s four past midnight  and alexandra ripley’s scarlett  the sequel to margaret mitchell’s gone with the wind which in  used glatfelter paper for the original printing great books of the western world a multivolume publication of classics was printed with recycled paper from the neenah mill p h glatfelter company headed into the s with an exceptionally strong financial base secured by its remarkable lack of debt although p h glatfelter company has occasionally borrowed money—for example  million in  to complete its acquisition of ecusta—even this loan was paid off in just two years the company’s strength was also found in its emphasis on specialized highquality paper which was much less affected by recurring business cycles than largevolume“commodity” paper products in  glatfelter’s chief financial officer m a johnson ii explained“our emphasis is on profit not on volume that’s why we continue to be a niche company one that is competing in areas where we’re not banging heads with people who are commodityoriented” since the mids the company has expressed considerable selfconfidence in its financial strength by its repurchase of millions of outstanding shares of glatfelter stock with its financial security and its emphasis on specialty products p h glatfelter company was able to weather profitably the declining market conditions for paper which beginning in  were spurred by industry overproduction glatfelter’s record sales of  million in   million in  and  million in  tumbled to  million and  million respectively in  and  even so the company still posted a respectable net profit of  million in  down from a high of  million in  the company’s good health was credited to its oldfashioned conservative business philosophy as well as to the able guidance of its president chief executive officer and chairman of the board thomas norris

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
