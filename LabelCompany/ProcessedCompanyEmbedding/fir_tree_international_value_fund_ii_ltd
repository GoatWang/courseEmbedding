corporation fir tree led the ad hoc group of investors in fgic insured bonds through an innovative restructuring over the last three years that will likely serve as a blueprint for the industry going

will work to maximize value for lehman creditors fir tree said it looked for people who are highly respected in a range of critical areas including real estate derivatives private equity and restructuring wall street journal december   lehman says its active board approach resembles a private equity board and says its new directors were recruited to work closely with the team that has been managing its still considerable realestate holdings…given the highly resultsoriented nature of this compensation package …i would say this is an eminently reasonable package and likely to deliver more value to debtors… said paul hodgson compensation expert at gmi ratings dow jones march   nextel communications formerly nxtl nasdaq “fir tree approached nextel with an inventive debt for equity

to the rh donnelley board as fir tree’s representative at the time donnelley was the largest yellow page business in the us and it had recently been spun off from its parent company dun  bradstreet

funds humanewatch may   caribbean capers “humane society” stuffs  million in offshore funds it’s hard for the humane society of the united states to save animals when it has parked  million offshore that’s what readers of usa today are learning with our fullpage ad in the paper this morning the humane society of the united states scandalously only gives  of its budget to local pet shelters and it doesn’t run any pet shelters of its own but it has plenty of money to bury in the sand deep in hsus’s latest tax return is the group’s admission that it made “investments” totaling  million in the “central american and the caribbean” region there were no reported investments of any kind abroad in hsus’s previous three years of tax returns why is a group that pledges to rescue animals in need quietly burying  million in caribbean accounts and where exactly is this  million “invested” it turns out hsus funneled megabucks to several funds located in the cayman islands the secretive place where secretive people stuff their secretive money bond villaintype stuff according to its t and supplemental forms hsus made the following “investments”  to ascend partners fund i lp a cayman hedge fund  to bkm holdings cayman ltd  million to fore multi strategy offshore fund ltd in the caymans  million to hayman capital offshore partners lp in bermuda  million invested in fir tree international value fund in the caymans why would a us charity be putting  million in the caribbean and the figures above only add up to a little over  million—where’s the other  million hsus is a nonprofit it’s not in the business of investing money in hedge funds to make a profit it’s in the business—according to its ads—of saving animals now now means right away—not in  years when hsus may have made a loss on its caribbean investments hsus reports losing  in  on various partnerships in the t there’s a reason people write “hu” it’s because money seems to come first for the cynics and the beancounters running hsus and it’s one more reason to give to your local shelter directly not to a questionable national organization that might stick your donations in the caymans instead of helping the shelter pets it cynically uses in its ads posted on  at  am by humane watch team topics main permalink tweet calvin rice shameful even more shameful is the f act that our legal system allows them to continue
