alphasign in  join nowgo»halcon resources a new player on the permian block that can surprisejul  about halcon resources hk richard zeits oil  gas commodities longshort equity research analystmarketplacezeits oil analytics summaryfollowing the eagle ford and bakken divestitures halcón resources is about to emerge as a focused pureplay permian operator with a half a billion cash pilerapid production growth is prefundedanother major acreage acquisition is highly likelyunder a favorable operating scenario the stock can deliver meaningful upside several catalysts exist in the near termwhile risks are also significant the riskreward profile looks attractive on july  halcón resources hk announced the sale of its operated williston basin assets for  billion the strategic move revealed the portfolio’s intrinsic value and redefined the company’s operational future the stock reacted vigorously trading up  on the day of the announcement from  to  so far the shares have sustained the gain the transaction completes halcón’s repositioning virtually all significant assets the company held in its portfolio just six months ago – the eagle ford east el halcón and operated bakken – are now gone in the aftermath halcón is emerging as an upandcoming pureplay permian operator with an intriguing set of assets and a large growthenabling cash position in effect halcón is a completely new company as a postbankruptcy entity the stock has been “under the radar” with a thin public float and hence poor liquidity and scarce sellside following it is worthwhile to assess the “new” halcón’s strategic position prospects and valuation strategic implications of the announcement the properties being sold accounted for threequarters of halcón’s existing production were “core” in terms of development upside the fbir area and offered a longterm option on a recovery in oil prices the williams county acreage total acreage included in the divestiture is  net operated acres please note that the prolific fbir acreage has been in full development mode for some time production averaged  boed during the second quarter with high oil content the sec pv value of the properties was  million as of  yearend the buyer is a portfolio company of arclight capital a highly sophisticated private equity acquirer based on these metrics and given macro uncertainties i view the price received in the transaction as respectable and given halcón’s objectives consider the outcome of the auction a major strategic win for the company given that halcón is monetizing a larger part of its asset base in terms of current market value the move may appear radical however considering the company’s strategic pivot towards the permian and high leverage that stood in the way of the permian strategy the divestiture is not at all surprising and arguably had been inevitable the asset sale addresses several of the company’s imminent challenges dramatically improves liquidity and leverage eliminating the risk of forced equity issuance under lowprice oil scenarios generates funds the company has needed to exercise its options on an attractive acreage position in ward county in the permian  million provides ample funding for accelerated development in the permian perhaps most importantly creates a substantial cash reserve sufficient to anchor another major acreage acquisition a transaction as large as  billion is conceivable assuming an equity component in financing  a recent acquisition by carrizo oil  gas nasdaqcrzo provides an illustration of what is possible financially and how the market can welcome such initiatives a case can be made that halcón is now much better positioned for survival under lowprice oil scenarios value creation via drill bit and equityfunded ma growth than it was six months ago despite the much smaller footprint the divestiture has the meaning of rejuvenating the asset base halcón effectively monetized a maturing developmentstage foundational asset the fbir bakken as well as highercostofsupply tier  assets the williams county bakken and el halcón to fund acreage capture in much “younger” technically challenging plays in one of the lowestcost shale oil provinces in the us the oily portion of the delaware basin given halcón’s operational strength on one hand and high cost of capital on the other the move makes strategic and financial sense in my opinion obviously this transformation does not come for free halcón sold its legacy portfolio in a challenging macro environment whereas the private market for acreage in the permian has remained redhot still i view the transition as a positive development in its nature it is an attempt to build a path to a higher stock price in my view the chosen strategy has good chances of succeeding and has already been validated by the market’s reaction to the announcement as a pureplay permian operator with a strong balance sheet and liquidity halcón is now well positioned to follow the same playbook that several “permian charmers” have implemented with tremendous success exploit the wide arbitrage between acreage valuations in the private market and acreage valuations implied by publicly traded acquirers’ stock prices in this regard i believe that additional acreage acquisitions by halcón in the permian funded with surplus cash on hand and better priced equity are logical and arguably inevitable from investors’ perspective halcón will likely have the appeal of being one of few small yet operationally credible publiclytraded ep companies in the permian a relatively small acquisition can make a significant difference for the stock therefore when evaluating halcón’s equity i believe it is important to think two steps ahead two years from now the company’s acreage could double while production could exceed  mboed the increase in the share count and net debt as well as risks inevitably associated with acreage acquisitions also need to be factored into the equation on a pro forma basis halcón’s stock appears priced at a significant discount to the “permian charmer” peer group while the company has a lot of work ahead delineating its stackpay acreage in the delaware basin and reducing well cost which is relatively high at the moment the riskreward proposition is intriguing despite the big price move last week a case can be made that over time as and if the high quality of the underlying assets is fully demonstrated the market should be willing to award the stock with multiples more inline with the peer group and possibly attribute a scarcity premium for this “smallcap going to midcap” growth story halcón is in a great need of a multiple expansion as premiumpriced equity is a critical element of any ma growth strategy in the permian at the moment i would argue that halcón’s stock lacks the valuation advantage and needs to reprice materially higher to be an effective valuecreating tool in acquisitions this is a key challenge that halcón needs to overcome in the near term a path to such upward repricing does exist however based on my review of offset operator results in pecos county which are quite impressive i believe that multiple expansion is possible once halcón accumulates sufficient production history from its operated wells pro forma financial position on a pro forma basis as of march   halcón would have  million of longterm debt  bonds and  million in cash the table below some of the cash on balance sheet is already spoken for i assume the following outflows through the end of this year  million tax payments related to the transaction  million of professional fees expenses and debt repayment premia  million outspending from the end of q through yearend based on these assumptions halcón would arrive at yearend with  million of cash on balance sheet based on my estimate assuming halcón reserves  million for outspending under its  operating plan the company would have  million in cash available for acquisitions assuming some equity will be used as consideration or funding halcón can pursue a relatively large acquisition valuation on a net diluted basis the companys current share count is  million shares using the closing price of  per share on july   enterprise value is  million which i calculate as equity market value plus pro forma net debt plus assumed tax leakage transaction costs and debt repayment premia on the asset side halcón has  net acres in the delaware basin that the company has accumulated for a total consideration of  billion including existing production i estimate average price paid per undeveloped acre at  in addition i value the company’s retained nonoperated properties in the bakken at  million  net acres and  boed of production in second quarter and other properties for illustration at  million in other words halcón’s stock currently reflects a discount to the price the company has paid for the underlying assets in recent transactions what is missing in this picture is a valuation premium to the private market value of acreage which in case of several leading permianfocused operators is quite significant if i were to use parsley energy pe as an illustrative example the companys enterprise value is  billion i estimate the value of parsleys existing production and mineral acreage at  billion if i were to assume that  of the companys acreage is tier  valued at  per acre the valuation for the remaining acreage implied by the current stock price is  per acre roughly two times higher than the peracre valuation implied by halcons stock price i should note that parleys peracre trading multiple is not the highest in the peer group operating guidance pro forma for the asset sale halcóns current net production is approximately  boed of which  boed come from the retained nonoperated bakken properties the company plans to continue to run  rigs in the delaware basin for the remainder of  and has issued  exit production guidance of  boed on the conference call the company’s ceo floyd wilson indicated that this guidance is conservative  exit production has a good chance of exceeding  boed in the current quarter halcón plans to complete and turn in line the first seven of its operated wells in pecos county all of which are ft laterals with one of the rigs moving to ward county soon the company should also have some ward county well results to report by yearend halcón is currently running one completion fleet with  highvolume jobs pumped per month on the conference call halcón noted strong cost inflation on the completion side the afe for a typical ft well is currently running close to  million which reflects in part the enhanced completion formula being used by the company with  lbs proppant loadings per lateral foot the company is planning to add one more rig at yearend in my estimate a threerig program in  would require a budget in the  million range including infrastructure buildout based on my estimate and assuming well productivity lives up to expectation a threerig program can yield a  exit production in the  boed range with high oil content halcón stated that it would consider a fourrig program if oil prices cooperate of note the company believes that a tworig program should be sufficient to meet acreage retention obligations in the second half of this year halcón is strongly overhedged with  barrels of oil per day protected with nymex collars with floor prices of  per barrel for  the company’s hedge position currently covers  barrels of oil per day with a similar floor price natural gas hedges are also meaningful and are currently in the money i expect halcón to add substantial hedges for  in the near term source halcón resources june   in summary halcón’s operating plan for the next  months is fully funded and reasonably well protected with hedges the company should be able to post strong production growth fueled by outspending with production potentially reaching as high as  boed by the end of  as more well results are established and production ramps up the discount associated with halcón’s current de facto “acreage holding company” status should be eliminated assets source halcón resources june   well results will be the ultimate driver of halcón’s stock price performance in pecos county early indications – based both on prior operator’s results and offset operator activity – are quite encouraging halcón’s acreage in pecos county is offset by acreage blocks recently purchased by diamondback energy fang in the brigham acquisition and occidental petroleum oxy in the j cleo acquisition well results in the wolfcamp on both diamondback’s and oxy’s blocks have been strong based on my review of well performance i am particularly impressed with the relatively shallow production declines source halcón resources june   the most important question relates to the size of the toptier inventory yielded by halcón’s acreage the company estimates that it has  drilling locations in primary target zones across its pecos county and ward county acreage the estimate assumes  wells per drilling unit in each the wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b and  wells per drilling unit in the st bone spring the slide below even if i were to “haircut” this inventory assumption by  and assume ft average lateral length the risked core inventory would represent a roughly  billion coreofthecore investment opportunity for halcón equal to eight years of development based on  million annual dc budget in addition the company would have a massive tier  drilling inventory in the backlog i view this illustrative risked estimate for the coreofthecore inventory as conservative source halcón resources june   due to the rampant supply chain inflation increasing well costs will be a concern for the entire industry with thresholds for profitable growth increasing significantly going into  still halcón estimates that it can generate a compelling rate of return at the well level in the wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b at wti prices as low as  per barrel assuming  million well cost let’s make no mistake a  per barrel oil price environment would present major economic challenges for the entire industry halcón would be no exception in this regard however it is comforting to see that the survival threshold and organic growth threshold for the new portfolio have improved materially relative to the company’s previous asset base a much stronger liquidity position is also a significant plus source halcón resources june   i should also note that halcón’s well costs are likely to evolve over time it is natural for an operator in a new area to maximize completion intensity in order to discover – and demonstrate to the market – the acreage’s full productive potential over time completions and landing zones will be optimized to achieve the highest economic return whereas the transition to full development mode with multiwell pads will produce significant operational savings it would not be surprising to see well costs drop by as much as onequarter and well results improve on average redefining the economic threshold for profitable development halcón’s acreage block in pecos county is the most derisked however based on offset operator results the company’s less proven ward county acreage also appears quite interesting and should not be prematurely placed into the tier  bucket source halcón resources june   due to the block’s contiguous geometry most of it can be developed using ft laterals yielding cost efficiencies source halcón resources june   offset operator well performance it would be incorrect to extrapolate operational results demonstrated by offset operators onto halcons acreage each acreage block and each zone need to be proven independently as even several miles can matter to well performance operational skill and cost control also matter a lot and can vary team to team that said operational results reported to date by diamondback and oxy in pecos county are quite encouraging below for your reference are several slides from diamondbacks and oxys recent presentations highlighting well results and operational progress by these areas on adjacent acreage please note that diamondback and oxy have normalized well performance to ft laterals i encourage readers to conduct their own independent well performance due diligence given the importance of this specific factor source diamondback energy may  source occidental petroleum june  upside potential there are two major catalysts on the horizon for halcón the first catalyst relates to well performance in pecos county halcón will discuss its first operated ip rate on is q conference call on august  a plethora of meaningful earlytime performance data should be available by the time of the q conference call in early november however i expect the greatest impact in this regard to come from diamondbacks q conference call given that diamondbacks operation in this area is better established i expect the update to be substantial and deliver interesting operational details potentially with a positive readacross to halcón if halcón manages to surprise with abovetypecurve well results – based on its own wells and offset operator data  the stock can reprice higher and begin reflecting some premium to the acquisition cost of the acreage i see this operational outcome as a reasonable possibility given the highintensity completions being used by the company and taking in consideration strong results to date by offset operators the second catalyst relates to a possible acreage acquisition growth through acreage capture is in halcón’s dna and i reiterate my strong view should be expected given the spare cash the company now has i anticipate that halcón will not wait long to announce its next initiative if both catalysts play out favorably i can see the stock price moving materially higher from the current level assuming no decline in the oil futures curve  wti strip is trading at  per barrel at the time of this writing an increase to an implied peracre valuation of  would correspond a  increase in the stock price before any value accretion from future acquisitions downside risk let’s make no mistake halcón is a shale exploration stock and there are significant operational and financial risks associated with shale exploration there is no doubt that the company’s acreage is highly prospective in many zones and prolific at least in some zones however economic returns by area and by zone need to be demonstrated furthermore returns will strongly depend on halcón’s ability to drive well costs down via technical learning and operational optimization given that the company has paid a significant amount of cash upfront for the acreage the bar for well productivity and cost reductions is set quite high macro risks are also significant all shale operators are at the mercy of oil prices an oil price correction even if shortlived can decimate stock prices no matter how attractive the operating story might be smallcapitalization stocks with shallow public float are particularly susceptible to wide price swings with forced position liquidations begetting a vicious cycle of additional liquidations halcón’s stock certainly belongs in that category even though the company’s risk profile improved significantly as a result of the williston basin divestiture acquisitions are a significant component of the stocks upside and could add materially to value that said acquisitions obviously contain risk a large acquisition would require significant equity issuance in the absence of an upward stock repricing an equityfunded acquisition can be challenging from a value creation perspective in conclusion… halcón represents an intriguing highriskhighreward permian pure play priced attractively relative to peers i anticipate the company’s complexion to change significantly within a year with production and asset base growing rapidly under an optimistic operating scenario strong well results plus a smart acquisition i can see the stock price increasing over  within  months assuming no change in the oil futures curve well performance data and acreage acquisitions are catalysts that have the power to reprice the stock materially higher
