york may   globe newswire  genco shipping  trading limited nysegnk genco or the company today reported its financial results for the three months ended march   the following financial review discusses the results for the three months ended march   and march   first quarter  and yeartodate highlights recorded a net loss of  million for the first quarter of basic and diluted loss per share of  adjusted basic and diluted loss of  million or  per share excluding  million for gain on sale of vessels during the first quarter of  we delivered four vessels to buyerssold the genco wisdom the genco carrier the genco reliance and the genco success for total net proceeds of  million which were recorded as cash on the balance sheet expect to sell the genco prosperity the last of the ten vessels identified for sale for total net proceeds of  millionanticipate the vessel to be delivered to buyers by may   and net proceeds to be recorded as cash on the balance sheet     we believe the nongaap measure presented provides investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding the companys operating performance financial review  first quarter the company recorded a net loss for the first quarter of  of  million or  basic and diluted net loss per share comparatively for the three months ended march   the company recorded a net loss of  million or  basic and diluted net loss per share basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended march   has been adjusted for the oneforten reverse stock split of gencos common stock effected on july   john c wobensmith chief executive officer commented during the first quarter our focus remained on further enhancing the companys commercial strategy and advancing gencos position as a leading lowcost operator specifically we have taken steps during the quarter to strengthen our chartering team to further enhance our commercial prospects focusing on both major and minor bulks improve the age profile of our fleet and maintain a low breakeven level as supply and demand fundamentals continue to come into balance we believe genco is well positioned to take advantage of a market recovery due to our improved platform and significant operating leverage our financial flexibility also provides the company the potential to pursue compelling growth opportunities for shareholders the companys revenues increased to  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   the increase was primarily due to higher spot market rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the first quarter of  versus the same period last year partially offset by the operation of fewer vessels during the first quarter of  as compared to the first quarter of  the average daily time charter equivalent or tce rates obtained by the companys fleet was  per day for the three months ended march   as compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase in tce was primarily due to higher spot rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the first quarter of  versus the first quarter of  during january and february of  the drybulk market experienced various seasonal events that pressured freight rates including increased newbuilding vessel deliveries weather related disruptions and the chinese new year holiday in march however freight rates found support led by heightened chinese demand for iron ore cargoes particularly from brazil due to augmented chinese steel production increased coal shipments to china as well as the onset of the south american grain season specifically on march   the bdi reached a yeartodate high of  with capesize freight rates as quoted by the baltic exchange trading significantly higher than the same point of last year total operating expenses were  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   vessel operating expenses declined to  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   this decrease was primarily due to the operation of fewer vessels during the first quarter of  as compared to the same period of the prior year this decrease was also due to lower expenses related to crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares partially offset by higher drydocking related expenses general and administrative expenses were  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the first quarter of  primarily due to a decrease in noncash compensation expenses included in general and administrative expenses is nonvested stock amortization expense of  million and  million for the first quarter of  and  respectively depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the three months ended march   primarily due to the revaluation of ten of our vessels to their estimated net realizable value during the first half of  daily vessel operating expenses or dvoe decreased to  per vessel per day for the first quarter of  compared to  per vessel per day for the same quarter of  predominantly due to lower expenses related to crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares partially offset by higher drydocking related expenses we believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a ‑month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation furthermore based on estimates provided by our technical managers and managements views our dvoe budget for  is  per vessel per day on a weighted average basis for the entire year for the core fleet of  vessels apostolos zafolias chief financial officer commented genco continues to maintain a strong financial foundation ending the first quarter with  million in cash our continued focus on costsaving initiatives has enabled genco to significantly lower its cash breakeven levels which are among the lowest in the industry we believe our lowcost structure as well as our significant liquidity position will serve the company well in a drybulk recovery liquidity and capital resources cash flow net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively  included in the net loss during the three months ended march   are  million of noncash impairment charges also included in the net loss during the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively of noncash amortization of nonvested stock compensation related to gencos  management incentive plan there was also a gain on sale of vessels in the amount of  million due to the sale of four vessels and paid in kind interest of  million related to the  million credit facility during the three months ended march   depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  million due to the sale or scrapping of nine vessels during the nine months ended december   and the three months ended march    additionally the fluctuation in prepaid expense and other current assets decreased by  million due to the timing of prepaid payments made  lastly there was a  million increase in deferred drydocking costs incurred because there were more vessels that completed drydocking during the three months ended march   as compared to the same period during  net cash provided by investing activities was  million during the three months ended march   as compared to  million during the three months ended march    the increase is primarily due to  million of proceeds from the sale of four vessels during the three months ended march   additionally there was a decrease in deposits of restricted cash during the three months ended march   as a result of the release of  million of restricted cash for required capital expenditures for our vessels  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  million for the proceeds from the sale of availableforsale securities  net cash used in financing activities was  million and  million during the three months ended march   and  respectively net cash used in financing activities of  million for the three months ended march   consisted primarily of the following  million payment of series a preferred stock issuance costs  million repayment of debt under the  term loan facilities and  million repayment of debt under the  million credit facility  net cash used in financing activities of  million for the three months ended march   consisted primarily of the following  million repayment of debt under the  million term loan facility  million repayment of debt

refinanced the following six credit facilities the  million term loan facility the  million credit facility the  million term loan facility the  revolving credit facility the  million term loan facility and the  million term loan facility capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with vessel acquisitions as of may   our fleet consists of  capesize six panamax four ultramax  supramax two handymax and  handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately  dwt   in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet six of our vessels were drydocked during the first quarter of  we currently expect nine of our vessels to be drydocked during the remainder of  of which six are expected to be drydocked during the second quarter of  we estimate our capital expenditures related to drydocking for our fleet through  to be   q  qq  estimated costs   million  million estimated offhire days     estimates are based on our budgeted cost of drydocking our vessels in china actual costs will vary based on various factors including where the drydockings are actually performed we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations these costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses or potential costs associated with the installation of ballast water treatment systems  actual length will vary based on the condition of the vessel yard schedules and other factors six vessels drydocked during the first quarter of  the planned offhire days recorded for these vessels during the first quarter of  amounted to  days capitalized costs associated with drydocking incurred during the first

by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance ebitda is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers our management uses ebitda as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings for these reasons we believe that ebitda is a useful measure to present to our investors ebitda is not an item recognized by us gaap ie nongaap measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other indicator of a companys operating performance required by us gaap ebitda is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are offhire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels between time charters companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are offhire due to unforeseen circumstances the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a companys efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are offhire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades special surveys or vessel positioning we define tce rates as our net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses including voyage expenses to parent divided by the number of our available days during the period which is consistent with industry standards tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in perday amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs the cost of insurance expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking the costs of spares and consumable stores tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period genco shipping  trading limiteds fleet genco shipping  trading limited transports iron ore coal grain steel products and

and significant relief under the collateral maintenance covenants which is expected to provide the company with increased financial flexibility upon closing  the commitment for the proposed  million credit facility highlights the companys industry leadership and is expected to better position the company to capitalize on our leading drybulk platform during a potential market recovery we thank our lenders for their strong and ongoing support the companys revenues decreased to  million for the three months ended september   compared to  million for the three months ended september   the decrease was primarily due to lower spot market rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the third quarter of  versus the same period last year the average daily time charter equivalent or tce rates obtained by the companys fleet was  per day for the three months ended september   as compared to  for the three months ended september   the decrease in tce was primarily due to lower spot rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the third quarter of  versus the third quarter of  during the third quarter of  the baltic dry index continued to increase from alltime lows registered earlier in the year freight rates during the quarter were primarily supported by heightened demand for iron ore cargoes due to augmented chinese steel production

to lower expenses related to maintenance crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares general administrative and technical management expenses were  million for the third quarter of  compared to  million for the third quarter of  primarily due to a decrease in compensation and merger related expenses partially offset by costs related to financing or refinancing activities included in general administrative and technical management expenses for the three months ended september   and the three months ended september   are noncash compensation expenses of  million and  million respectively arising from awards under the  equity incentive plan and the  management incentive plan or mip depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to  million for the three months ended september   from  million for the three months ended september   primarily due to the revaluation of ten of our vessels to their estimated net realizable value during the first half of  daily vessel operating expenses or dvoe decreased to  per vessel per day for the third quarter of  compared to  per vessel per day for the same quarter of  predominantly due to lower expenses related to maintenance crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares we believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a ‑month

financial statements of genco under us gaap changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent losing control of the subsidiary are considered equity transactions ie transactions with owners in their capacity as owners with any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid attributed to the equity of the parent accordingly upon completion of the merger any difference between the fair value of the genco common shares issued in exchange for baltic trading common shares was reflected as an adjustment to the equity in genco no gain or loss was reorganized in gencos consolidated statement of comprehensive income upon completion of the transaction summary consolidated financial and

measure to compare results across peers our management uses ebitda as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings for these reasons we believe that ebitda is a useful measure to present to our investors ebitda is not an item recognized by us gaap ie nongaap measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other indicator of a companys operating performance required by us gaap ebitda is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies pursuant to the amendments entered into on april   for our  million term loan facility and our  million term loan facility the definition of consolidated ebitda used in the financial covenants has been eliminated   average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period   we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period   we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are offhire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels between time charters companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues   we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are offhire due to unforeseen circumstances the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues   we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a companys efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are offhire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades special surveys or vessel positioning   we define tce rates as our net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses including voyage expenses to parent divided by the number of our available days during the period which is consistent with industry standards tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in perday amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts   we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs the cost of insurance expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking the costs of spares and consumable stores tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period genco shipping  trading limiteds fleet genco

capesize eight panamax four ultramax  supramax five handymax and  handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately  dwt our current fleet contains  groups of sister ships which are
