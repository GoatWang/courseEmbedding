securitization in international relations see securitization international relations securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages commercial mortgages auto loans or credit card debt obligations or other nondebt assets which generate receivables and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities which may be described as bonds passthrough securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgagebacked securities mbs while those backed by other types of receivables are assetbacked securities abs critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risk and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition offbalance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide the extent of leverage of the securitizing firm thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an underpricing of credit risk offbalance sheet securitizations also played a large role in the high leverage level of us financial institutions before the financial crisis and the need for bailouts the granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers unlike general corporate debt the credit quality of securitized debt is nonstationary due to changes in volatility that are time and structuredependent if the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves if improperly structured the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late th century to an estimated outstanding of  trillion in the united states and  trillion in europe as of the nd quarter of  in  abs issuance amounted to  trillion in the us and  billion in europe wbs whole business securitization arrangements

originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal this is typically a company looking to either raise capital restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt consumer or otherwise for the purpose of subsequent securitization under traditional corporate finance concepts such a company would have three options to raise new capital a loan bond issue or issuance of stock however stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates the consistently revenuegenerating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole for instance a leasing company may have provided m nominal value of leases and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these it cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required if it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today in effect receiving today the present value of a future cash flow where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets a suitably large portfolio of assets is pooled and transferred to a special purpose vehicle or spv the issuer a taxexempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets once the assets are transferred to the issuer there is normally no recourse to the originator the issuer is bankruptcy remote meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator in order to achieve this the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities many issuers are typically orphaned in the case of certain assets such as credit card debt where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables a trust in favor of the spv may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment see the outline of the master trust structure below accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale a financing a partial sale or a partsale and partfinancing in a true sale the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet in a financing the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator under us accounting standards the originator achieves a sale by being at arms length from the issuer in which case the issuer is classified as a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe because of these structural issues the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank the arranger in setting up the structure of the transaction issuanceedit to be able to buy the assets from the originator the issuer spv issues tradable securities to fund the purchase investors purchase the securities either through a private offering targeting institutional investors or on the open market the performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision in transactions with static assets a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors the depositor has taken on added significance under regulation ab the depositor typically owns  of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction in transactions with managed traded assets asset managers assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors some deals may include a thirdparty guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets the principal and the interest payments for a fee the securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system fixed rate abs set the “coupon” rate at the time of issuance in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and tbills floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and nonamortizing assets in the floating market in contrast to fixed rate securities the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a us treasury rate or more typically the london interbank offered rate libor the floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk credit enhancement and tranchingedit unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured securities created in a securitization are credit enhanced meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originators unsecured debt or underlying asset pool this increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties such as surety bonds and parental guarantees although this may introduce a conflict of interest the issued securities are often split into tranches or categorized into varying degrees of subordination each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure there is generally a senior a class of securities and one or more junior subordinated b c etc classes that function as protective layers for the a class the senior classes have first claim on the cash that the spv receives and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid because of the cascading effect between classes this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall if the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities eg when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches and the upperlevel tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches the senior securities might be aaa or aa rated signifying a lower risk while the lowercredit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating signifying a higher risk the most junior class often called the equity class is the most exposed to payment risk in some cases this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow in some cases the equity class receives no coupon either fixed or floating but only the residual cash flow if any after all the other classes have been paid there may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets this is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which in essence are repaid whenever the properties are sold since any early repayments are passed on to this class it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow if the underlying assets are mortgages or loans there are usually two separate waterfalls because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched but if the assets are incomebased transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment in this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive in addition to subordination credit may be enhanced through a reserve or spread account in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments chargeoffs and other fees have been paidoff are accumulated and can be used when spe expenses are greater than its income thirdparty insurance or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities overcollateralisation usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected cash funding or a cash collateral account generally consisting of shortterm highly rated investments purchased either from the sellers own funds or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows a thirdparty letter of credit or corporate guarantee a backup servicer for the loans discounted receivables for the pool servicingedit a servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal the servicer can often be the originator because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the special purpose vehicle the servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy which influences the proceeds collected the chargeoffs and the recoveries on the loans any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account and any further excess is returned to the seller bond rating agencies publish ratings of assetbacked securities based on the performance of the collateral pool the credit enhancements and the probability of default when the issuer is structured as a trust the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gatekeeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer even though the trustee is part of the spv which is typically wholly owned by the originator the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets typically the investors repayment structuresedit unlike corporate bonds most securitizations are amortized meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets such as home equity loans auto loans and student loans prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing abs the possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity the psa prepayment model is a wellknown example a controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising after a predetermined revolving period during which only interest payments are made these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments usually within a year an early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early on the other hand bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment the most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date however the majority of these securitizations are paid on time the second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity this means that the first tranche which may have a oneyear average life will receive all principal payments until it is retired then the second tranche begins to receive principal and so forth pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security structural risks and misincentivesedit some originators eg of mortgages have prioritised loan volume over credit quality disregarding the longterm risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization other originators aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation have paid more attention to credit qualitycitation needed special types of securitizationedit master trustedit a master trust is a type of spv particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times in a typical master trust transaction an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables after this transaction typically the originator would continue to service the receivables in this case the credit cards there are various risks involved with master trusts specifically one risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables for example credit cardbacked securities can have maturities of up to  years but credit cardbacked receivables usually pay off much more quickly to solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period an accumulation period and an amortization period all three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables during the revolving period principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables during the accumulation period these payments are accumulated in a separate account during the amortization period new payments are passed through to the investors a second risk is that the total investor interests and the sellers interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards but the seller originator owns the accounts this can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts typically to solve this there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables a third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and undercollateralize total investor interest to prevent this often there is a required minimum sellers interest and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur issuance trustedit in  citibank introduced a new structure for credit cardbacked securities called an issuance trust which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche there are other benefits to an issuance trust they provide more flexibility in issuing seniorsubordinate securities can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investmentgrade securities issued by them and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities because of these issues issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit cardbacked securities grantor trustedit grantor trusts are typically used in automobilebacked securities and remics real estate mortgage investment conduits grantor trusts are very similar to passthrough trusts used in the earlier days of securitization an originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust which issues classes of securities backed by these loans principal and interest received on the loans after expenses are taken into account are passed through to the holders of the securities on a prorata basis owner trustedit in an owner trust there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities in an owner trust both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities due to this owner trusts can tailor maturity risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs usually any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that all income is returned to the seller owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by overcollateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal which leaves more collateral for the other classes motives for securitizationedit advantages to issueredit reduces funding costs through securitization a company rated bb but with aaa worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly aaa rates this is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs the difference between bb debt and aaa debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points for example moodys downgraded ford motor credits rating in january  but senior automobile backed securities issued by ford motor credit in january  and april  continue to be rated aaa because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements reduces assetliability mismatch depending on the structure chosen securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis essentially in most banks and finance companies the liability book or the funding is from borrowings this often comes at a high cost securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a selffunded asset book lower capital requirements some firms due to legal regulatory or other reasons have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be by securitizing some of their assets which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the earning power of the assets locking in profits for a given block of business the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain once the block has been securitized the level of profits has now been locked in for that company thus the risk of profit not emerging or the benefit of superprofits has now been passed on transfer risks credit liquidity prepayment reinvestment asset concentration securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it to one that does two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and entertainment securitizations similarly by securitizing a block of business thereby locking in a degree of profits the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business off balance sheet derivative finance of many types have in the past been referred to as offbalancesheet this term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact while there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet there is also a generally accepted principle that where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gainloss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities certain credit derivatives products particularly credit default swaps now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation in the case of credit default swaps this documentation has been formulated by the international swaps and derivatives association isda who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets earnings securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm when a securitization takes place there often is a true sale that takes place between the originator the parent company and the spe this sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the true sale to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent companys balance sheet which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale while not illegal in any respect this does distort the true earnings of the parent company admissibility future cashflows may not get full credit in a companys accounts life insurance companies for example may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset liquidity future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending whereas once the book has been securitized the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment this also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates disadvantages to issueredit may reduce portfolio quality if the aaa risks for example are being securitized out this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk costs securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs legal fees underwriting fees rating fees and ongoing administration an allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations especially if it is an atypical securitization size limitations securitizations often require large scale structuring and thus may not be costefficient for small and medium transactions risks since securitization is a structured transaction it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment such as prepayment as well as credit loss especially for structures where there are some retained strips advantages to investorsedit opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return on a riskadjusted basis opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets due to the stringent requirements for corporations for example to attain high ratings there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist securitizations however allow for the creation of large quantities of aaa aa or a rated bonds and risk averse institutional investors or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets have access to a larger pool of investment options portfolio diversification depending on the securitization hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities isolation of credit risk from the parent entity since the assets that are securitized are isolated at least in theory from the assets of the originating entity under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the parent because the underlying risks are different for example a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest or just as likely the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors and hence less profitable risks to investorsedit liquidity risk creditdefault default risk is generally accepted as a borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time for abs default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus a key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating different tranches within the abs are rated differently with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings almost all mortgages including reverse mortgages and student loans are now insured by the government meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively overinflated in other words there are no limits or curbs on overspending or the liabilities to taxpayers however the credit crisis of – has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization which doesnt encourage improvement of underwriting standards event risk prepaymentreinvestmentearly amortization the majority of revolving abs are subject to some degree of early amortization risk the risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely typically payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers insufficient excess spread a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer currency interest rate fluctuations like all fixed income securities the prices of fixed rate abs move in response to changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate abs prices less than fixed rate securities as the index against which the abs rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy furthermore interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of abs which can affect yields home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates while auto loans student loans and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates contractual agreements moral hazard investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations’ underlying assets if the manager earns fees based on performance there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deals excess spread servicer risk the transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent this risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction historyedit early developmentsedit see also economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic modern practice of securitization has its roots in the thcentury dutch republic examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the th century among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  in february  the us department of housing and urban development created the first modern residential mortgagebacked security the government national mortgage association gnma or ginnie mae sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans to facilitate the securitization of nonmortgage assets businesses substituted private credit enhancements first they overcollateralised pools of assets shortly thereafter they improved thirdparty and structural enhancements in  securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of nonmortgage assets — automobile loans a pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume auto loans were a good match for structured finance their maturities considerably shorter than those of mortgages made the timing of cash flows more predictable and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence this early auto loan deal was a  million securitization originated by marine midland bank and securitised in  by the certificate for automobile receivables trust cars  the first significant bank credit card sale came to market in  with a private placement of  million of outstanding bank card loans this transaction demonstrated to investors that if the yields were high enough loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes easing balance sheet and capital constraints while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees after the success of this initial transaction investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows starting in the s with some earlier private transactions securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe this activity grew to nearly bn of issuance in  following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by hurricane katrina and regulation xxx key areas of activity in the broad area of alternative risk transfer include catastrophe bonds life insurance securitization and reinsurance sidecars the first public securitization of community reinvestment act cra loans started in  cra loans are loans targeted to low and moderate income borrowers and neighborhoods as estimated by the bond market association in the united states the total amount outstandingclarification needed at the end of  was  trillion this amount was about  percent of total outstanding bond market debt  trillion about  percent of mortgagerelated debt  trillion and about  percent of corporate debt  trillion in the united states in nominal terms over the previous ten years – absclarification needed amount outstanding had grown about  percent annually with mortgagerelated debt and corporate debt each growing at about  percent gross public issuance of assetbacked securities was strong setting new records in many years in  issuance was at an alltime record of about  trillion at the end of  the larger sectors of this market were credit cardbacked securities  percent homeequity backed securities  percent automobilebacked securities  percent and collateralized debt obligations  percent among the other market segments were student loanbacked securities  percent equipment leases  percent manufactured housing  percent small business loans such as loans to convenience stores and gas stations and aircraft leases modern securitization took off in the late s or early s thanks to the innovative structures implemented across the asset classes such as uk mortgage master trusts concept imported from the us credit cards insurancebacked transaction such as those implemented by the insurance securitization guru emmanuel issanchou or even more esoteric asset classes for example securitization of lottery receivables as the result of the credit crunch precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis the us market for bonds backed by securitised loans was very weak in  except for bonds guaranteed by a federally backed agency as a result interest rates rose for loans that were previously securitised such as home mortgages student loans auto loans and commercial mortgages recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects for example solarcity offered the first us assetbacked security in the solar industry in  recent lawsuitsedit recently there have been several lawsuits attributable to the rating of securitizations by the three leading rating agencies in july  the usa’s

encyclopedia jump to navigation search for securitization in international relations see securitization international relations securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages commercial mortgages auto loans or credit card debt obligations or other nondebt assets which generate receivables and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities which may be described as bonds passthrough securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgagebacked securities mbs while those backed by other types of receivables are assetbacked securities abs critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risk and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition offbalance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide the extent of leverage of the securitizing firm thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an underpricing of credit risk offbalance sheet securitizations also played a large role in the high leverage level of us financial institutions before the financial crisis and the need for bailouts the granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers unlike general corporate debt the credit quality of securitized debt is nonstationary due to changes in volatility that are time and structuredependent if the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves if improperly structured the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late th century to an estimated outstanding of  trillion in the united states and  trillion in europe as of the nd quarter of  in  abs issuance amounted to  trillion in the us and  billion in europe wbs whole business securitization arrangements first appeared in the united kingdom in the s and became common in various commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent

links structureedit pooling and transferedit the originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal this is typically a company looking to either raise capital restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt consumer or otherwise for the purpose of subsequent securitization under traditional corporate finance concepts such a company would have three options to raise new capital a loan bond issue or issuance of stock however stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates the consistently revenuegenerating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole for instance a leasing company may have provided m nominal value of leases and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these it cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required if it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today in effect receiving today the present value of a future cash flow where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets a suitably large portfolio of assets is pooled and transferred to a special purpose vehicle or spv the issuer a taxexempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets once the assets are transferred to the issuer there is normally no recourse to the originator the issuer is bankruptcy remote meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator in order to achieve this the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities many issuers are typically orphaned in the case of certain assets such as credit card debt where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables a trust in favor of the spv may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment see the outline of the master trust structure below accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale a financing a partial sale or a partsale and partfinancing in a true sale the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet in a financing the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator under us accounting standards the originator achieves a sale by being at arms length from the issuer in which case the issuer is classified as a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe because of these structural issues the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank the arranger in setting up the structure of the transaction issuanceedit to be able to buy the assets from the originator the issuer spv issues tradable securities to fund the purchase investors purchase the securities either through a private offering targeting institutional investors or on the open market the performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision in transactions with static assets a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors the depositor has taken on added significance under regulation ab the depositor typically owns  of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction in transactions with managed traded assets asset managers assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors some deals may include a thirdparty guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets the principal and the interest payments for a fee the securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system fixed rate abs set the “coupon” rate at the time of issuance in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and tbills floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and nonamortizing assets in the floating market in contrast to fixed rate securities the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a us treasury rate or more typically the london interbank offered rate libor the floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk credit enhancement and tranchingedit unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured securities created in a securitization are credit enhanced meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originators unsecured debt or underlying asset pool this increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties such as surety bonds and parental guarantees although this may introduce a conflict of interest the issued securities are often split into tranches or categorized into varying degrees of subordination each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure there is generally a senior a class of securities and one or more junior subordinated b c etc classes that function as protective layers for the a class the senior classes have first claim on the cash that the spv receives and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid because of the cascading effect between classes this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall if the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities eg when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches and the upperlevel tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches the senior securities might be aaa or aa rated signifying a lower risk while the lowercredit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating signifying a higher risk the most junior class often called the equity class is the most exposed to payment risk in some cases this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow in some cases the equity class receives no coupon either fixed or floating but only the residual cash flow if any after all the other classes have been paid there may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets this is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which in essence are repaid whenever the properties are sold since any early repayments are passed on to this class it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow if the underlying assets are mortgages or loans there are usually two separate waterfalls because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched but if the assets are incomebased transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment in this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive in addition to subordination credit may be enhanced through a reserve or spread account in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments chargeoffs and other fees have been paidoff are accumulated and can be used when spe expenses are greater than its income thirdparty insurance or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities overcollateralisation usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected cash funding or a cash collateral account generally consisting of shortterm highly rated investments purchased either from the sellers own funds or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows a thirdparty letter of credit or corporate guarantee a backup servicer for the loans discounted receivables for the pool servicingedit a servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal the servicer can often be the originator because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the special purpose vehicle the servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy which influences the proceeds collected the chargeoffs and the recoveries on the loans any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account and any further excess is returned to the seller bond rating agencies publish ratings of assetbacked securities based on the performance of the collateral pool the credit enhancements and the probability of default when the issuer is structured as a trust the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gatekeeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer even though the trustee is part of the spv which is typically wholly owned by the originator the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets typically the investors repayment structuresedit unlike corporate bonds most securitizations are amortized meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets such as home equity loans auto loans and student loans prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing abs the possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity the psa prepayment model is a wellknown example a controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising after a predetermined revolving period during which only interest payments are made these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments usually within a year an early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early on the other hand bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment the most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date however the majority of these securitizations are paid on time the second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity this means that the first tranche which may have a oneyear average life will receive all principal payments until it is retired then the second tranche begins to receive principal and so forth pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security structural risks and misincentivesedit some originators eg of mortgages have prioritised loan volume over credit quality disregarding the longterm risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization other originators aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation have paid more attention to credit qualitycitation needed special types of securitizationedit master trustedit a master trust is a type of spv particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times in a typical master trust transaction an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables after this transaction typically the originator would continue to service the receivables in this case the credit cards there are various risks involved with master trusts specifically one risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables for example credit cardbacked securities can have maturities of up to  years but credit cardbacked receivables usually pay off much more quickly to solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period an accumulation period and an amortization period all three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables during the revolving period principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables during the accumulation period these payments are accumulated in a separate account during the amortization period new payments are passed through to the investors a second risk is that the total investor interests and the sellers interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards but the seller originator owns the accounts this can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts typically to solve this there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables a third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and undercollateralize total investor interest to prevent this often there is a required minimum sellers interest and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur issuance trustedit in  citibank introduced a new structure for credit cardbacked securities called an issuance trust which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche there are other benefits to an issuance trust they provide more flexibility in issuing seniorsubordinate securities can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investmentgrade securities issued by them and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities because of these issues issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit cardbacked securities grantor trustedit grantor trusts are typically used in automobilebacked securities and remics real estate mortgage investment conduits grantor trusts are very similar to passthrough trusts used in the earlier days of securitization an originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust which issues classes of securities backed by these loans principal and interest received on the loans after expenses are taken into account are passed through to the holders of the securities on a prorata basis owner trustedit in an owner trust there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities in an owner trust both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities due to this owner trusts can tailor maturity risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs usually any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that all income is returned to the seller owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by overcollateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal which leaves more collateral for the other classes motives for securitizationedit advantages to issueredit reduces funding costs through securitization a company rated bb but with aaa worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly aaa rates this is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs the difference between bb debt and aaa debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points for example moodys downgraded ford motor credits rating in january  but senior automobile backed securities issued by ford motor credit in january  and april  continue to be rated aaa because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements reduces assetliability mismatch depending on the structure chosen securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis essentially in most banks and finance companies the liability book or the funding is from borrowings this often comes at a high cost securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a selffunded asset book lower capital requirements some firms due to legal regulatory or other reasons have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be by securitizing some of their assets which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the earning power of the assets locking in profits for a given block of business the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain once the block has been securitized the level of profits has now been locked in for that company thus the risk of profit not emerging or the benefit of superprofits has now been passed on transfer risks credit liquidity prepayment reinvestment asset concentration securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it to one that does two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and entertainment securitizations similarly by securitizing a block of business thereby locking in a degree of profits the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business off balance sheet derivative finance of many types have in the past been referred to as offbalancesheet this term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact while there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet there is also a generally accepted principle that where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gainloss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities certain credit derivatives products particularly credit default swaps now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation in the case of credit default swaps this documentation has been formulated by the international swaps and derivatives association isda who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets earnings securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm when a securitization takes place there often is a true sale that takes place between the originator the parent company and the spe this sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the true sale to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent companys balance sheet which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale while not illegal in any respect this does distort the true earnings of the parent company admissibility future cashflows may not get full credit in a companys accounts life insurance companies for example may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset liquidity future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending whereas once the book has been securitized the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment this also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates disadvantages to issueredit may reduce portfolio quality if the aaa risks for example are being securitized out this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk costs securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs legal fees underwriting fees rating fees and ongoing administration an allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations especially if it is an atypical securitization size limitations securitizations often require large scale structuring and thus may not be costefficient for small and medium transactions risks since securitization is a structured transaction it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment such as prepayment as well as credit loss especially for structures where there are some retained strips advantages to investorsedit opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return on a riskadjusted basis opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets due to the stringent requirements for corporations for example to attain high ratings there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist securitizations however allow for the creation of large quantities of aaa aa or a rated bonds and risk averse institutional investors or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets have access to a larger pool of investment options portfolio diversification depending on the securitization hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities isolation of credit risk from the parent entity since the assets that are securitized are isolated at least in theory from the assets of the originating entity under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the parent because the underlying risks are different for example a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest or just as likely the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors and hence less profitable risks to investorsedit liquidity risk creditdefault default risk is generally accepted as a borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time for abs default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus a key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating different tranches within the abs are rated differently with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings almost all mortgages including reverse mortgages and student loans are now insured by the government meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively overinflated in other words there are no limits or curbs on overspending or the liabilities to taxpayers however the credit crisis of – has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization which doesnt encourage improvement of underwriting standards event risk prepaymentreinvestmentearly amortization the majority of revolving abs are subject to some degree of early amortization risk the risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely typically payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers insufficient excess spread a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer currency interest rate fluctuations like all fixed income securities the prices of fixed rate abs move in response to changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate abs prices less than fixed rate securities as the index against which the abs rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy furthermore interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of abs which can affect yields home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates while auto loans student loans and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates contractual agreements moral hazard investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations’ underlying assets if the manager earns fees based on performance there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deals excess spread servicer risk the transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent this risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction historyedit early developmentsedit see also economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic modern practice of securitization has its roots in the thcentury dutch republic examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the th century among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  in february  the us department of housing and urban development created the first modern residential mortgagebacked security the government national mortgage association gnma or ginnie mae sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans to facilitate the securitization of nonmortgage assets businesses substituted private credit enhancements first they overcollateralised pools of assets shortly thereafter they improved thirdparty and structural enhancements in  securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of nonmortgage assets — automobile loans a pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume auto loans were a good match for structured finance their maturities considerably shorter than those of mortgages made the timing of cash flows more predictable and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence this early auto loan deal was a  million securitization originated by marine midland bank and securitised in  by the certificate for automobile receivables trust cars  the first significant bank credit card sale came to market in  with a private placement of  million of outstanding bank card loans this transaction demonstrated to investors that if the yields were high enough loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes easing balance sheet and capital constraints while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees after the success of this initial transaction investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows starting in the s with some earlier private transactions securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe this activity grew to nearly bn of issuance in  following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by hurricane katrina and regulation xxx key areas of activity in the broad area of alternative risk transfer include catastrophe bonds life insurance securitization and reinsurance sidecars the first public securitization of community reinvestment act cra loans started in  cra loans are loans targeted to low and moderate income borrowers and neighborhoods as estimated by the bond market association in the united states the total amount outstandingclarification needed at the end of  was  trillion this amount was about  percent of total outstanding bond market debt  trillion about  percent of mortgagerelated debt  trillion and about  percent of corporate debt  trillion in the united states in nominal terms over the previous ten years – absclarification needed amount outstanding had grown about  percent annually with mortgagerelated debt and corporate debt each growing at about  percent gross public issuance of assetbacked securities was strong setting new records in many years in  issuance was at an alltime record of about  trillion at the end of  the larger sectors of this market were credit cardbacked securities  percent homeequity backed securities  percent automobilebacked securities  percent and collateralized debt obligations  percent among the other market segments were student loanbacked securities  percent equipment leases  percent manufactured housing  percent small business loans such as loans to convenience stores and gas stations and aircraft leases modern securitization took off in the late s or early s thanks to the innovative structures implemented across the asset classes such as uk mortgage master trusts concept imported from the us credit cards insurancebacked transaction such as those implemented by the insurance securitization guru emmanuel issanchou or even more esoteric asset classes for example securitization of lottery receivables as the result of the credit crunch precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis the us market for bonds backed by securitised loans was very weak in  except for bonds guaranteed by a federally backed agency as a result interest rates rose for loans that were previously securitised such as home mortgages student loans auto loans and commercial mortgages recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects for example solarcity offered the first us assetbacked security in the solar industry in  recent lawsuitsedit recently there have been several lawsuits attributable to the rating of securitizations by the three leading rating agencies in july  the usa’s largest public pension fund has filed suit in california state court in connection with  billion in losses that it says were caused by “wildly inaccurate” credit ratings from the three leading ratings agencies see alsoedit collateralized debt obligation securitization vehicle for corporate debt securities

encyclopedia jump to navigation search for securitization in international relations see securitization international relations securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages commercial mortgages auto loans or credit card debt obligations or other nondebt assets which generate receivables and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities which may be described as bonds passthrough securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgagebacked securities mbs while those backed by other types of receivables are assetbacked securities abs critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risk and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition offbalance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide the extent of leverage of the securitizing firm thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an underpricing of credit risk offbalance sheet securitizations also played a large role in the high leverage level of us financial institutions before the financial crisis and the need for bailouts the granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers unlike general corporate debt the credit quality of securitized debt is nonstationary due to changes in volatility that are time and structuredependent if the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves if improperly structured the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late th century to an estimated outstanding of  trillion in the united states and  trillion in europe as of the nd quarter of  in  abs issuance amounted to  trillion in the us and  billion in europe wbs whole business securitization arrangements first appeared in the united kingdom in the s and became common in various commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent

motives for securitization  advantages to issuer  disadvantages to issuer  advantages to investors  risks to investors  history  early developments  recent lawsuits  see also  references  external links structureedit pooling and transferedit the originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal this is typically a company looking to either raise capital restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt consumer or otherwise for the purpose of subsequent securitization under traditional corporate finance concepts such a company would have three options to raise new capital a loan bond issue or issuance of stock however stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates the consistently revenuegenerating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole for instance a leasing company may have provided m nominal value of leases and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these it cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required if it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today in effect receiving today the present value of a future cash flow where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets a suitably large portfolio of assets is pooled and transferred to a special purpose vehicle or spv the issuer a taxexempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets once the assets are transferred to the issuer there is normally no recourse to the originator the issuer is bankruptcy remote meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator in order to achieve this the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities many issuers are typically orphaned in the case of certain assets such as credit card debt where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables a trust in favor of the spv may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment see the outline of the master trust structure below accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale a financing a partial sale or a partsale and partfinancing in a true sale the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet in a financing the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator under us accounting standards the originator achieves a sale by being at arms length from the issuer in which case the issuer is classified as a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe because of these structural issues the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank the arranger in setting up the structure of the transaction issuanceedit to be able to buy the assets from the originator the issuer spv issues tradable securities to fund the purchase investors purchase the securities either through a private offering targeting institutional investors or on the open market the performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision in transactions with static assets a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors the depositor has taken on added significance under regulation ab the depositor typically owns  of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction in transactions with managed traded assets asset managers assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors some deals may include a thirdparty guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets the principal and the interest payments for a fee the securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system fixed rate abs set the “coupon” rate at the time of issuance in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and tbills floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and nonamortizing assets in the floating market in contrast to fixed rate securities the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a us treasury rate or more typically the london interbank offered rate libor the floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk credit enhancement and tranchingedit unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured securities created in a securitization are credit enhanced meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originators unsecured debt or underlying asset pool this increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties such as surety bonds and parental guarantees although this may introduce a conflict of interest the issued securities are often split into tranches or categorized into varying degrees of subordination each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure there is generally a senior a class of securities and one or more junior subordinated b c etc classes that function as protective layers for the a class the senior classes have first claim on the cash that the spv receives and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid because of the cascading effect between classes this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall if the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities eg when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches and the upperlevel tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches the senior securities might be aaa or aa rated signifying a lower risk while the lowercredit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating signifying a higher risk the most junior class often called the equity class is the most exposed to payment risk in some cases this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow in some cases the equity class receives no coupon either fixed or floating but only the residual cash flow if any after all the other classes have been paid there may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets this is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which in essence are repaid whenever the properties are sold since any early repayments are passed on to this class it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow if the underlying assets are mortgages or loans there are usually two separate waterfalls because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched but if the assets are incomebased transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment in this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive in addition to subordination credit may be enhanced through a reserve or spread account in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments chargeoffs and other fees have been paidoff are accumulated and can be used when spe expenses are greater than its income thirdparty insurance or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities overcollateralisation usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected cash funding or a cash collateral account generally consisting of shortterm highly rated investments purchased either from the sellers own funds or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows a thirdparty letter of credit or corporate guarantee a backup servicer for the loans discounted receivables for the pool servicingedit a servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal the servicer can often be the originator because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the special purpose vehicle the servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy which influences the proceeds collected the chargeoffs and the recoveries on the loans any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account and any further excess is returned to the seller bond rating agencies publish ratings of assetbacked securities based on the performance of the collateral pool the credit enhancements and the probability of default when the issuer is structured as a trust the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gatekeeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer even though the trustee is part of the spv which is typically wholly owned by the originator the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets typically the investors repayment structuresedit unlike corporate bonds most securitizations are amortized meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets such as home equity loans auto loans and student loans prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing abs the possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity the psa prepayment model is a wellknown example a controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising after a predetermined revolving period during which only interest payments are made these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments usually within a year an early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early on the other hand bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment the most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date however the majority of these securitizations are paid on time the second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity this means that the first tranche which may have a oneyear average life will receive all principal payments until it is retired then the second tranche begins to receive principal and so forth pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security structural risks and misincentivesedit some originators eg of mortgages have prioritised loan volume over credit quality disregarding the longterm risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization other originators aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation have paid more attention to credit qualitycitation needed special types of securitizationedit master trustedit a master trust is a type of spv particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times in a typical master trust transaction an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables after this transaction typically the originator would continue to service the receivables in this case the credit cards there are various risks involved with master trusts specifically one risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables for example credit cardbacked securities can have maturities of up to  years but credit cardbacked receivables usually pay off much more quickly to solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period an accumulation period and an amortization period all three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables during the revolving period principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables during the accumulation period these payments are accumulated in a separate account during the amortization period new payments are passed through to the investors a second risk is that the total investor interests and the sellers interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards but the seller originator owns the accounts this can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts typically to solve this there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables a third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and undercollateralize total investor interest to prevent this often there is a required minimum sellers interest and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur issuance trustedit in  citibank introduced a new structure for credit cardbacked securities called an issuance trust which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche there are other benefits to an issuance trust they provide more flexibility in issuing seniorsubordinate securities can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investmentgrade securities issued by them and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities because of these issues issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit cardbacked securities grantor trustedit grantor trusts are typically used in automobilebacked securities and remics real estate mortgage investment conduits grantor trusts are very similar to passthrough trusts used in the earlier days of securitization an originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust which issues classes of securities backed by these loans principal and interest received on the loans after expenses are taken into account are passed through to the holders of the securities on a prorata basis owner trustedit in an owner trust there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities in an owner trust both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities due to this owner trusts can tailor maturity risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs usually any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that all income is returned to the seller owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by overcollateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal which leaves more collateral for the other classes motives for securitizationedit advantages to issueredit reduces funding costs through securitization a company rated bb but with aaa worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly aaa rates this is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs the difference between bb debt and aaa debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points for example moodys downgraded ford motor credits rating in january  but senior automobile backed securities issued by ford motor credit in january  and april  continue to be rated aaa because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements reduces assetliability mismatch depending on the structure chosen securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis essentially in most banks and finance companies the liability book or the funding is from borrowings this often comes at a high cost securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a selffunded asset book lower capital requirements some firms due to legal regulatory or other reasons have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be by securitizing some of their assets which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the earning power of the assets locking in profits for a given block of business the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain once the block has been securitized the level of profits has now been locked in for that company thus the risk of profit not emerging or the benefit of superprofits has now been passed on transfer risks credit liquidity prepayment reinvestment asset concentration securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it to one that does two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and entertainment securitizations similarly by securitizing a block of business thereby locking in a degree of profits the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business off balance sheet derivative finance of many types have in the past been referred to as offbalancesheet this term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact while there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet there is also a generally accepted principle that where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gainloss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities certain credit derivatives products particularly credit default swaps now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation in the case of credit default swaps this documentation has been formulated by the international swaps and derivatives association isda who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets earnings securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm when a securitization takes place there often is a true sale that takes place between the originator the parent company and the spe this sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the true sale to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent companys balance sheet which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale while not illegal in any respect this does distort the true earnings of the parent company admissibility future cashflows may not get full credit in a companys accounts life insurance companies for example may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset liquidity future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending whereas once the book has been securitized the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment this also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates disadvantages to issueredit may reduce portfolio quality if the aaa risks for example are being securitized out this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk costs securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs legal fees underwriting fees rating fees and ongoing administration an allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations especially if it is an atypical securitization size limitations securitizations often require large scale structuring and thus may not be costefficient for small and medium transactions risks since securitization is a structured transaction it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment such as prepayment as well as credit loss especially for structures where there are some retained strips advantages to investorsedit opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return on a riskadjusted basis opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets due to the stringent requirements for corporations for example to attain high ratings there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist securitizations however allow for the creation of large quantities of aaa aa or a rated bonds and risk averse institutional investors or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets have access to a larger pool of investment options portfolio diversification depending on the securitization hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities isolation of credit risk from the parent entity since the assets that are securitized are isolated at least in theory from the assets of the originating entity under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the parent because the underlying risks are different for example a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest or just as likely the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors and hence less profitable risks to investorsedit liquidity risk creditdefault default risk is generally accepted as a borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time for abs default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus a key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating different tranches within the abs are rated differently with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings almost all mortgages including reverse mortgages and student loans are now insured by the government meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively overinflated in other words there are no limits or curbs on overspending or the liabilities to taxpayers however the credit crisis of – has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization which doesnt encourage improvement of underwriting standards event risk prepaymentreinvestmentearly amortization the majority of revolving abs are subject to some degree of early amortization risk the risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely typically payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers insufficient excess spread a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer currency interest rate fluctuations like all fixed income securities the prices of fixed rate abs move in response to changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate abs prices less than fixed rate securities as the index against which the abs rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy furthermore interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of abs which can affect yields home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates while auto loans student loans and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates contractual agreements moral hazard investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations’ underlying assets if the manager earns fees based on performance there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deals excess spread servicer risk the transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent this risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction historyedit early developmentsedit see also economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic modern practice of securitization has its roots in the thcentury dutch republic examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the th century among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  in february  the us department of housing and urban development created the first modern residential mortgagebacked security the government national mortgage association gnma or ginnie mae sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans to facilitate the securitization of nonmortgage assets businesses substituted private credit enhancements first they overcollateralised pools of assets shortly thereafter they improved thirdparty and structural enhancements in  securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of nonmortgage assets — automobile loans a pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume auto loans were a good match for structured finance their maturities considerably shorter than those of mortgages made the timing of cash flows more predictable and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence this early auto loan deal was a  million securitization originated by marine midland bank and securitised in  by the certificate for automobile receivables trust cars  the first significant bank credit card sale came to market in  with a private placement of  million of outstanding bank card loans this transaction demonstrated to investors that if the yields were high enough loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes easing balance sheet and capital constraints while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees after the success of this initial transaction investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows starting in the s with some earlier private transactions securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe this activity grew to nearly bn of issuance in  following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by hurricane katrina and regulation xxx key areas of activity in the broad area of alternative risk transfer include catastrophe bonds life insurance securitization and reinsurance sidecars the first public securitization of community reinvestment act cra loans started in  cra loans are loans targeted to low and moderate income borrowers and neighborhoods as estimated by the bond market association in the united states the total amount outstandingclarification needed at the end of  was  trillion this amount was about  percent of total outstanding bond market debt  trillion about  percent of mortgagerelated debt  trillion and about  percent of corporate debt  trillion in the united states in nominal terms over the previous ten years – absclarification needed amount outstanding had grown about  percent annually with mortgagerelated debt and corporate debt each growing at about  percent gross public issuance of assetbacked securities was strong setting new records in many years in  issuance was at an alltime record of about  trillion at the end of  the larger sectors of this market were credit cardbacked securities  percent homeequity backed securities  percent automobilebacked securities  percent and collateralized debt obligations  percent among the other market segments were student loanbacked securities  percent equipment leases  percent manufactured housing  percent small business loans such as loans to convenience stores and gas stations and aircraft leases modern securitization took off in the late s or early s thanks to the innovative structures implemented across the asset classes such as uk mortgage master trusts concept imported from the us credit cards insurancebacked transaction such as those implemented by the insurance securitization guru emmanuel issanchou or even more esoteric asset classes for example securitization of lottery receivables as the result of the credit crunch precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis the us market for bonds backed by securitised loans was very weak in  except for bonds guaranteed by a federally backed agency as a result interest rates rose for loans that were previously securitised such as home mortgages student loans auto loans and commercial mortgages recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects for example solarcity offered the first us assetbacked security in the solar industry in  recent lawsuitsedit recently there have been several lawsuits attributable to the rating of securitizations by the three leading rating agencies in july  the usa’s largest public pension fund has filed suit in california state court in connection with  billion in losses that it says were caused by “wildly inaccurate” credit ratings from the three leading ratings agencies see alsoedit collateralized debt obligation securitization vehicle for corporate debt securities

encyclopedia jump to navigation search for securitization in international relations see securitization international relations securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages commercial mortgages auto loans or credit card debt obligations or other nondebt assets which generate receivables and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities which may be described as bonds passthrough securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgagebacked securities mbs while those backed by other types of receivables are assetbacked securities abs critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risk and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition offbalance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide the extent of leverage of the securitizing firm thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an underpricing of credit risk offbalance sheet securitizations also played a large role in the high leverage level of us financial institutions before the financial crisis and the need for bailouts the granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers unlike general corporate debt the credit quality of securitized debt is nonstationary due to changes in volatility that are time and structuredependent if the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves if improperly structured the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late th century to an estimated outstanding of  trillion in the united states and  trillion in europe as of the nd quarter of  in  abs issuance amounted to  trillion in the us and  billion in europe wbs whole business securitization arrangements first appeared in the united kingdom in the s and became common in various commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent

motives for securitization  advantages to issuer  disadvantages to issuer  advantages to investors  risks to investors  history  early developments  recent lawsuits  see also  references  external links structureedit pooling and transferedit the originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal this is typically a company looking to either raise capital restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt consumer or otherwise for the purpose of subsequent securitization under traditional corporate finance concepts such a company would have three options to raise new capital a loan bond issue or issuance of stock however stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates the consistently revenuegenerating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole for instance a leasing company may have provided m nominal value of leases and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these it cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required if it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today in effect receiving today the present value of a future cash flow where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets a suitably large portfolio of assets is pooled and transferred to a special purpose vehicle or spv the issuer a taxexempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets once the assets are transferred to the issuer there is normally no recourse to the originator the issuer is bankruptcy remote meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator in order to achieve this the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities many issuers are typically orphaned in the case of certain assets such as credit card debt where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables a trust in favor of the spv may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment see the outline of the master trust structure below accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale a financing a partial sale or a partsale and partfinancing in a true sale the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet in a financing the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator under us accounting standards the originator achieves a sale by being at arms length from the issuer in which case the issuer is classified as a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe because of these structural issues the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank the arranger in setting up the structure of the transaction issuanceedit to be able to buy the assets from the originator the issuer spv issues tradable securities to fund the purchase investors purchase the securities either through a private offering targeting institutional investors or on the open market the performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision in transactions with static assets a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors the depositor has taken on added significance under regulation ab the depositor typically owns  of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction in transactions with managed traded assets asset managers assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors some deals may include a thirdparty guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets the principal and the interest payments for a fee the securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system fixed rate abs set the “coupon” rate at the time of issuance in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and tbills floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and nonamortizing assets in the floating market in contrast to fixed rate securities the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a us treasury rate or more typically the london interbank offered rate libor the floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk credit enhancement and tranchingedit unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured securities created in a securitization are credit enhanced meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originators unsecured debt or underlying asset pool this increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties such as surety bonds and parental guarantees although this may introduce a conflict of interest the issued securities are often split into tranches or categorized into varying degrees of subordination each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure there is generally a senior a class of securities and one or more junior subordinated b c etc classes that function as protective layers for the a class the senior classes have first claim on the cash that the spv receives and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid because of the cascading effect between classes this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall if the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities eg when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches and the upperlevel tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches the senior securities might be aaa or aa rated signifying a lower risk while the lowercredit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating signifying a higher risk the most junior class often called the equity class is the most exposed to payment risk in some cases this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow in some cases the equity class receives no coupon either fixed or floating but only the residual cash flow if any after all the other classes have been paid there may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets this is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which in essence are repaid whenever the properties are sold since any early repayments are passed on to this class it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow if the underlying assets are mortgages or loans there are usually two separate waterfalls because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched but if the assets are incomebased transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment in this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive in addition to subordination credit may be enhanced through a reserve or spread account in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments chargeoffs and other fees have been paidoff are accumulated and can be used when spe expenses are greater than its income thirdparty insurance or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities overcollateralisation usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected cash funding or a cash collateral account generally consisting of shortterm highly rated investments purchased either from the sellers own funds or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows a thirdparty letter of credit or corporate guarantee a backup servicer for the loans discounted receivables for the pool servicingedit a servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal the servicer can often be the originator because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the special purpose vehicle the servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy which influences the proceeds collected the chargeoffs and the recoveries on the loans any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account and any further excess is returned to the seller bond rating agencies publish ratings of assetbacked securities based on the performance of the collateral pool the credit enhancements and the probability of default when the issuer is structured as a trust the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gatekeeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer even though the trustee is part of the spv which is typically wholly owned by the originator the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets typically the investors repayment structuresedit unlike corporate bonds most securitizations are amortized meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets such as home equity loans auto loans and student loans prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing abs the possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity the psa prepayment model is a wellknown example a controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising after a predetermined revolving period during which only interest payments are made these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments usually within a year an early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early on the other hand bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment the most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date however the majority of these securitizations are paid on time the second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity this means that the first tranche which may have a oneyear average life will receive all principal payments until it is retired then the second tranche begins to receive principal and so forth pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security structural risks and misincentivesedit some originators eg of mortgages have prioritised loan volume over credit quality disregarding the longterm risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization other originators aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation have paid more attention to credit qualitycitation needed special types of securitizationedit master trustedit a master trust is a type of spv particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times in a typical master trust transaction an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables after this transaction typically the originator would continue to service the receivables in this case the credit cards there are various risks involved with master trusts specifically one risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables for example credit cardbacked securities can have maturities of up to  years but credit cardbacked receivables usually pay off much more quickly to solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period an accumulation period and an amortization period all three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables during the revolving period principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables during the accumulation period these payments are accumulated in a separate account during the amortization period new payments are passed through to the investors a second risk is that the total investor interests and the sellers interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards but the seller originator owns the accounts this can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts typically to solve this there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables a third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and undercollateralize total investor interest to prevent this often there is a required minimum sellers interest and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur issuance trustedit in  citibank introduced a new structure for credit cardbacked securities called an issuance trust which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche there are other benefits to an issuance trust they provide more flexibility in issuing seniorsubordinate securities can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investmentgrade securities issued by them and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities because of these issues issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit cardbacked securities grantor trustedit grantor trusts are typically used in automobilebacked securities and remics real estate mortgage investment conduits grantor trusts are very similar to passthrough trusts used in the earlier days of securitization an originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust which issues classes of securities backed by these loans principal and interest received on the loans after expenses are taken into account are passed through to the holders of the securities on a prorata basis owner trustedit in an owner trust there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities in an owner trust both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities due to this owner trusts can tailor maturity risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs usually any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that all income is returned to the seller owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by overcollateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal which leaves more collateral for the other classes motives for securitizationedit advantages to issueredit reduces funding costs through securitization a company rated bb but with aaa worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly aaa rates this is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs the difference between bb debt and aaa debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points for example moodys downgraded ford motor credits rating in january  but senior automobile backed securities issued by ford motor credit in january  and april  continue to be rated aaa because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements reduces assetliability mismatch depending on the structure chosen securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis essentially in most banks and finance companies the liability book or the funding is from borrowings this often comes at a high cost securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a selffunded asset book lower capital requirements some firms due to legal regulatory or other reasons have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be by securitizing some of their assets which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the earning power of the assets locking in profits for a given block of business the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain once the block has been securitized the level of profits has now been locked in for that company thus the risk of profit not emerging or the benefit of superprofits has now been passed on transfer risks credit liquidity prepayment reinvestment asset concentration securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it to one that does two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and entertainment securitizations similarly by securitizing a block of business thereby locking in a degree of profits the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business off balance sheet derivative finance of many types have in the past been referred to as offbalancesheet this term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact while there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet there is also a generally accepted principle that where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gainloss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities certain credit derivatives products particularly credit default swaps now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation in the case of credit default swaps this documentation has been formulated by the international swaps and derivatives association isda who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets earnings securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm when a securitization takes place there often is a true sale that takes place between the originator the parent company and the spe this sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the true sale to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent companys balance sheet which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale while not illegal in any respect this does distort the true earnings of the parent company admissibility future cashflows may not get full credit in a companys accounts life insurance companies for example may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset liquidity future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending whereas once the book has been securitized the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment this also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates disadvantages to issueredit may reduce portfolio quality if the aaa risks for example are being securitized out this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk costs securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs legal fees underwriting fees rating fees and ongoing administration an allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations especially if it is an atypical securitization size limitations securitizations often require large scale structuring and thus may not be costefficient for small and medium transactions risks since securitization is a structured transaction it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment such as prepayment as well as credit loss especially for structures where there are some retained strips advantages to investorsedit opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return on a riskadjusted basis opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets due to the stringent requirements for corporations for example to attain high ratings there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist securitizations however allow for the creation of large quantities of aaa aa or a rated bonds and risk averse institutional investors or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets have access to a larger pool of investment options portfolio diversification depending on the securitization hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities isolation of credit risk from the parent entity since the assets that are securitized are isolated at least in theory from the assets of the originating entity under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the parent because the underlying risks are different for example a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest or just as likely the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors and hence less profitable risks to investorsedit liquidity risk creditdefault default risk is generally accepted as a borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time for abs default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus a key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating different tranches within the abs are rated differently with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings almost all mortgages including reverse mortgages and student loans are now insured by the government meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively overinflated in other words there are no limits or curbs on overspending or the liabilities to taxpayers however the credit crisis of – has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization which doesnt encourage improvement of underwriting standards event risk prepaymentreinvestmentearly amortization the majority of revolving abs are subject to some degree of early amortization risk the risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely typically payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers insufficient excess spread a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer currency interest rate fluctuations like all fixed income securities the prices of fixed rate abs move in response to changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate abs prices less than fixed rate securities as the index against which the abs rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy furthermore interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of abs which can affect yields home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates while auto loans student loans and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates contractual agreements moral hazard investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations’ underlying assets if the manager earns fees based on performance there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deals excess spread servicer risk the transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent this risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction historyedit early developmentsedit see also economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic modern practice of securitization has its roots in the thcentury dutch republic examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the th century among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  in february  the us department of housing and urban development created the first modern residential mortgagebacked security the government national mortgage association gnma or ginnie mae sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans to facilitate the securitization of nonmortgage assets businesses substituted private credit enhancements first they overcollateralised pools of assets shortly thereafter they improved thirdparty and structural enhancements in  securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of nonmortgage assets — automobile loans a pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume auto loans were a good match for structured finance their maturities considerably shorter than those of mortgages made the timing of cash flows more predictable and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence this early auto loan deal was a  million securitization originated by marine midland bank and securitised in  by the certificate for automobile receivables trust cars  the first significant bank credit card sale came to market in  with a private placement of  million of outstanding bank card loans this transaction demonstrated to investors that if the yields were high enough loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes easing balance sheet and capital constraints while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees after the success of this initial transaction investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows starting in the s with some earlier private transactions securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe this activity grew to nearly bn of issuance in  following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by hurricane katrina and regulation xxx key areas of activity in the broad area of alternative risk transfer include catastrophe bonds life insurance securitization and reinsurance sidecars the first public securitization of community reinvestment act cra loans started in  cra loans are loans targeted to low and moderate income borrowers and neighborhoods as estimated by the bond market association in the united states the total amount outstandingclarification needed at the end of  was  trillion this amount was about  percent of total outstanding bond market debt  trillion about  percent of mortgagerelated debt  trillion and about  percent of corporate debt  trillion in the united states in nominal terms over the previous ten years – absclarification needed amount outstanding had grown about  percent annually with mortgagerelated debt and corporate debt each growing at about  percent gross public issuance of assetbacked securities was strong setting new records in many years in  issuance was at an alltime record of about  trillion at the end of  the larger sectors of this market were credit cardbacked securities  percent homeequity backed securities  percent automobilebacked securities  percent and collateralized debt obligations  percent among the other market segments were student loanbacked securities  percent equipment leases  percent manufactured housing  percent small business loans such as loans to convenience stores and gas stations and aircraft leases modern securitization took off in the late s or early s thanks to the innovative structures implemented across the asset classes such as uk mortgage master trusts concept imported from the us credit cards insurancebacked transaction such as those implemented by the insurance securitization guru emmanuel issanchou or even more esoteric asset classes for example securitization of lottery receivables as the result of the credit crunch precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis the us market for bonds backed by securitised loans was very weak in  except for bonds guaranteed by a federally backed agency as a result interest rates rose for loans that were previously securitised such as home mortgages student loans auto loans and commercial mortgages recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects for example solarcity offered the first us assetbacked security in the solar industry in  recent lawsuitsedit recently there have been several lawsuits attributable to the rating of securitizations by the three leading rating agencies in july  the usa’s largest public pension fund has filed suit in california state court in connection with  billion in losses that it says were caused by “wildly inaccurate” credit ratings from the three leading ratings agencies see alsoedit collateralized debt obligation securitization vehicle for corporate debt securities

encyclopedia jump to navigation search for securitization in international relations see securitization international relations securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages commercial mortgages auto loans or credit card debt obligations or other nondebt assets which generate receivables and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities which may be described as bonds passthrough securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgagebacked securities mbs while those backed by other types of receivables are assetbacked securities abs critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risk and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition offbalance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide the extent of leverage of the securitizing firm thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an underpricing of credit risk offbalance sheet securitizations also played a large role in the high leverage level of us financial institutions before the financial crisis and the need for bailouts the granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers unlike general corporate debt the credit quality of securitized debt is nonstationary due to changes in volatility that are time and structuredependent if the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves if improperly structured the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late th century to an estimated outstanding of  trillion in the united states and  trillion in europe as of the nd quarter of  in  abs issuance amounted to  trillion in the us and  billion in europe wbs whole business securitization arrangements first appeared in the united kingdom in the s and became common in various commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent

motives for securitization  advantages to issuer  disadvantages to issuer  advantages to investors  risks to investors  history  early developments  recent lawsuits  see also  references  external links structureedit pooling and transferedit the originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal this is typically a company looking to either raise capital restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt consumer or otherwise for the purpose of subsequent securitization under traditional corporate finance concepts such a company would have three options to raise new capital a loan bond issue or issuance of stock however stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates the consistently revenuegenerating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole for instance a leasing company may have provided m nominal value of leases and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these it cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required if it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today in effect receiving today the present value of a future cash flow where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets a suitably large portfolio of assets is pooled and transferred to a special purpose vehicle or spv the issuer a taxexempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets once the assets are transferred to the issuer there is normally no recourse to the originator the issuer is bankruptcy remote meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator in order to achieve this the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities many issuers are typically orphaned in the case of certain assets such as credit card debt where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables a trust in favor of the spv may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment see the outline of the master trust structure below accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale a financing a partial sale or a partsale and partfinancing in a true sale the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet in a financing the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator under us accounting standards the originator achieves a sale by being at arms length from the issuer in which case the issuer is classified as a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe because of these structural issues the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank the arranger in setting up the structure of the transaction issuanceedit to be able to buy the assets from the originator the issuer spv issues tradable securities to fund the purchase investors purchase the securities either through a private offering targeting institutional investors or on the open market the performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision in transactions with static assets a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors the depositor has taken on added significance under regulation ab the depositor typically owns  of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction in transactions with managed traded assets asset managers assemble the underlying collateral help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors some deals may include a thirdparty guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets the principal and the interest payments for a fee the securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system fixed rate abs set the “coupon” rate at the time of issuance in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and tbills floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and nonamortizing assets in the floating market in contrast to fixed rate securities the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a us treasury rate or more typically the london interbank offered rate libor the floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk credit enhancement and tranchingedit unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured securities created in a securitization are credit enhanced meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originators unsecured debt or underlying asset pool this increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties such as surety bonds and parental guarantees although this may introduce a conflict of interest the issued securities are often split into tranches or categorized into varying degrees of subordination each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure there is generally a senior a class of securities and one or more junior subordinated b c etc classes that function as protective layers for the a class the senior classes have first claim on the cash that the spv receives and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid because of the cascading effect between classes this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall if the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities eg when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches and the upperlevel tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches the senior securities might be aaa or aa rated signifying a lower risk while the lowercredit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating signifying a higher risk the most junior class often called the equity class is the most exposed to payment risk in some cases this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow in some cases the equity class receives no coupon either fixed or floating but only the residual cash flow if any after all the other classes have been paid there may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets this is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which in essence are repaid whenever the properties are sold since any early repayments are passed on to this class it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow if the underlying assets are mortgages or loans there are usually two separate waterfalls because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched but if the assets are incomebased transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment in this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive in addition to subordination credit may be enhanced through a reserve or spread account in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments chargeoffs and other fees have been paidoff are accumulated and can be used when spe expenses are greater than its income thirdparty insurance or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities overcollateralisation usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected cash funding or a cash collateral account generally consisting of shortterm highly rated investments purchased either from the sellers own funds or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows a thirdparty letter of credit or corporate guarantee a backup servicer for the loans discounted receivables for the pool servicingedit a servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal the servicer can often be the originator because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the special purpose vehicle the servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy which influences the proceeds collected the chargeoffs and the recoveries on the loans any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account and any further excess is returned to the seller bond rating agencies publish ratings of assetbacked securities based on the performance of the collateral pool the credit enhancements and the probability of default when the issuer is structured as a trust the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gatekeeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer even though the trustee is part of the spv which is typically wholly owned by the originator the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets typically the investors repayment structuresedit unlike corporate bonds most securitizations are amortized meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets such as home equity loans auto loans and student loans prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing abs the possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity the psa prepayment model is a wellknown example a controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising after a predetermined revolving period during which only interest payments are made these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments usually within a year an early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early on the other hand bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment the most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date however the majority of these securitizations are paid on time the second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity this means that the first tranche which may have a oneyear average life will receive all principal payments until it is retired then the second tranche begins to receive principal and so forth pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security structural risks and misincentivesedit some originators eg of mortgages have prioritised loan volume over credit quality disregarding the longterm risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization other originators aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation have paid more attention to credit qualitycitation needed special types of securitizationedit master trustedit a master trust is a type of spv particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times in a typical master trust transaction an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables after this transaction typically the originator would continue to service the receivables in this case the credit cards there are various risks involved with master trusts specifically one risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables for example credit cardbacked securities can have maturities of up to  years but credit cardbacked receivables usually pay off much more quickly to solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period an accumulation period and an amortization period all three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables during the revolving period principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables during the accumulation period these payments are accumulated in a separate account during the amortization period new payments are passed through to the investors a second risk is that the total investor interests and the sellers interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards but the seller originator owns the accounts this can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts typically to solve this there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables a third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and undercollateralize total investor interest to prevent this often there is a required minimum sellers interest and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur issuance trustedit in  citibank introduced a new structure for credit cardbacked securities called an issuance trust which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche there are other benefits to an issuance trust they provide more flexibility in issuing seniorsubordinate securities can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investmentgrade securities issued by them and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities because of these issues issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit cardbacked securities grantor trustedit grantor trusts are typically used in automobilebacked securities and remics real estate mortgage investment conduits grantor trusts are very similar to passthrough trusts used in the earlier days of securitization an originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust which issues classes of securities backed by these loans principal and interest received on the loans after expenses are taken into account are passed through to the holders of the securities on a prorata basis owner trustedit in an owner trust there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities in an owner trust both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities due to this owner trusts can tailor maturity risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs usually any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that all income is returned to the seller owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by overcollateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal which leaves more collateral for the other classes motives for securitizationedit advantages to issueredit reduces funding costs through securitization a company rated bb but with aaa worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly aaa rates this is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs the difference between bb debt and aaa debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points for example moodys downgraded ford motor credits rating in january  but senior automobile backed securities issued by ford motor credit in january  and april  continue to be rated aaa because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements reduces assetliability mismatch depending on the structure chosen securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis essentially in most banks and finance companies the liability book or the funding is from borrowings this often comes at a high cost securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a selffunded asset book lower capital requirements some firms due to legal regulatory or other reasons have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be by securitizing some of their assets which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the earning power of the assets locking in profits for a given block of business the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain once the block has been securitized the level of profits has now been locked in for that company thus the risk of profit not emerging or the benefit of superprofits has now been passed on transfer risks credit liquidity prepayment reinvestment asset concentration securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it to one that does two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and entertainment securitizations similarly by securitizing a block of business thereby locking in a degree of profits the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business off balance sheet derivative finance of many types have in the past been referred to as offbalancesheet this term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact while there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet there is also a generally accepted principle that where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gainloss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities certain credit derivatives products particularly credit default swaps now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation in the case of credit default swaps this documentation has been formulated by the international swaps and derivatives association isda who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets earnings securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm when a securitization takes place there often is a true sale that takes place between the originator the parent company and the spe this sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the true sale to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent companys balance sheet which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale while not illegal in any respect this does distort the true earnings of the parent company admissibility future cashflows may not get full credit in a companys accounts life insurance companies for example may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset liquidity future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending whereas once the book has been securitized the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment this also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates disadvantages to issueredit may reduce portfolio quality if the aaa risks for example are being securitized out this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk costs securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs legal fees underwriting fees rating fees and ongoing administration an allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations especially if it is an atypical securitization size limitations securitizations often require large scale structuring and thus may not be costefficient for small and medium transactions risks since securitization is a structured transaction it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment such as prepayment as well as credit loss especially for structures where there are some retained strips advantages to investorsedit opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return on a riskadjusted basis opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets due to the stringent requirements for corporations for example to attain high ratings there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist securitizations however allow for the creation of large quantities of aaa aa or a rated bonds and risk averse institutional investors or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets have access to a larger pool of investment options portfolio diversification depending on the securitization hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities isolation of credit risk from the parent entity since the assets that are securitized are isolated at least in theory from the assets of the originating entity under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the parent because the underlying risks are different for example a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest or just as likely the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors and hence less profitable risks to investorsedit liquidity risk creditdefault default risk is generally accepted as a borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time for abs default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus a key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating different tranches within the abs are rated differently with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings almost all mortgages including reverse mortgages and student loans are now insured by the government meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively overinflated in other words there are no limits or curbs on overspending or the liabilities to taxpayers however the credit crisis of – has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization which doesnt encourage improvement of underwriting standards event risk prepaymentreinvestmentearly amortization the majority of revolving abs are subject to some degree of early amortization risk the risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely typically payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers insufficient excess spread a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer currency interest rate fluctuations like all fixed income securities the prices of fixed rate abs move in response to changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate abs prices less than fixed rate securities as the index against which the abs rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy furthermore interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of abs which can affect yields home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates while auto loans student loans and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates contractual agreements moral hazard investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations’ underlying assets if the manager earns fees based on performance there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deals excess spread servicer risk the transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent this risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction historyedit early developmentsedit see also economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic modern practice of securitization has its roots in the thcentury dutch republic examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the th century among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  in february  the us department of housing and urban development created the first modern residential mortgagebacked security the government national mortgage association gnma or ginnie mae sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans to facilitate the securitization of nonmortgage assets businesses substituted private credit enhancements first they overcollateralised pools of assets shortly thereafter they improved thirdparty and structural enhancements in  securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of nonmortgage assets — automobile loans a pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume auto loans were a good match for structured finance their maturities considerably shorter than those of mortgages made the timing of cash flows more predictable and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence this early auto loan deal was a  million securitization originated by marine midland bank and securitised in  by the certificate for automobile receivables trust cars  the first significant bank credit card sale came to market in  with a private placement of  million of outstanding bank card loans this transaction demonstrated to investors that if the yields were high enough loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes easing balance sheet and capital constraints while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees after the success of this initial transaction investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows starting in the s with some earlier private transactions securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe this activity grew to nearly bn of issuance in  following the

represent a complicated sector of the fixedincome market these products are pools of financial assets these are brought together to make a new security which is then divided and sold to investors because the value and cash flows of the new asset are based on its underlying securities these investments can be hard to analyze regardless of whether an individual ultimately chooses to invest in securitized products a better understanding of this dynamic market is instrumental to the development of a robust wellrounded investment education this article will explain what securitization is outline its benefits and discuss the investment characteristics of securitized products before concluding with a look at how securitized products might fit into an individual investors portfolio tutorial understanding the credit crisis how securitization workssecuritization describes the process of pooling financial assets and turning them into tradable securities the first products to be securitized were home mortgages these were followed by commercial mortgages credit card receivables auto loans student loans and many other financial assets bonds backed by home mortgages are commonly referred to as mortgagebacked securities mbs and bonds backed by nonmortgagerelated financial assets are called assetbacked securities abs although there are important distinctions among the various types of mortgage and assetbacked products for the purposes of this article we will simply refer to all of these bonds as securitized products they are also grouped into an area known as structured finance in the investment banking community to learn more check out profit from mortgage debt with mbs the process of creating a securitized bond is straightforward a financial institution the issuer with assets it wishes to securitize sells the assets to a specialpurpose vehicle spv for legal purposes the spv is a separate entity from the financial institution but the spv exists only to purchase the financial institutions assets by selling the assets to the spv the issuer receives cash and removes the assets from its balance sheet providing the issuer with greater financial flexibility the spv issues bonds to finance the purchase of the assets these bonds can be traded in the marketplace and are referred to as securitized products read about another use of spvs in investing in emerging market debt one key feature of securitized products is that they are usually issued in tranches this means that the larger deal is broken down into smaller pieces each of which has different investment characteristics the existence of different tranches makes securitized products appealing to a wide range of investors because each investor can choose the tranche that best combines his or her desire for yield cash flow and safety to learn more check out what is a tranche and behind the scenes of your mortgage benefits of securitizationthere are several key benefits that securitization provides to market participants and the broader economy frees capital for lending  securitization provides financial institutions with a mechanism for removing assets from their balance sheets thereby increasing the pool of available capital that can be loaned out lowers the cost of capital  a corollary to the increased abundance of capital is that the rate required on loans is lower lower interest rates promote increased economic growth read about how the federal reserve controls interest rates and stimulates the economy in how much influence does the fed have and the federal reserves fight against recession makes nontradable assets tradable – this action increases liquidity in a variety of previously illiquid financial products spreads the ownership of risk  pooling and distributing financial assets provides greater ability to diversify risk and provides investors with more choice as to how much risk to hold in their portfolios for further reading check out how do banks determine risk provides profits for financial intermediaries  intermediaries benefit by keeping the profits from the spread or difference between the interest rate on the underlying assets and the rate paid on the securities that are issued creates an attractive asset class for investors  purchasers of securitized products benefit from the fact that securitized products are often highly customizable and can offer a wide range of yields learn more in understanding structured products investment characteristics of securitized products high yieldmany securitized products offer relatively attractive yields these high returns dont come for free though compared to many other types of bonds the timing of the cash flows from securitized products is relatively uncertain this uncertainty is why investors demand higher returns diversificationas one of the largest fixedincome security types securitized products present fixedincome investors with an alternative to government corporate or municipal bonds to learn more check out the importance of diversification safetythere are several methods that financial intermediaries use in order to issue bonds that are safer than the assets that back them most securitized products have investmentgrade ratings learn more about bond ratings in what does investment grade mean and junk bonds everything you need to know internal credit enhancement refers to safeguards that are built into the structure of the securitized product itself common forms of internal credit enhancement include subordination where highly rated tranches receive cash flow priority over lowerrated tranches and overcollateralization where the amount of bonds issued by the spv is less than the value of the assets backing the deal the intended effect of any type of internal credit enhancement is that cash flow shortfalls due to losses in the value of the underlying assets do not affect the value of the safest tranches of bonds this works well given relatively low levels of losses but the value of the protection is less certain if losses on the underlying assets are substantial external credit enhancement occurs when a third party provides an additional guarantee of payment for bondholders common forms of external credit enhancement include thirdparty bond insurance letters of credit and corporate guarantees the main drawback to external credit enhancement is that the additional protection is only as good as the party providing it if the thirdparty guarantor experiences financial hardship the value of its guarantee may be negligible leaving the safety of the bonds dependent on the bonds underlying fundamentals securitized products and your portfolio as with many other areas of the fixedincome marketplace the main participants in the securitized products market are institutional investors there are several reasons for this including large average transaction sizes a lack of readily available pricing information and difficulty in properly valuing many securitized products learn the rules that govern bond pricing in bond market pricing conventions despite these challenges many individuals invest in securitized products owners of diversified fixedincome mutual funds or exchangetraded funds often indirectly hold securitized products through their funds holdings some individuals also choose to invest directly in securitized products most brokerage firms offer an inventory of securitized products to select from the best way to purchase securitized products from an inventory is to begin with an idea of the investment characteristics being sought size yield safety maturity etc by starting this way an investor is likely to find an appropriate securitized product that suits his or her needs and helps to build the investors portfolio to learn more check out the importance of asset allocation the bottom linebecause of the size and importance of the securitized products market a basic understanding of securitized products will benefit even investors who have no intention of investing directly in securitized products for individuals intrigued by this sector significant additional research should be conducted
