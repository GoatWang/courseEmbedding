edward g galante eon why he decided to attend northeastern“a number of utilities throughout new york and new england were concerned at that time that all the students entering electrical engineering were going to migrate into the computer sciences the hightech industries so they formed a power engineering program to try to attract kids into power generation and power distribution they had a competition on long island i wrote an essay and applied and got interviewed lo and behold i won the scholarship” listen to the full clip on his student experience at northeastern“i came here because it was a great education and because i knew coop was going to be a valuable experience but i probably wasn’t enamored with coming to a city school after your freshman year you didn’t live in a dorm you had to live off campus so there wasn’t a lot of natural coming together of people particularly for somebody who was from out of the area” listen to the full clip on his coop experience at exxonmobil“when i went to exxon as a coop they didn’t give you a diversity of experience as much as they gave you a lot of responsibility just as if i was a new engineer hired as i learned more they gave me more and more responsibility my last coop term i was running projects for them” listen to the full clip ed and cathie galante with president joseph e aoun on reconnecting with the university as an alumnus“my company exxon had a very very generous matching gift program a number of my cohorts at work were big supporters of their universities and used that program i was fortunately doing well in my career i said ‘i might as well do something because it’s like throwing money away if you don’t’” listen to the full clip on viewing the physical changes to campus upon his first visit as an alumnus“i can say it in three words gray to green back when i was here not only were the physical buildings gray it was a gray campus now there’s just a whole different feel when you walk on it it really went from being a gray kind of dismal grinditout kind of place to a more robust bright airy feeling” listen to the full clip on the evolution of northeastern’s students faculty and infrastructure “what i’ve seen is a remarkable transformation not only in the physical facilities but in the diversity of the student body the academic credentials of the student body the quality of the faculty you could just go on and on down the list in engineering terminology all the vectors are in the right direction” listen to the full clip ed galante with chairman of the board sy sternberg on his motivation for establishing the galante engineering and mba program“in my view from a business leadership perspective engineering is a great foundation what you want to be able to do is give people the technical skills that go on top of that to speak business language to understand the business process” listen to the full clip on the how northeastern responded to the necessity for change“you needed to change something fortunately i think they made a lot of the right choices in how they addressed that both in terms of quality of faculty quality of students quality of campus i don’t think we would be where we are today if you just improved one” listen to the full clip on the role he envisions for northeastern in the future“i think it will be more international both in terms of its presence here as well as its presence around the globe i think it will be consistent with the evolution of the times it will continue to be an urbanbased practicebased experiential learningbased institution i think the academic standards will continue to climb” listen to the full clip this interview is available in its entirety in the northeastern university archives photos carla osberg photography the office of alumni relations university libraries archives and special collections department biography edward g galante graduated from northeastern university in  receiving his bachelor of science degree in civil engineering he joined his coop employer exxonmobil upon the completion of his course work and remained with the company for  years he retired in  » read more
