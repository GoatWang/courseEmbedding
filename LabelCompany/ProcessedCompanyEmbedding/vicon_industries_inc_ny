results for the second quarter ended march   hauppauge ny   may    vicon industries inc nyse mkt vii a global producer of endtoend security solutions today announced its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended march   vicon’s ceo john badke said the company’s results for the quarter reflect an expected reduction in revenues driven primarily by decreased sales of our legacy product offerings however we were pleased to launch our new valerus video management system vms platform in the quarter which has received very positive feedback from the market significant enhancements to this platform as well as to the company’s camera line were featured at the security industry’s largest annual trade show in early april and will be available for release by the end of june  we believe that valerus is the next generation enterprise level vms platform that embodies the ease of use openness and flexibility the market will come to demand from their overly complicated legacy systems we have also ramped up our sales and marketing activities in anticipation of increasing market demand for our new solutions in april  the company entered into an amended credit agreement with its current lender which essentially freed up  million of availability under its  million credit line that was previously subject to a borrowing base formula extended the facility maturity date to april  and relaxed its minimum tangible net worth financial covenant the company expects to continue to draw on this facility to finance its near term working capital needs and is considering additional financing options second quarter fiscal  financial results revenues for the second quarter of fiscal  decreased  to  million as compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  the  million decrease in the current quarter included a  million or  decrease in sales in the americas market and a  or  decrease in emea market sales  revenues weakened across all market segments due principally to a continuing reliance on legacy product offerings and the continuing market effects of previously reported camera line issues order intake for the current quarter decreased  to  million as compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  gross profit margins were  for the second quarter of fiscal  as compared to  for the second quarter of fiscal  prior year quarter margins were negatively impacted by recognition of   of additional inventory provisions relating to the rework and transition of the companys iqinvision camera line to a new contract manufacturing partner operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal  decreased  million to  million compared with  million in the second quarter of fiscal  in the prior year quarter the company charged off its entire  million goodwill carrying value originating from the august  iqinvision business combination excluding the effects of the prior year quarter goodwill writeoff operating expenses decreased  in the current quarter due to ongoing selling general and administrative cost reduction initiatives net loss for the second quarter of fiscal  was  million or  per basic and diluted share as compared
