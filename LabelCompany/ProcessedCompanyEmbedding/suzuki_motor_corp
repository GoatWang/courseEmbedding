because it held that two of the rulings violated ksa a and  of the kansas product liability act kpla ksa  et seq griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   specifically the court of appeals held the district court should not have allowed into evidence suzukis successor vehicle to the sidekick the vitara as a reasonable alternative design to the sidekick it also held the district court should not have allowed into evidence certain engineering and testing standards to analyze the sidekick because they were not in use when the vehicle had been manufactured in  we granted griffins petition for review pursuant to ksa b the issues on appeal and our accompanying holdings are as follows  did the district court admit evidence in violation of ksa a because it allowed the j vehicle vitara as a reasonable alternative design to the j vehicle sidekick yes  did the district court admit evidence in violation of ksa a because it allowed testing and engineering standards not in use when the  sidekick was manufactured yes accordingly we affirm the court of appeals reverse the district court and remand for new trial facts because the facts of the accident and the procedural history of the case are not at issue in this appeal we adopt the following facts as set forth by the court of appeals wendy griffin was driving her sisters latasha and evelyn and her brother willie home in may  on us hwy  in geary county wendy was driving a  suzuki sidekick when she removed one hand from the steering wheel to adjust her skirt the car drifted onto the gravel shoulder on the right wendy steered hard left then hard right causing the vehicle to slide for a distance until it finally rolled over a number of times wendy latasha and willie were found outside the vehicle after the accident wendy later died latasha is now a paraplegic with diminished vision in her left eye from injuries she received in the accident willie eventually recovered from his injuries evelyn who used her seat belt was not ejected from the car and received minor injuries the  fourdoor sidekick was designed manufactured and sold by suzuki eartha and willie green wendy and latashas mother and stepfather purchased the vehicle used in october  the car was built in january  ultimately three cases were consolidated for trial latasha griffin by and through her parent eartha green against suzuki and american suzuki motors corporation asmc eartha green as heir at law of wendy griffin against suzuki and asmc and eartha green and national bank and trust company coadministrators for the estate of wendy griffin against suzuki and asmc the trials were bifurcated by dividing the liability and damage portions into separate proceedings griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   griffins theory of liability was that the  sidekick was unreasonably dangerous and defective in design and that the defendants negligently designed manufactured and tested the vehicle defendants responded that the sole cause of the accident was wendys negligent driving during discovery suzuki became convinced that griffin wanted to prove her theory of liability by using suzukis replacement for the sidekick the vitara j as a reasonable alternative design to the sidekick j accordingly suzuki filed a motion in limine to exclude all references to the j the district court denied suzukis motion as well as suzukis motion to reconsider suzuki made a third written effort which the court denied as a result evidence of the j as a reasonable alternative design to the j  sidekick was later admitted at trial suzuki filed two other motions in limine both of which concerned an april   report by general motors engineer ronald leffert the first motion sought to prohibit a griffin expert witness wade allen from testifying about any opinions formed by his reliance upon lefferts report the second motion sought to exclude general motors vehicle technical specifications for stability margin the heart of suzukis objections concerned lefferts formula for computing purported minimum rollover safety margins for shortwheelbased vehicles such as the j and j the record on appeal is not entirely clear as to the district courts exact rulings regarding these two motions the court of appeals concluded however that the district court had issued an order in limine prohibiting certain allen evidence eg lefferts formula but then permitted the prohibited evidence at trial griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   the record discloses that significant amounts of allens information concerning lefferts report including lefferts formula were presented to the jury at trial after  days of trial in which  witnesses testified griffin dismissed all of the claims against american suzuki motors corporation the jury rendered a liability verdict allocating  of the responsibility to wendy and  to suzuki the parties stipulated to latashas past and future economic and noneconomic damages this resulted in a final judgment for latasha against suzuki in the amount of  analysis standard of review the court of appeals agreed with griffin and determined its standard of review for the two evidentiarybased issues on appeal was abuse of discretion citing among other cases floyd v general motors corp  kan app d    pd  rev denied  kan   and dipietro v cessna aircraft co  kan app d    pd   rev denied  kan   we disagree with this reliance and the court of appeals conclusion in the instant case for the reasons set forth below we agree with suzuki and hold that our review is de novo at the outset we observe there is no dispute that the evidence at issue is relevant our threshold consideration when examining appellate challenges to a district courts admission of evidence see state v carter  kan    pd   generally all relevant evidence is admissible ksa f state v meeks  kan    pd   although the evidence is relevant overriding considerations of policy eg kansas statutes may require its exclusion see city of wichita v sealpak co  kan    pd   citing  gard  casads kansas c civ proc th annot §   the trier of fact should have all of the relevant evidence which is offered unless some overriding consideration of policy or expediency requires its exclusion suzuki argues that the statute ksa  absolutely requires exclusion from evidence the j vehicle and certain of lefferts information in other words there is no room for judicial discretion accordingly we must interpret this statute the interpretation of a statute is a question of law and this courts review is unlimited an appellate court is not bound by the district courts interpretation state v white  kan    pd   interpretation of the evidentiary statute ksa  is a question of law additionally if we conclude the evidence is excluded by statute the district court is generally prohibited from admitting it ie there is no discretion to admit in hess v st francis regional med center  kan   pd   this court held that per ksa  and  offers and acceptances of settlements are generally inadmissible and the admission of the evidence of settlement was not within the discretion permitted a trial court  kan at  ksa  evidence of liability insurance inadmissible to prove negligence or other wrongdoingsee also huxol v nickell  kan  syl ¶   pd   under ksa  evidence of subsequent remedial conduct inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with specific event finally we have observed that even abuse of discretion standards can sometimes more accurately be characterized as questions of law requiring de novo review state v white  kan    pd   there we cited among other things koon v united states  us    l ed d   s ct   which stated little turns however on whether we label review of this particular question abuse of discretion or de novo for an abuse of discretion standard does not mean a mistake of law is beyond appellate correction a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law    the abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions accord dragon v vanguard industries inc  kan    pd   abuse is found when district court has gone outside the framework of statutory limitations discussion issue  did the district court admit evidence in violation of ksa a because it allowed the j vehicle vitara as a reasonable alternative design to the j vehicle sidekick our analysis begins with the statute ksa  provides a in a product liability claim the following evidence shall not be admissible for any purpose  evidence of any advancements or changes in technical or other knowledge or techniques in design theory or philosophy in manufacturing or testing knowledge techniques or processes in labeling warning of risk or hazards instructions for the use of such product if such advancements or changes have been made learned or placed into common use subsequent to the time the product in issue was designed formulated tested manufactured or sold by the manufacturer and  evidence of any changes made in the designing planning formulating testing preparing manufacturing packaging warnings labeling or instructing for use of or with regard to the product in issue or any similar product which changes were made subsequent to the time the product in issue was designed formulated tested manufactured or sold by the manufacturer b this section does not require the exclusion of evidence of a subsequent measure if offered to impeach a witness for the manufacturer or seller of a product who has expressly denied the feasibility of such a measure emphasis added to help prove griffins theory of liability of the js  sidekick dangerous and defective design she intended to place in evidence the j as her reasonable alternative design evidence of a reasonable alternative design in products liability litigation is allowed in kansas as this court stated in delaney v deere and co  kan    pd   while the final test is one of consumer expectations in a products liability case involving a claimed design defect the parties    may present evidence as to    the feasibility of a safer design likewise evidence may be introduced as to the importance of the need or needs served by the product and its design the technical and economic feasibility and practicability of serving those needs with a safer design and the availability of other products if any to serve the same needs citation omitted suzuki argues that the j evidence is prohibited by ksa a as italicized above consequently on march   suzuki filed a motion in limine to exclude all references to the new design of the chevrolet tracker and the suzuki vitara introduced in the  model year also referred to as the j vehicle which succeeded the j geo tracker and suzuki sidekick sold in various configurations between the  model years in support of its motion suzuki made allegations in support of its apparent argument that the changes from the j to the j were design changes eg subsequent remedial measures which were inadmissible it stated in relevant part  it is anticipated that plaintiffs will attempt to suggest that design changes made to the j chevrolet tracker and the suzuki vitara are admissible in this action as a subsequent remedial measure  it is also anticipated that plaintiffs will attempt to admit and discuss in front of the jury rollover testing of a j vitara conducted in  by their expert john marcosky as an attempted comparison of its performance to that of the  fourdoor sidekick  as a general rule evidence of subsequent remedial measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct ksa a ksa  floyd v general motors corp  kan app d    pd   patton v hutchinson wilrich manufacturing co  kan    pd   indeed in kansas product liability litigation evidence of subsequent remedial measures shall not be admissible for any purpose with the only exception being to impeach the testimony of a witness for the manufacturer or seller who has expressly denied the feasibility of the proposed remedial measure ksa b dipietro v cessna aircraft co  kan app d    pd    sic defendants do not deny the feasibility of the design changes made in the j vehicles and none of their experts is expected to deny the feasibility of these changes suzuki also appeared to argue that the changes were not design changes because the j represented a wholly new design accordingly they were irrelevant and therefore inadmissible  also the j suzuki vitara and chevrolet tracker represent not a design change but a wholly new design as such their new design is irrelevant to the design of the subject  fourdoor sidekick see inoue affidavit appendix exhibit b to defendant gms motion for summary judgment  kansas courts have recognized that evidence involving other vehicles not similar to the vehicle at issue in a suit may properly be excluded as irrelevant    betts v general motors corporation  kan   pd      floyd v general motors corp  kan app d    pd    numerous jurisdictions have likewise recognized that evidence in product liability cases should be limited to models which are the same or substantially similar to the subject model citations omitted  in this case the only similarity between the  fourdoor sidekick and the j suzuki vitara is that they are both sport utility vehicles plaintiffs simply cannot present any evidence of substantial similarity between the two models apropos of plaintiffs claim that a defect in the  fourdoor sidekick led to plaintiffs accident defendants note that the  fourdoor sidekick and j vitara have different track widths suspensions steering systems and other components but that there is no evidence that any of these new design features was instituted to correct any deficiency in the handlingstability or rollover resistance of the j sidekick as such they are not substantially similar and any evidence relating to the j chevrolet tracker or suzuki vitara is irrelevant  plaintiffs attempts to refer to the new design of the j chevrolet tracker or suzuki vitara are made only with one purpose in mind – to alienate the jurors from the defendants griffin responded on april  that ksa  and a did not apply she pointed out that the j incorporated several of the design features that plaintiffs experts would testify should have been part of the original rollover resistance design parameters and characteristics of the j as a result the j was evidence of reasonable alternative design recommended by her experts she therefore argued that plaintiffs should not be precluded from presenting evidence of their reasonable alternative design simply because that design was incorporated in a vehicle designed and manufactured by defendants griffin characterized the j as the plaintiffs go to vehicle with regard to rollover resistance design parameters characteristics and performance she specifically argued ksa  ie subsequent remedial conduct did not apply because suzukis witnesses had testified that the change was not remedial but a wholly new design moreover according to griffin ksa a did not render the j evidence inadmissible since suzuki admitted that the j represents not a design change but a wholly new design and that the j and j are not substantially similar as a result under the statute the j was not evidence of any changes made in designing    the product in issue or any similar product      she argued that defendants could not have it both ways ie could not assert in their pleadings that the j is not the product in issue and is not a similar product and still assert that griffins j evidence is inadmissible pursuant to ksa  at the april  hearing on the motion suzuki clarified that it was arguing in the alternative it claimed that griffin either had to prove that the j and j vehicles were substantially similar in which case  barred the evidence of the j or if griffin could not show that the vehicles were substantially similar then the j evidence was not relevant griffin responded that suzuki had to be held to its pleadings where it stated that the j was not the product in issue or a similar product that the j does not incorporate design changes but is a wholly new design and that there is no evidence of substantial similarity between the j and the j the district court ruled at the april  hearing i put a lot of thought and a lot of research into this and quite frankly folks this court feels that the main contingent in this matter is that the goto vehicle is a vehicle and that was produced by and manufactured by the defendants so i do consider that or would this argument be going on if this was gm or chrysler or ford or someone in that regard statute is very clear is it the product in question its been specifically denied and the defendant – and the plaintiff is not saying that it is and the defendant has stated that its a wholly different vehicle is it similar again its a wholly different vehicle and the court feels that the plaintiff has the right and opportunity as the case law would dictate that they have the right to present a reasonable alternative design this court has not heard that information as to – and believes that to be a question of fact for the jury as to whether or not that is a reasonable alternative design but for those reasons and a literal reading of a this court will deny the motion in limine in that regard emphasis added on april   suzuki then filed a motion to reconsider the denial of its motion in limine it continued to argue that the j and j are similar products under  and therefore the j evidence should be excluded as support it stated the sidekick design was  years old so suzuki replaced the sidekick with a new second generation design – the vitara it is not the same vehicle but it is a new design for suzukis small suv product ie a similar product suzuki attached to its motion a deposition excerpt from a suzuki representative masatoshi nakamura who testified that the j is a first generation tracker and sidekick he also testified that the j is a second generation tracker and the vitara as in suzukis initial motion in limine it again referenced the affidavit from suzuki engineer yoshihisa inoue griffin responded that defendants arguments did not change the basic fact – the j is evidence of a vehicle that incorporates plaintiffs reasonable alternative design goto vehicle and is not evidence of a design change in the j but rather is a wholly new design at the april  hearing on the motion to reconsider suzuki also argued that excluding its j did not prohibit plaintiffs experts from asserting an alternative design rather the experts simply could not use suzukis j as the alternative design to suzukis j sidekick it also emphasized that suzukis substantial improvements and changes did not detract from the fact that the j was simply the second generation of the j and became suzukis successor small suv after hearing oral arguments on the motion to reconsider the district court appeared to clarify its earlier ruling it stated it was not relying upon similaritydissimilarity rather  did not exclude evidence of the j because the j was not a change in the j but was a wholly new design court again knows that this is a very sensitive issue in this case and as such has delved and given it quite a little bit of time folks ive reviewed the material from the last hearing the case law and or course the motion of the defendant in this case which was very informative but the courts opinion does not change the court did not make this determination of js admissibility on finding that the tracker or the vitara are not similar vehicles the court made this decision in applying a to the facts in this case the facts in this case are that defendants have alleged that one this was not a change in design and two is not a similar vehicle but again a wholly different design not an upgrade not an alteration not a design change or planning or formulating testing preparing manufacturing all of those things it is not a change in any of that its a wholly new design as such based upon that this court has found and will still find that a has its place but its not in this case the facts do not – that have been presented to this court are different than the facts and the inadmissible evidence that is considered and should be kept out of a the reason being – again ill be very clear this is not evidence of a design change and its a wholly new design court will find that a for those reasons is not applicable evidence comes in emphasis added on may   –  days before trial began – suzuki filed a brief in support of its evidentiary objections regarding the j it argued that because the court had twice ruled the evidence of the j was admissible because it was a wholly new design and therefore not similar to the j then the evidence consequently had to be irrelevant to whether the j had been defectively designed in short it renewed its alternative position from the original motion in limine it again cited the yoshihisa inoue affidavit to argue the j was dissimilar the court denied the requested relief essentially concluding that the designs of the two vehicles were wholly different that they therefore did not constitute changes and that as a result the j evidence was not excluded by  accordingly at trial the jury heard testimony from yet another suzuki representative engineer eiji mochizuki during griffins case in chief he testified through a translator that the j vehicle is a completely new design the j had a trucklike ride with a four passenger capacity while the j had a fivepassenger capacity and was developed to be like a passenger car with a powerful engine a good ride and quiet operation the court of appeals held the admission of the j evidence was reversible error in doing so it focused on the similarities between the j and the j concluding that ample evidence of product similarity was presented at trial griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   it then described in some detail the similarities between the vehicles the court seemingly rejected griffins argument that the statements in suzukis motions were counsels binding admissions and also that any error was invited by suzuki we disagree with this approach because the determination of a wholly different design was a preliminary finding of fact necessary to an evidentiary ruling made by the district court searching the record for evidence to the contrary exceeds the scope of an appellate courts authority as explained below before this court griffin continues to devote considerable effort to argue that suzuki is conclusively bound by its statements appearing in its initial motion in limine on the issue she argues suzukis counsel made a binding admission regarding wholly new design specifically by paragraphs six and nine of its motion and strongly suggests suzuki is estopped from arguing otherwise she cites among other cases in re estate of carrell  kan    pd   likewise suzuki continues to devote nearly the same considerable effort to argue the admission was merely an alternative pleading suggesting it was not a fact but a legal argument we need not address the parties detailed positions regarding the effect of suzukis counsels statements and arguments in suzukis motions because the district courts finding is supported by the pretrial affidavit of suzukis yoshihisa inoue his affidavit dated february   was referenced in suzukis own motion in limine as well as in its motion to reconsider and had been provided to the district court as exhibit f to suzukis response to plaintiffs motion to add a claim for punitive damages on march   it provided in relevant part     all of these vehicles eg j and j are differently designed vehicles with different design concepts and different design programs      the j vehicles were designed as replacements for the j vehicles in part because the j vehicles reflected designs that were more than  years old smc designed the j vehicles from the ground up and incorporated new design features not found in the j vehicles  from an engineering and design standpoint the j and j vehicles are substantially different the center of gravity height curb weight gross vehicle weight rating overall length interior occupant space cargo space fuel tank capacity body structure chassis frame suspension setting and other numerous significant design details differ between the j and j vehicles  the j and j vehicles were designed and developed at different times there were different design concepts for the j and j vehicles and the j and j vehicles were developed in different design programs emphasis added because the courts determination that the j was a wholly new design is a finding of fact it is subject to a substantial competent evidence standard substantial evidence is that which possesses both relevance and substance and which furnishes a substantial basis of fact from which the issues can reasonably be resolved usd no  v kansas assn of american educators  kan    pd   on appeal we do not weigh conflicting evidence pass on the credibility of witnesses or redetermine questions of fact we also accept as true all inferences to be drawn from the evidence which support or tend to support the findings of the district court  kan at  after reviewing the inoue affidavit we conclude the district courts pretrial finding is supported by substantial competent evidence our affirmation of the district courts factual finding that the j was a wholly different design however merely leads us to the second major step in our analysis determining whether evidence of a wholly different design is excluded by ksa a we first observe that ksa a makes inadmissible for any purpose evidence of any changes made in the designing    of    the product in issue or any similar product     emphasis added the district courts interpretation essentially provides that a wholly different design cannot constitute any changes in the original design as mentioned the interpretation of a statute is a question of law our review is unlimited and this court is not bound by the district courts interpretation state v white  kan    pd   the fundamental rule to which all other rules are subordinate is that the intent of the legislature governs if that intent can be ascertained and when a statute is plain and unambiguous the court must give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed rather than determine what the law should or should not be schmidtlien electric inc v greathouse  kan    pd   intent of the legislature is to be derived in the first place from the words used mccraw v city of merriam  kan    pd   when construing a statute a court should give words in common usage their natural and ordinary meaning schmidtlien electric inc v greathouse  kan at  the face of the statute makes it clear that any change in the design of a product made after the product is designed formulated tested manufactured or sold is inadmissible for any purpose except to meet a defendants denial of feasibility as suzuki correctly observes in its brief websters new collegiate dictionary  defines change as including to make different in some particular and to replace one with another and to make a shift from one to another accordingly we hold that a change in design in a manufacturers small suv would encompass a wholly different design manifested in the same manufacturers later generation small suv serving as a replacement to the original – particularly when as here the two generations of vehicles are similar enough to render the later vehicle relevant as evidence for comparative purposes under the doctrine expressed in betts v general motors corp  kan    pd   and floyd v general motors corp  kan app d    pd   although not necessary to our resolution of the issue we observe that our holding is also consistent with the purposes of the kpla similarly without our determining that ksa a was ambiguous in patton v hutchinson wilrich mfg co  kan   pd   we discussed its purposes and some legislative history patton was a product liability case involving a field cultivator according to the patton court the kpla became effective july   and is based on the model uniform product liability act patton v hutchinson wilrich mfg co  kan at  the purpose of the model act was to consolidate all product liability actions regardless of theory into one theory of legal liability  kan at  ksa  however was not passed until  see vargo the emperors new clothes the american law institute adorns a new cloth for section a products liability design defects – a survey of the states reveals a different weave  u mem l rev   winter  in  kansas adopted a comprehensive products liability act which severely limited consumers rights the  act was amended several times to extend its anticonsumer aspects the patton court highlighted the following from some of the  amendments legislative history legislative hearings on sb  ksa  supp  included a statement from the president of the senate senator robert v talkington who supported the bills passage i encourage the committee to support a bill which would prohibit the admission into evidence during court proceedings of information related to normal advancements or changes in knowledge or techniques of production design theory and packaging of products normal product changes are a result of the growth of knowledge and not a desire to coverup design inadequacies passage of this measure would not mean victims of poorly designed products would be unable to seek and achieve compensation for injuries sustained from proper use of such products what sb  would do is prevent the mere change of a product or product package being construed in court as an implicit acknowledgment that the original design was defective i urge the committee to support this bill to provide an additional element of fairness in our judicial process and encourage economic development and growth in kansas minutes of senate judiciary committee march   aii emphasis added  kan at  the patton court immediately thereafter concluded we believe that  is an attempt to codify the wide variety of circumstances that may occur under the rule that excludes evidence of subsequent remedial procedures see wheeler v john deere co  fd   n th cir farm combine strict product liability case ksa  supp  encourages manufacturers to make their products as safe as possible free from the fear that remedial measures will be used adversely in later litigation see also ksa  relating to subsequent remedial conduct we view  as a stateoftheart statute which prohibits the introduction of postmanufacture remedial measures except as provided by b evidence allowed to impeach a witness after a manufacturers or sellers express denial of the feasibility of the remedial measure see siruta v hesston corp  kan    pd   for our approval of the admissibility of feasibility evidence before the enactment of  we consider the following to be the operative language in the context of the case at bar if such advancements or changes have been made learned or placed into common use subsequent to the time the product in issue was    sold by the manufacturer ksa  supp  a patton  kan at  the patton court also identified the public policy contained in the kpla stating the legislature in the kpla has clearly declared the public policy of the state the policy is to limit the rights of plaintiffs to recover in product liability suits generally and to judge a product for an alleged defect only when it is first sold  kan at  the patton court which addressed allegations of a farm implement manufacturers postsale duty to warn also examined the negative practical consequences of accepting an argument by its plaintiff stating wellmade farm implements last a long time durability would be perceived by manufacturers as a negative factor if manufacturers were subjected to postsale duties the rule of law patton seeks to have us adopt will stifle technology and suppress product safety development under pattons scenario a manufacturer would be far safer to design a machine intended to wear out in a few years replacement would be required more often and more machines albeit inferior ones would be sold pride of product design and improvement would become secondary to fear of liability farmers and implement manufacturers would both be losers  kan at  emphasis added to accept griffins statutory interpretation is to send a similar stifling and suppressing message to manufacturers ie that their design changes should be incremental and not extensive in other words there should be no wholly different designs no wholesale innovations and no successor generations of improved product – even though the extensive changes could be safer and perhaps cheaper for the consumer if introduced now as noted in patton pride of product design and improvement would become secondary to fear of liability consumers and vehicle manufacturers would both be losers accepting griffins statutory interpretation also is inconsistent with our statement in patton that ksa  supp  prohibits the admission  of subsequent product improvements and  for any purpose not only product design improvements but also later acquired knowledge as to warnings and hazards emphasis added  kan at  such an interpretation is also inconsistent with the legislative history quoted there a bill which would prohibit the admission into evidence during court proceedings of information related to normal advancements or changes in    design theory emphasis added  kan at  as in griffins pretrial arguments she reminds us that she is merely trying to use the j as her reasonable alternative design to show the j was in a defective condition as is allowed by kansas law she argues the j evidence was specifically used by her expert witness allen to demonstrate the feasibility adequacy and effectiveness of his reasonable alternative design and should not be prohibited merely because it too is suzukis product as in suzukis pretrial motions it responds that a reasonable alternative design is not required and that griffin may utilize one as long as it is not suzukis successor or replacement small suv we agree with suzuki griffins experts may still assert their alternative designs including the same changes that may be found in the j but the kansas legislature has precluded from evidence the fact that those designs may now be found in a subsequent suzuki product ksa  is clear design changes cannot be used for any purpose except to meet a manufacturers allegation that the changes are not feasible and suzuki has never claimed lack of feasibility in short allowing a manufacturers later product to be introduced into evidence as a reasonable alternative design to the manufacturers original product could lead a jury to wrongly conclude the later product is substantial proof that the earlier was defective and that the later product repaired this defect with its new design this path is contrary to the basic theme contained in  cf patton v hutchinson wilrich mfg co  kan at  we believe that  is an attempt to codify the wide variety of circumstances that may occur under the rule that excludes evidence of subsequent remedial procedures effect of trial errors given the erroneous admission of the j evidence the remaining determination is whether its admission was harmless or reversible error ksa  states in relevant part no error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence    is ground for granting a new trial    unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice the court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties this court has previously held that harmless error is that which does not prejudice the substantial rights of a party hagedorn v stormontvail regional med center  kan    pd   erroneous admission of evidence the court of appeals although differing from this court on the appropriate standard of review concluded that the admission of this evidence constituted reversible error because of the huge role it played at trial griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   as the court explained in opening remarks griffins counsel told the jury that it was technologically and economically feasible to build to design and build and manufacture the  suzuki sidekick with the same rollover resistance design features as the j the  through  suzuki vitara and geo tracker    griffins expert allen testified that the j vehicle failed the three methods for evaluating rollover resistance while the j passed two tests and there was insufficient data about the third allen went on at length about the differences in design safety features of the j and j during griffins closing the jury was told that wendy would be alive and latasha would not be in a wheelchair had wendy been driving a j vehicle at the time of the accident griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   allen also testified that the j had an unreasonably dangerous and defective rollover resistance design which contributed to the rollover accident he concluded that the js rollover resistance performance would have been enhanced by incorporating a wider track width utilizing a stiffer antirollbar and adding a cross brace between the left and right strut towers griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   he also testified that in his opinion the j design was a reliable alternative design as it possessed those three attributes missing in the j and would in his opinion minimize the vehicles rollover propensity it was allens opinion that had wendy been driving a j vehicle at the time of the accident the vehicle would have maintained directional stability would not have left the road and would not have tipped over griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   a further review of the record reveals that griffins counsel told the jury that suzuki had adopted her experts recommended design changes to the j in the design of the j and reminded them that the j unlike the j did not roll over in its testing allen testified that test reports supported his opinion about the design of the suzuki sidekick and the alternative designs that he recommended that are incorporated in the j in short we agree with suzuki that griffin encouraged the jury to conclude that by making the design changes in the j suzuki had effectively conceded that griffins expert was right – that design changes in the j were necessary that suzuki had known it since before  when the sidekick had been manufactured and that the j design specifically was the fix for the alleged defects in the j design we therefore conclude like the court of appeals that the error is reversible issue  did the district court admit evidence in violation of ksa a because it allowed testing and engineering standards not in use when the  sidekick was manufactured both of suzukis additional motions in limine concerned an april   general motors corporation nao evaluation report entitled analysis of effects of engineering parameters on field rollover rates written by gm engineer ronald l leffert the first motion defendants motion to limit opinions of plaintiffs expert wade allen was filed march   it sought to prohibit allen from testifying about any opinions formed by his reliance upon lefferts report the second motion defendants motion in limine to exclude the new gm vehicle technical specification for stability margin was filed april   it sought to exclude general motors new vehicle technical specifications for stability margin griffin filed responses to both motions which were argued along with the j motion on april  the heart of suzukis objections related to purported rollover resistance standards for vehicles with wheelbases less than  millimeters eg the j and j it argued that the formula which produces these standards ie purported minimum rollover safety margins was first published by leffert in his  report accordingly the standards and the formula represented advancements or changes in technical knowledge design theory and testing knowledge that were learned subsequent to the time the  sidekick was sold by the manufacturer and are therefore barred by ksa a griffin responded that lefferts analysis was admissible because it did not represent such advancements or changes she argued that lefferts analysis was not new knowledge because vehicle stability margin had been a concept used to evaluate rollover resistance design since  and that wheelbase had been considered as a parameter as early as  at oral argument griffin further argued that suzuki should have known that the short wheelbase enters into the stability margin formula griffin contended that lefferts analysis was the same work applying some new data that could have been done back in the early s or it could have been done at any point in time before this vehicle was sold in  griffin however conceded that in the early s companies were not using wheelbase in the formula that it was sort of discovered by mr leffert when he reviewed all this accident data she argued wade allen simply used lefferts accident data and the same analysis and they came to the same conclusions the district court seemed to deny suzukis first motion and sustain the second it stated but at this point in time that stability margin formula that the parties informed me was adopted in april of  involved a different formula that was not in existence prior to that time that has come up with a set of numbers that didnt exist prior to that time that motion will be sustained as to that narrow formula at this time emphasis added the apparent basis for the district courts exclusion as argued by suzuki was subsection a of ksa  which states in relevant part a in a product liability claim the following evidence shall not be admissible for any purpose  evidence of any advancements or changes in technical or other knowledge or techniques in design theory or philosophy in manufacturing or testing knowledge techniques or processes in labeling warning of risk or hazards instructions for the use of such product if such advancements or changes have been made learned or placed into common use subsequent to the time the product in issue was designed formulated tested manufactured or sold by the manufacturer emphasis added as mentioned the record on appeal is not entirely clear as to the district courts exact rulings and rationale technical terms were used interchangeably by almost everyone at crucial times throughout the litigation ie steady state reserve safety reserve safety margin stability margin steady state rollover propensity margin rollover safety margin minimum rollover safety margin vehicle technical specification short wheelbase calculation short wheelbase rollover safety margin calculation stability margin formula lefferts formula and schematics of the leffert formula these times included during the extensive april  pretrial hearings on the motions after the opening statements at trial and during allens direct examination the transcript discloses that during allens testimony experienced trial counsel were admittedly confused about the extent of the courts order in limine the court of appeals concluded that the district court had issued an order in limine prohibiting certain allen evidence eg lefferts formula for computing minimum rollover safety margin for short wheelbased vehicles but then permitted the prohibited evidence at trial regardless of the path taken significant amounts of witness allens information concerning lefferts report including lefferts formula were presented to the jury at trial the court of appeals held the error was reversible in our analysis we will focus on the evidence that was admitted not the paths to that admission griffins evidence included extensive testimony by her expert witness allen and exhibits  and  entitled vehicle rollover resistance performance parameters highly summarized her evidence showed a rollover safety margin calculated for the j and j door vehicles this rollover safety margin was the result of subtracting each vehicles maximum lateral acceleration from its side pull ratio which indicates how hard a person would have to corner a vehicle to get it to tip up based on acceleration due to gravity commonly known as g units this calculation provided a rollover safety margin of  for the j and a margin of  for the j evidence conclusively established that this particular formula had been known in the industry since the s griffins evidence however also revealed use of lefferts formula this formula consisted of dividing the figure of  by the square of a vehicles wheelbase allen testified that the formula originally was found in lefferts report dated april   lefferts report was listed as a reference in allens expert report and was marked as exhibit  which allen discussed during his testimony allen testified that in lefferts opinion this formula was needed to provide a better safety evaluation for short wheelbased vehicles than that which was provided by the rollover safety margin specifically a larger rollover safety margin was needed for vehicles with a wheelbase less than  millimeters according to allen leffert had come to this conclusion after looking at rollover statistics for shortwheelbased vehicles allen found this large amount of data relatively reliable according to allen the quotient resulting from the leffert formula – as derived from the analysis done in lefferts report – established a minimum rollover standard for vehicles with a wheelbase less than  millimeters he described it as a minimum rollover safety margin and testified that leffert used it in that way when allen was specifically asked for his opinion concerning an adequate rollover safety margin for a vehicle with a wheelbase of less than  millimeters he stated well leffert gives us a formula – and his formula is  divided by the square of the wheelbase    by itself and then you divide that into  and he leffert says that the safety margin should be greater than that number allen readily agreed lefferts formula was a good way to analyze the rollover safety margin for a short wheelbase vehicle and that adequate rollover safety margin makes it less likely the vehicle would tip when allen used lefferts formula to calculate the minimum standard for a vehicle possessing the same short wheelbase as the j his calculations yielded the figure of  as mentioned however according to exhibits  and  the js actual rollover safety margin was  – which allen testified was below that number that leffert tells us should be used for this particular vehicle by contrast allens testimony along with exhibits  and  showed that the js actual rollover safety margin of  was well above lefferts calculated minimum of  as allen pointed out to the jury the j more than doubled the tip up margin of the j  versus  he concluded that the j failed in the rollover margin evaluation but that the j did not the record establishes that before the publication of the leffert report and formula in  there was no test that purported to quantify the effect of a shorter wheelbase on rollover resistance clearly no minimum rollover safety margin had been defined based on a vehicles wheelbase the minimum rollover safety margin for vehicles with shorter wheelbases as determined by the leffert formula contained in the leffert report is clearly an advancement in technical testing knowledge that was learned subsequent to the time the  sidekick was sold by the manufacturer we therefore agree with suzuki that although lefferts formula was not a standard of testing in  the implication was made that suzuki was laggard and culpable in  for not designing a vehicle that would pass a test that did not then exist accordingly we agree with the court of appeals that ksa a prohibits such evidence lefferts minimum margin calculated by allen to be  as well as evidence of lefferts formula should have been excluded by the district court griffin argues that suzuki did not preserve this evidentiary error for appeal specifically she claims that though the court may have granted suzukis motion in limine suzuki made no contemporaneous objection to allens testimony the morning of may  that the short wheelbase formula was one appropriate evaluation of the rollover stability of a short wheelbase vehicle she cites state v decker  kan    pd   if a motion in limine is granted to preclude the introduction of certain evidence the later failure to object at trial results in the issue not being preserved on appeal while she admits that during the afternoon session on may  when allen provided additional testimony concerning the short wheelbase formula that suzukis counsel did object that it violated the district courts order in limine she complains that suzuki did not also move to strike or request the jury to disregard such evidence she suggests such requests are requirements for preserving the objection citing state v campbell  kan    pd   we agree with suzuki that we need not address griffins arguments because her contemporaneous objection issue was not raised below it does not appear in her brief to the court of appeals or in her petition for review setting forth the issues she wanted to argue to this court in the event her petition was granted it appeared for the first time in her brief to this court raising her argument now conflicts with supreme court rule g  kan ct r annot  and our decision in telegram publishing v kansas dept of transportation  kan    pd   citing hephner v traders ins co  kan     pd   issues cannot be raised for the first time at this level we also observe that suzuki had been granted a continuing objection to the leffert information before trial began in conjunction with its motion in limine thus suzukis issue was preserved for appeal a very similar situation occurred in state v parker  kan    pd   where we stated where the trial court has granted counsels request for a continuing objection to evidence excluded by an order in limine the trial court is in a position to avert error on account of the introduction of objectionable evidence thus the rationale underlying the contemporaneous objection rule has been met and the issue is preserved for appeal effect of trial errors we also agree with the court of appeals that the admission of the leffert evidence was not harmless under ksa  griffin v suzuki motor corp no  unpublished opinion filed february   during a week jury trial in which a considerable amount of conflicting and at times confusing engineering studies and other scientific evidence is presented by both sides a jury could easily seize upon perceived certainties such as mathematically computed minimum rollover standards of safety for short wheelbased vehicles that an expert witness testifies should have been met the jury could then just as easily conclude that when the j vehicles mathematically computed rollover safety margin fell approximately  below these purported minimum rollover standards the vehicle is inadequate and therefore unsafe this was certainly a major tenet of allens testimony we hold that this evidence prejudiced the substantial rights of suzuki see hagedorn v stormontvail regional medical center  kan    pd   the problem of the mathematically inadequate j is exacerbated by the testimony and exhibits demonstrating that the js margin is not only double that of the js but also that the js margin exceeds lefferts minimum standards for short wheelbased vehicles by approximately  this comparison of vehicles relates back to the problem discussed in issue  the prejudicial use of a companys later product to prove its predecessor was defectively designed the court of appeals is affirmed the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for new trial allegrucci j dissenting end   kansas opinions    finding aids case name » supreme court or court of appeals  docket number  release date  comments to webmaster

american suzuki motor corp told caranddrivercom in a recent interview the hybrid system will bow on an allnew product mr suzuki said the preference is to launch the system in a car as opposed to a sportutility vehicle were thinking a future premium sedan which we suspect to be in the works for suzuki is a good candidate as for suzukis continued wish for an icon it looks like that mantle will not fall to a roadster anytime soon the automaker will instead focus on its wrc participation in the summer of  with an sx not that a roadster wouldnt be nice mr suzuki said but it would take a lot of work and simply is not a priority at this time well have to make due with scaleddown dreams of the tiny swift the next generation is destined for american shores in —but only the fivedoor version other parts of the world get a threedoor mr suzuki insists there is room for both the swift and the sx which rides on a stretched swift platform in the interim the automaker has increased sx
