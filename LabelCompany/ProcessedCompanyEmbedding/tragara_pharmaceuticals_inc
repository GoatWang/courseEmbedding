presentations            ·kinases in cancer bibliography tg oncogenic survival protein depletion via kinase inhibition summary tg is a novel orally available small molecule that targets  equipotently  the major signaling pathways involving erk jak and key cell cycle and transcriptional cyclindependent kinases cdks with excellent pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties preclinical models demonstrate that tg has the unique ability to deplete the shortlived survival proteins mcl and xiap and maintain this depletion for greater than  hours after a single dose producing and promoting apoptosis programmed cell death to occur importantly the mechanism of action for tg functions independently of p status which could provide benefit to patients with poor prognosis genotypes that are resistant to many standardofcare drugs in a study recently presented at aacr researchers at md anderson demonstrated that the apoptotic activity of tg was due to its potent inhibition of cdk  and  which blocks transcription and results in the depletion of shortlived antiapoptotic proteins to which many tumor cells are dependent such as mcl and xiap maintaining this depletion for  hours induces high levels of apoptosis tg’s oral dosing flexibility and supportive pharmacokinetic profile provide the capability to effectively sustain this depletion previous efforts by some other drugs to modulate mcl have fallen short in part due to pharmaceutical and pharmacodynamic limitations in addition this mechanism makes tg an attractive companion for combination therapy depletion of survival proteins also lowers the apoptotic threshold for other anticancer drugs including chemotherapy and targeted agents whose therapeutic benefit is often reduced or eliminated in the presence of overexpressed mcl the utility of this mechanism has been demonstrated in multiple in vivo hematological and solid tumor models where tg has shown synergy with a variety of standardofcare agents tragara is focusing its first phase of tg product development on multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia because of the consistent antitumor activity that was observed across a broad spectrum of models in our preclinical profiling program including those resistant to currently available therapies these models demonstrated that tg has the unique ability to deplete mcl and other survival proteins through its pindependent cdk activity resulting in both single agent activity and synergy when administered with current standard of care therapies subsequent development will focus on a unique group of solid tumors with unmet medical need which will also benefit from this mechanism of action complemented with the benefits of inhibiting jak and erk sclc tnbc melanoma hcc tg phase i singleagent development is completed in acute leukemias and is underway in myeloma to date tg has exhibited dose proportional exposure over a range of doses and schedules with a manageable safety profile tragara is continuing its dose escalation in this program and is expected to achieve the maximum tolerated dose mtd and recommended singleagent phase  dose rpd in late early  while the mtd has yet to be reached and associated with a rpd biological activity has been observed tragara has initiated a new phase i study in cll in october  in early  tg was selected by the multiple myeloma
