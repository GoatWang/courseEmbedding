range of maturities to match your sales cycles you can request city national bank to issue a term letter of credit ie payable  days after sight thus postponing the debit to your account until maturity we can still pay the exporter at sight however since the transaction can be financed at a rate the discount rate less than a traditional credit facility why banks are not required to provide reserves for financing such transactions and since acceptances are extremely liquid the bank readily has access to a lowercost source of funds incoming documentary collections our proven capability in documentary collections ensures you and your supplier control over the shipping and financial documents that will result in more efficient predictable payment import collections are most secure when both buyer and seller have developed a comfortable level of mutual trust and understanding the importer will be required to either pay dp or accept da the draft in order to take possession of the goods thereby avoiding tieup of valuable credit lines foreign draft mailing payments overseas city national bank drafts are drawn on major banks in the country of the currency and cleared through

their own or for companies with large singlesale transactions this mechanism essentially transfers the payment in the letter of credit to a third party  your supplier in so doing it enables you to use the first buyers credit and buy the goods without using your credit line it is important to note that the wording in the letter of credit itself must expressly state or be designated as transferable assignments of export letter of credit proceeds when your vendor asks for more assurance of payment for supplies or materials that are used in your export shipment offer an assignment of proceeds from your letter of credit immediately upon our receipt of payment from your letter of credit we will directly pay your vendor the portion you assigned bankers acceptance financing of exports let city
