the fields of pulmonary medicine cardiology neuroscience physiology and immunology in  the nobel prize in medicine was awarded for discoveries concerning no as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system inhaled nitric oxide is presently used to treat thousands of patients per year in the us including term infants with pulmonary hypertension and some preterm infants with respiratory insufficiency inhaled nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary specific vasodilator that dilates blood vessels numerous academic sponsored clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical utility of no and potential uses for no in an extensive variety of diseases and health complications including inflammatory disorders head trauma erectile dysfunction pain and neuroprotection once inhaled into the lungs no causes blood vessels to relax and widen resulting in an increase in blood flow this increase in blood flow allows tissues to receive more oxygen once tissues receive more oxygen the cells within the tissues become available to provide energy for all activities that organisms perform both actively and passively no exerts its’ properties locally and is metabolized quickly thus minimizing systemic adverse reactions associated with other vasodilators vasodilator therapies are widely used in hospital settings for patients with pulmonary and cardiac diseases although these therapies are both safe and effective they are cumbersome to use and prohibitively expensive because of the lack of transportability and the expense no is not often used in underdeveloped countries where there is significant need for no therapy current providers of no use large tanks of compressed gas that contain no diluted in pure nitrogen numed believes there is a significant marketplace for its’ inhaled no medical therapies currently available no delivery systems are a concern for hospitals due to usage tracking storage and the necessity of returning empty compressed gas tanks in

the company was incorporated in october  in the state of utah as an early stage emerging growth company to develop manufacture and market new technologies in the medical device field numeds immediate focus is on the creation of a nitric oxide powder formulation along with a bedside nitric oxide generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver nitric oxide gas numed is headquartered in salt lake city utah business the mission of numed is to design develop and market technologies in the medical device field our technologies will focus on market niches in high growth trend areas we hope each developed technology will fill a current need in medical procedures by improving upon an existing technology or device or by designing a device to serve a need that is clearly defined and acknowledged by medical professionals numed intends to become a medical device company principally engaged in the design innovation development enhancement and commercialization of beginning early and selective laterstage quality medical devices our immediate focus is on the creation of a nitric oxide powder formulation a hospital bedside nitric oxide no generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver nitric oxide gas to offer solutions to hospitals health systems and the medical community throughout the world prior to the founding of numed plus our core team jeff robins william moon and dr craig morrison investigated researched and worked on initial formulations of a conceptual product to convert nitric oxide from a proprietary formulation to a gas used to in the medical field based on our teams backgrounds in the field of mechanical engineering chemistry and medicine it was determined a potential niche market existed and the conceptual proprietary product could possibly be created from this initial research and some initial testing our team believed we could create a mechanical device that could deliver nitric oxide to medical patients and use a new formulation of nitric oxide that when combined with the new delivery device could be accomplished in a more economical method than those currently in existence recognizing the experimental nature of the intended product and the time and money commitments to get such a product to market the team spent almost a year working on various initial equipment and formulizations before determining they could not proceed further without some additional capital from this realization of the need for capital numed was incorporated and an initial private placement was completed to raise some capital to create a small lab and purchase equipment including chemicals to start working on testing the theories of the founding team even with almost a year of working on the proposed product and formulation numed recognizes the difficulty in developing a medical product and that other companies could expend far more resources on a similar solution and beat numed to the market investors in numed face tremendous risk and would be betting on current management and its development staff which have not had prior success in developing and marketing medical products although management believes they are developing a unique and economical solution for nitric oxide delivery management acknowledges they have not developed medical products before and all of their prior development work has been for other companies and this will be the first time management and their team have tried to do so without the support of a large organization and such organizations funding capabilities the core of the product embodiment is the kinetically controlled release of nitric oxide from a chemical reaction the mechanical means to deliver a metered dose to a patient is of secondary concern and will be addressed once the nitric oxide generation has been optimized a research laboratory completed in july  has been equipped with  the appropriate safety measures negative pressure fume hood nitric oxide analyzer and standard lab ware to assess chemical reactions that produce nitric oxide the initial goal is developing a kinetic control and be able to complete testing to optimize the process initial efforts are focusing on a proprietary mixture that will show the requisite parameters for generating nitric oxide in a controlled manner once this stage of development is complete we will move forward with additional development of the delivery system the optimization may take an unknown direction that will necessitate changes in the anticipated design of the mechanical delivery apparatus additionally unforeseen delays such as obtaining needed chemicals which we experienced in september and october of  can hamper development timelines management believes it will take some time before a product will be finalized and testing completed until a final product is completed and testing done no assurance can be given we will be able to complete the product or achieve the costs savings for the patient liquidity and capital resources at march   we had assets of  with current assets of  and liabilities of  our current assets consisted primarily of prepaid expenses in the amount of  and cash of only  we currently do not have the cash to pay ongoing expenses and have had to rely on loans from shareholders to cover expenses without additional capital we will not be able to stay in business and move our business plan forward we anticipate based on our preliminary budgets that we will need  in additional financing for the next twelve months to cover just our corporate overhead and need another  to cover ongoing product development in april  we entered into a stock subscription agreements with two investors for them to purchase up to  of common stock at a price of  per share the total proceeds received from the subscription agreement total  with the balance to be paid over the next three months since we will not have a commercial product in the next twelve months we will have to rely on outside funding to support our operations and product development and testing efforts given the financial state of numed we will not be able to seek traditional bank financing and have to rely on private stock sales as we did in  as well as potential loans from investors and shareholders at this time we have no commitments from any party to help fund our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital we will be force to shut operations until such capital can be raised or go out of business at this time we cannot say the full costs to bring our proposed product to market or the timing of such commercialization given the nature of our product being in the medical field testing is very expensive and we would need more capital prior to completing the testing phase any refinement or modification of the product after the prototype is developed would also require additional capital at this time we will have to continue to rely on outside capital and a budget that may require adjustment as we move further in the product development phase results of operations for the three months ended march   we had no revenues and expense associated with our operations of  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march   offbalance sheet arrangements the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the company will enter into any offbalance sheet arrangements  forwardlooking statements our company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forwardlooking including statements contained in this quarterly report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our companys stockholders management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters as well as from developments beyond our companys control including changes in global economic conditions are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act these statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made regarding future events and business performance there can be no assurance however that managements expectations will necessarily come to pass factors that may affect forward looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance including the following changes in companywide strategies which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our company is involved or chooses to invest changes in us global or regional economic conditions changes in us and global financial and equity markets including significant interest rate fluctuations which may impede our companys access to or increase the cost of external financing for our operations and investments increased competitive pressures both domestically and internationally legal and regulatory developments such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes labor disputes which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forwardlooking statements is illustrative but by no means exhaustive accordingly all forwardlooking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage americans in this field have the highest rate of divorce by age
