in central austin and it could not have been possible without the help of mark strub and his team at strub residential we started looking at the housing market in austin when my husband was made associate professor at ut austin and we had pretty much a few months to plan and execute our move since we were moving from overseas we talked to as many real estate agents as possible on the phone prior to our first visit to the area for “house hunting” already from our first phone conversation mark strub stood apart from other “highly reviewed agents” in the area such as eric bramlett mark was funny likable and a genuinely good person he was not just “doing business” he took the time to get to know us and our unique preferences before setting us up with our own mls search page for potential listings  as first time homebuyers we had a lot of questions about everything and there was not a single question that mark did not know the answer to he was always available and extremely proactive with all of his communication he also seemed to have a really good handle on listings sending us emails about places that were going to come on the market before they even did and keeping us ahead of the game  when the time came for our three day house hunting trip to austin mark went out of his way to be available anytime we wanted to look at places day or night once we narrowed down our search to a particular community central austin mark not only scheduled for us to see all the available houses in that area but also the schools as this was our top priority as parents of three school aged children when we found our “dream home” mark was incredibly helpful in bargaining with the seller and getting us the price that we were comfortable paying at our closing he was the first one to congratulate us by that time he had became somewhat of a “family friend” he is certainly much more than our “broker” over the past three months we have taken mark’s expert opinion on things ranging from “types of roofing materials” to “what to do in austin with kids on weekends” mark is now helping us renovate our new house using the amazing connections that he has in austin he literally knows anyone and everyone in the real estate market arborists inspectors electricians contractors you name it and mark can get you in contact with themin short mark strub is the best realtor you can ask for he will get you your dream house and not stop until you are  percent happy with everything i would definitely go to mark again for anything related to real estate in austin the roman lopez real estate teampriscilla r rateda year prior to selling our house i started doing my research around the neighborhood at the different agents that were selling the houses in our area i would monitor each house in how long they took to sold how much they sold for and how it was presented to the buyer though i had never met this realtor on paper he looked awesome he was always able to sell the home in days or a couple of weeks the staging of the homes looked great and his clients were always getting asking price when it came time to pick a realtor i went with my gut and chose the roman lopez team this was the right choice for our family we needed to sell our home and buy our new home in a  day span roman lopez and melissa galvan did an awesome job in helping us buy and sell our home melissa and roman were always a call away and were helpful in what ever questions we needed answer roman did an awesome job going to our house and telling us what we needed to do to improve our home to make it more appealing to the buyer though i didnt want to go thru all the work of purging the house painting and improving the look at the house and staging the house roman was spot on on what the buyer would want he was right and it paid off roman and his team made this transaction run smoothly when it came time to pick a buyer roman was always there guiding us with his professional advice melissa was also wonderful in the buying process we met with her to discuss the type of home we wanted and the budget we were looking for we had picked a subdivision that we wanted to live in and while the house that we wanted was not available we found another house for us to live in she was great in giving us advice at what to look for when buying a home she was always an email phone call or text away and she was always informative in answering our questions both roman and melissa were also there for the closing of selling and buying our home they made this process seamless i would definitely recommend this team when you are looking to buy or sell a homecentury  hsk  jeff  wendy mitchler realtorsashley a ratedmy husband and i recently bought our first home with the help of jeff and wendy let me tell you wendy mitchler is knowledgeable personable fantastic at negotiating and all around wonderful jeff is great too he tries to make it to every inspection so that he is able to assist clients in asking the correct questions to the inspector this was so helpfulwe had met with a few realtors by the time we met wendy right away she blew us away while other realtors wanted us to sign with them right away wendy was patient and walked us through the entire process of buying a house including going over the contract so that we would know what to expect as well as know what we were to expect of her she was very clear about her role  which wasnt pushing us into a house we were unsure about she is very adamant about her clients loving their home  not just liking itwe had looked at  houses at the minimum when we made an offer on our new home wendy helped us come up with an offer and helped tweak the contract to benefit us as much as possible we ended up paying k under the apraisal of the house got a k check from the sellers as a painting allowance and got the fridge thrown in as well we wont be in the market for another house anytime soon but if we were there would be no doubt in our minds of who we would use we cant thank jeff and wendy enough for their patience time and genuine caringaustin bee realtydomonique d ratedcalled chris up all i could hear through his deep subdued muffled voice and the telephone static turns out he was eating while on his headset was the address of the apartment we were to meet at and that wed meet in  minutes see you there i said after finishing up riding with a realtor with a personality unappealing to my palette chris was a breath of fresh air thats why i liked him he was at ease in himself at the same time chris was very aware of the changes and apartments in austin i would list a place i saw on craigslist and he would tell me about the real estate agency and aspects of the apartment all the while he gave random facts about austin he told me about the shooting in  from the university tower and how the two police who took down the gunmen argued over who pulled the trigger first hes been at this  years chris breathes this city he showed me several off the path gems in my price range he also really saved me from a challenging situation the apt i signed with  months ago told me my apt wasnt ready  days prior to my move

looking for a home that would fit my needs but more importantly my daughters schooling needs as well he came to my former house and asked me all the important questions that could help him in finding
