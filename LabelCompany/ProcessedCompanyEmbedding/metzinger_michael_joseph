complaint were taken in her role as investigator not in her role as an advocate for the government facts giving rise to this action defendants contacts with plaintiff zieper in early october  plaintiff michael zieper videotaped the short film military takeover of new york city hereinafter military takeover film in times square in new york city in the film an actor purports to be a military officer who is briefing other officers regarding plans for a military takeover of times square on new years eve  the actor never appears in the film but is heard speaking only off camera the visual images in the film consist entirely of street footage of times square during the day the character of the military officer gives instructions to others about how they will participate in the planned takeover the dialogue suggests that to initiate the takeover the military will instigate a race riot by inciting racial unrest among bystanders and by staging a fake attempted rape  the military takeover film is part of a body of work created by zieper which though fictional purports to depict real events ziepers films are part of a genre that also includes for example orson welles war of the worlds and the recent mainstream hollywood movie the blair witch project zieper purposefully avoids the use of framing devices employed in conventional films that signal to the viewer that the events are fictional for example zieper generally does not include credits at the beginning or end of his films he believes that his films challenge viewers to think seriously about difficult social issues the military takeover film raises issues about the upcoming millennium and peoples fears about it the distrust that many americans feel about their government and the use of racial hatred to manipulate the american people  after completing the film zieper decided to make it available for viewing on the web the web is an important venue for independent film makers like zieper who cannot afford the high cost of other types of film distribution and who may be unable to interest mainstream film distributors and festivals in addition zieper believes that the web is a unique and important artistic forum for showing films because the web does not provide the traditional frames that affect the perception and experience of viewers in contexts such as movie theaters and home video rental  zieper contacted plaintiff mark wieger and becamation and arranged to create a web site to show the military takeover film at the address httpcrowdedtheatercom hereinafter crowdedtheatercom becamations web hosting service provided zieper with the computer space for the web site and technical assistance in web design and maintenance including the use of software that allows for showing and viewing video files on the web  the crowdedtheatercom web site was completed and launched on october   the home page of the web site includes a message that states  is there going to be a military takeover of new york city on new years eve  i dont know too much about this tape you are about to see i got it from my cousin steve whos in the army he said that copies of this tape are floating around the base and nobody knows who made it if its fake then theres nothing to worry about if its real then were in really big trouble the web site includes an email address firecrowdedtheatercom for users who want to communicate with the web site owner about the film  zieper posted messages with a link to the crowdedtheatercom on various interactive discussion boards on the internet to generate interest in the film these messages and the film itself prompted discussion about the film on a number of internet discussion boards zieper also received emails at his address firecrowdedtheatercom commenting on the film  on monday november   upn channel  news in new york city contacted zieper to arrange to interview him for a story about the crowdedtheatercom web site and the military takeover film  on wednesday november   the interview was broadcast during the  pm newscast on upn channel  news the interview identified zieper as the creator of the film  prior to the broadcast during the evening of november   zieper and his wife and children were visiting his relatives in another town in new jersey they planned to watch the upn news coverage together around  pm zieper received a call on his pager when he returned the call the phone was answered by a police officer with the caldwell police department the police officer informed zieper that he was standing at the door of ziepers home in west caldwell with agents from the fbi who wanted to speak with zieper about the military takeover film zieper immediately feared that he might be arrested and became concerned about the impact on himself and his family  zieper told the police officer that he would not be home that evening and agreed to call the following day to arrange for a meeting with the fbi agents after hanging up the phone zieper received a second call on his pager from the same number when zieper returned the call the phone was answered by defendant special agent joe metzinger of the fbi metzinger identified himself and explained the reason he wanted to meet with zieper metzinger said that he knew that zieper had a web site that had been receiving a lot of activity metzinger said that the site was causing a lot of concern and that people had asked the fbi what was going on metzinger said that there were a lot of people planning to take vacations and to be in times square for new years and a lot of businesses involved metzinger told zieper that the fbi was trying to find out about the video he asked zieper where he had gotten the video tape  zieper became afraid at that point that the fbi might believe the film to be real and became more fearful that he might be arrested in order to protect himself he decided not to answer any more questions about the film without legal advice zieper asked metzinger whether they could discuss the film the following day and metzinger said yes  metzinger then asked zieper whether in the meantime there was any way the fbi could get people to stop seeing the video on the internet zieper said he didnt think so because upn news was broadcasting a story about the film that evening metzinger then asked whether zieper could call upn and ask them not to run the story zieper said he didnt think he could stop them from running the news story but that he supposed that the fbi could make that call he said he didnt think upn would drop the story if he called himself zieper was then given a phone number to the fbi squad room and told to call at  pm the next day november    after zieper hung up the phone he became very anxious for himself and his family the fbi had indicated that criminal activity was associated with ziepers web site and film zieper currently cares for his children at home during the day while his wife works and he worried about what would happen to his children if he were arrested he feared that the children might be put in protective custody which would be traumatic for them  as a result of the calls from the fbi zieper was afraid to go home to west caldwell with his family and spent the evening at his relatives for fear that the fbi would return to his home and arrest him he did not return home until friday evening november    on thursday november   zieper contacted lawyers for advice regarding the calls from the fbi he did not call the fbi as planned at  pm at  pm zieper received a voice mail message on his pager from metzinger asking why zieper had not called a few minutes later metzinger called ziepers pager again and this time left his phone number zieper did not return the call later in the day attorneys scott thompson and peter skolnik contacted metzinger on ziepers behalf metzinger informed ziepers attorneys that additional fbi agents were currently on their way to ziepers home attorneys thompson and skolnik told metzinger and the fbi to contact them if the agents wished to speak with zieper metzinger said he was not sure he could contact the agents before they reached ziepers home  spokespersons for the justice department defendants were quoted in news articles during the next several days saying that they were involved in an ongoing investigation of zieper in later articles spokespersons for the justice department defendants indicated that the investigation was closed  defendants contacts with plaintiff wieger on or about monday november  plaintiff mark wieger received a conference phone call from defendant special agent metzinger and defendant assistant united states attorney lisa korologos they asked whether he was the owner of crowdedtheatercom wieger told them he was not the owner but just provided web hosting services for the site metzinger and korologos described the crowdedtheatercom web site saying that it contained a grainy video about a supposed military takeover of times square on new years eve they told wieger that they had received calls from people asking if the film were real or not quoting some of the dialogue from the film they said they were concerned that the tape could start a race riot because it contained racial slurs and a suggestion of rape in fact the film contains no racial slurs they told wieger that it was their job to make sure that a riot did not occur and to ensure that people would not go to times square thinking that a riot would occur they said that they did not want people showing up in times square on new years eve with guns and knives watching for any military people or police to make a wrong move  metzinger and korologos explained to wieger that they had traced the crowdedtheatercom web site to him through gte an internet service provider and back to online marketing llc olm which is the business with whom wieger contracts to lease the computer space on the internet for his clients metzinger and korologos said they had contacted olm and had left a message asking them to take down the site if wieger did not take it down  at that point wieger became afraid that olm would cancel their account with him as a result of pressure from the fbi which would devastate plaintiff becamation because all of becamations clients rely on the leased computer space provided through olm  wieger asked metzinger and korologos what they wanted from him the agents replied that they wanted to know how they could stop people from seeing the video wieger asked whether they wanted him to block access to the video and they said yes  wieger then asked metzinger and korologos if they knew who owned the site and they said yes metzinger and korologos told wieger that they had been in contact with zieper and his lawyers they told wieger that they had asked zieper to take down the site but that zieper had refused  wieger asked metzinger and korologos whether he should contact zieper and they said no metzinger and korologos told wieger that if zieper called him wieger should tell zieper to contact them wieger asked for their phone numbers which they gave him  as a result of the call from metzinger and korologos wieger was afraid for himself his business and his family he had no lawyer to call for advice and could not afford one  while metzinger and korologos were still on the phone wieger pulled up the crowdedtheatercom web site on his computer and removed the link on the front page of the site to the file containing the military takeover film he also put a message on the home page of the site saying the site was disabled he told metzinger and korologos that he had disabled the link to the military takeover film on the site and they thanked him  wieger phoned his fiancée who reacted with
