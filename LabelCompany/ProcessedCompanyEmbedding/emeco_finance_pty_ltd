services guide fsg for more information mining equipment rental business emeco holdings limited asx ehl has finally given shareholders something to cheer about with shares in the embattled company jumping to a twomonth high this morning emeco announced it would buy one of australia’s largest road haulage truck and trailer rental businesses in a deal that would add about  million to emeco’s earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda on a full year basis that’s a substantial boost to earnings given that emeco’s first half operating ebitda came in at  million the market liked the news with the stock surging  or  cents to  cents but the expected lift in profit isn’t the only reason to get investors excited the deal to buy rentco appears to represent a viable way for emeco to diversify away from the mining industry demand for equipment has fallen as miners have cut back on capital spending in the wake of the commodities slump rentco owns around  trucks trailers and ancillary equipment around australia and is seen as a market leader with an average equipment utilisation rate of  over the past threeandahalf years demand for road freight tends to track gross domestic product gdp and not investment cycles which should lend greater stability to emeco’s business the deal also appears to be priced relatively attractively emeco will pay  million for the business with a potential earnout of up to  million if certain ebitda targets are achieved this would put the deal on a  times enterprisevalue to ebitda multiple the acquisition will be funded from emeco’s cash reserves and from profits generated by rentco the transaction will put the focus on crane hire company boom logistics limited asx bol as the company is also being heavily weighed down by the mining sector i am expecting to see analysts upgrade their earnings projections for emeco on the back of this deal and i suspect emeco could enjoy a rerating after the stock slumped over  in the past  months nonetheless emeco remains suited only for those with a strong stomach for risk as i expect the stock to remain volatile hot off the presses the motley fools top stock for  is a sexy asx
