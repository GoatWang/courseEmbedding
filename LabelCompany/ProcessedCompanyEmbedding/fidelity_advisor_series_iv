participating advisors would consider merging with another firm fewer  just  percent of the participating firms  were interested in selling their firms “while many rias are interested in ma the pace of deals has not been commensurate with the interest we’ve seen from advisors” said david canter executive vice president and head of practice management and consulting at fidelity institutional wealth services “we believe that is largely due to the lack of organizational focus tools and thirdparty support needed to facilitate ma  so we’ve designed a program that combines those factors with the financing needed to implement a deal” through a strategic alliance with live oak bank fidelity is providing its ria clients access to discounted pricing on loans and a dedicated servicing team that can help streamline the loan acceptance processii live oak bank is a small business lender and can provide financing to certain advisors for loans up to  million in addition to providing loans

too good to pass up – a white paper that offers examples of two advisory firms that were acquired it addresses when firms should start thinking about liquidity options whether advisors should consider entertaining offers if they weren’t planning to sell and how they can determine the right buyer for their business “we believe that to be highperforming a firm needs to continually reevaluate its existing business model against its goals to stay competitiveiv this offering was built to address the understanding that many highperforming firms evolve and are looking to build their businesses

funds fmr co and sai are investment advisers registered under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any investment adviser to the funds will be registered under the advisers act  the prior order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their shortterm balances the prior order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the ifl program the “ifl rate” be based on the average of a the higher of the overnight time deposit rate the “otd rate” and the funds current overnight repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the ifl rate to be charged to the funds under the ifl program will be the average of a the ficash rate and b the benchmark rate  on each business day the cash management services department “cash management department” of fidelity service company inc will

agreement at least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any fund borrows through the ifl program prior to such borrowing the cash management department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the ifl rate is more favorable to the lending fund than the ficash rate and more favorable to the borrowing fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate  if a fund has outstanding borrowings any interfund loans to the fund i will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan ii will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral iii will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and iv will provide that if an event of default by the fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund that event of default will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund loan agreement entitling the lending fund to call the loan and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund  a fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the ifl program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total  or less of its total assets provided that if the fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another fund the funds interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral if a funds total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow through the ifl program only on a secured basis a fund could not borrow through the ifl program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than  of its total assets  before any fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may through additional borrowings cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed  of its total assets the fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan if the total outstanding borrowings of a fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed  of its total assets for any other reason such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions the fund will within one business day thereafter i repay all its outstanding interfund loans ii reduce its outstanding indebtedness to  or less of its total assets or iii secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a funds total outstanding borrowings exceed  is repaid or the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets the fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan  no fund may lend to another fund through the ifl program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the ifl program to exceed  of the lending funds current net assets at the time of the loan  a funds interfund loans to any one fund shall not exceed  of the lending funds net assets  the duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold but in no event more than seven days loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition  each interfund loan may be called on one business days notice by a lending fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund  a funds participation in the ifl program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents no fund may borrow through the ifl program unless the fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that certain funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose  the cash management department will calculate total fund borrowing and lending demand through the ifl program and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the funds without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the funds the cash management department will not solicit cash for the ifl program from any fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in ficash or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by fmr co or another fmr entity or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the funds  fmr will monitor the ifl rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the fund boards concerning the

not work as intended the fund may not achieve its objective description of principal security types debt securities are used by issuers to borrow money the issuer usually pays a fixed variable or floating rate of interest and must repay the amount borrowed at the maturity of the security some debt securities such as zero coupon bonds do not pay current interest but are sold at a discount from

mortgage and other assetbacked securities prospectus fund basics  continued ra rrepurchase agreement is an agreement to buy a security at one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreedupon price principal investment risks many factors affect the funds performance the funds yield and share price change daily based on changes in interest rates and market conditions and in response to other economic political or financial developments the funds reaction to these developments will be affected by the types and maturities of securities in which the fund invests the financial condition industry and economic sector and geographic location of an issuer and the funds level of investment in the securities of that issuer it is important to note that neither the funds share price nor its yield is guaranteed by the us government when you sell your shares of the fund they could be worth more or less than what you paid for them the following factors can significantly affect the funds performance interest rate changes debt securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates in general the price of a debt security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall securities with longer maturities and mortgage securities can be more sensitive to interest rate changes in other words the longer the maturity of a security the greater the impact a change in interest rates could have on the securitys price in addition shortterm and longterm interest rates do not necessarily move in the same amount or the same direction shortterm securities tend to react to changes in shortterm interest rates and longterm securities tend to react to changes in longterm interest rates prepayment many types of debt securities including mortgage securities are subject to prepayment risk prepayment occurs when the issuer of a security can repay principal prior to the securitys maturity securities subject to prepayment can offer less potential for gains during a declining interest rate environment and similar or greater potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment in addition the potential impact of prepayment features on the price of a debt security can be difficult to predict and result in greater volatility issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an issuers securities in

may be considered an underwriter within the meaning of the securities act of  in the disposition of restricted securities  purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal

investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in the real estate business  purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments but this shall not prevent the fund from purchasing or selling options and futures contracts or from investing in securities or other instruments backed by

securities or to repurchase agreements  the fund may notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy or limitation invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations as the fund the following investment limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval i the fund does not currently intend to sell securities short unless it owns or has the right to obtain securities at no additional cost other than ancillary transaction and settlement costs equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short and provided that transactions in futures contracts and options are not deemed to constitute selling securities short ii the fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin except that the fund may obtain such shortterm credits as are necessary for the clearance of transactions and provided that margin payments in connection with futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall not constitute purchasing securities on margin iii the fund may borrow money only a from a bank or from a registered investment company or portfolio for which fmr or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or b by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with any party reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings for purposes of fundamental investment limitation  iv the fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if as a result more than  of its net assets would be invested in securities that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued v the fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than securities to other parties except by a lending money up to  of the funds net assets to a registered investment company or portfolio for which fmr or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or b acquiring loans loan participations or other forms of direct debt instruments and in

currently intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations as the fund with respect to limitation iv if through a change in values net assets or other circumstances the fund were in a position where more than  of its net assets were invested in illiquid securities it would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity for the funds limitations on futures and options transactions see the section entitled limitations on futures and options transactions on page click here  rthe fund has been advised that the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec does not consider proprietary strips of securities issued by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities and privately sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations cmos backed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities to be us government securities

instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  custodian banks for cmos that are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  custodian banks for cmos that are backed by us government agencies and instrumentalities but not by the full faith and credit of the us government if the fund concludes that under applicable legal principles any of these

invest strategies fidelity management  research company fmr may employ in pursuit of the funds investment objective and a summary of related risks fmr may not buy all of these instruments or use all of these techniques unless it believes that doing so will help the fund achieve its goal affiliated bank transactions a fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are or may be considered to be affiliated persons of the fund under the  act these transactions may involve repurchase agreements with custodian banks shortterm obligations of and repurchase agreements with the  largest us banks measured by deposits municipal securities us government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers in these securities shortterm currency transactions and shortterm borrowings in accordance with exemptive orders issued by the sec the board of trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions borrowing the fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by fmr or its affiliates or through reverse repurchase agreements if the fund borrows money its share price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off if the fund makes additional investments while borrowings are outstanding this may be considered a form of leverage cash management a fund can hold uninvested cash or can invest it in cash equivalents such as money market securities repurchase agreementsrr or shares of money market ror shortterm bond fundsr generally these securities offer less potential for gains than other types of securities central funds are money market ror shortterm bondr funds managed by fmr or its affiliatesr the money market central funds rseek to earn a high level of current income free from federal income tax in the case of a municipal money market fund while maintaining a stable  share price the rmoney market central rfunds comply with industrystandard requirements for money market funds regarding the quality maturity and diversification of their investments the shortterm bond central funds seek to obtain a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital dollarweighted average maturity is derived by multiplying the value of each investment by the time remaining to its maturity adding these calculations and then dividing the total by the value of the funds portfolio an obligations maturity is typically determined on a stated final maturity basis although there are some exceptions to this rule for example if it is probable that the issuer of an instrument will take advantage of a maturityshortening device such as a call refunding or redemption provision the date on which the instrument will probably be called refunded or redeemed may be considered to be its maturity date also the maturities of mortgage securities including collateralized mortgage obligations and some assetbacked securities are determined on a weighted average life basis which is the average time for principal to be repaid for a mortgage security this average time is calculated by estimating the timing of principal payments including unscheduled prepayments during the life of the mortgage the weighted average life of these securities is likely to be substantially shorter than their stated final maturity futures and options the following paragraphs pertain to futures and options combined positions correlation of price changes futures contracts futures margin payments limitations on futures and options transactions liquidity of options and futures contracts otc options purchasing put and call options and writing put and call options combined positions involve purchasing and writing options in combination with each other or in combination with futures or forward contracts to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position for example purchasing a put option and writing a call option on the same underlying instrument would construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial price increase because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out correlation of price changes because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded options and futures contracts it is likely that the standardized contracts available will not match a funds current or anticipated investments exactly a fund may invest in options and futures contracts based on securities with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically invests which involves a risk that the options or futures position will not track the performance of the funds other investments options and futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments even if the underlying instruments match a funds investments well options and futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated shortterm interest rates changes in volatility of the underlying instrument and the time remaining until expiration of the contract which may not affect security prices the same way imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets from structural differences in how options and futures and securities are traded or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts a fund may purchase or sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities although this may not be successful in all cases if price changes in a funds options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments futures contracts in purchasing a futures contract the buyer agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date in selling a futures contract the seller agrees to sell a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date the price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when the buyer and seller enter into the contract some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities such as us treasury bonds or notes and some are based on indices of securities prices futures can be held until their delivery dates or can be closed out before then if a liquid secondary market is available the value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument therefore purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase a funds exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly when a fund sells a futures contract by contrast the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the market selling futures contracts therefore will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes much as if the underlying instrument had been sold futures margin payments the purchaser or seller of a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date however both the purchaser and seller are required to deposit initial margin with a futures broker known as a futures commission merchant fcm when the contract is entered into initial margin deposits are typically equal to a percentage of the contracts value if the value of either partys position declines that party will be required to make additional variation margin payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis the party that has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin for purposes of a funds investment limitations in the event of the bankruptcy of an fcm that holds margin on behalf of a fund the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the fcms other customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund limitations on futures and options transactions the fund has filed a notice of eligibility for exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator with the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the national futures association which regulate trading in the futures markets the fund intends to comply with rule  under the commodity exchange act which limits the extent to which the fund can commit assets to initial margin deposits and option premiums in addition the fund will not a sell futures contracts purchase put options or write call options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions b purchase futures contracts or write put options if as a result the funds total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed  of its total assets or c purchase call options if as a result the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed  of the funds total assets these limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities and do not apply to securities that incorporate features similar to options the fund further limits its options and futures investments to options and futures contracts relating to us government securities the above limitations on the funds investments in futures contracts and options and the funds policies regarding futures contracts and options discussed elsewhere in this sai may be changed as regulatory agencies permit liquidity of options and futures contracts there is no assurance a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular options or futures contract at any particular time options may have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying instruments current price in addition exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts and may halt trading if a contracts price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the secondary market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result a funds access to other assets held to cover its options or futures positions could also be impaired otc options unlike exchangetraded options which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument expiration date contract size and strike price the terms of overthecounter otc options options not traded on exchanges generally are established through negotiation with the other party to the option contract while this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater flexibility to tailor an option to its needs otc options generally involve greater credit risk than exchangetraded options which are guaranteed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are traded purchasing put and call options by purchasing a put option the purchaser obtains the right but not the obligation to sell the options underlying instrument at a fixed strike price in return for this right the purchaser pays the current market price for the option known as the option premium options have various types of underlying instruments including specific securities indices of securities prices and futures contracts the purchaser may terminate its position in a put option by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option if the option is allowed to expire the purchaser will lose the entire premium if the option is exercised the purchaser completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price a purchaser may also terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price if a liquid secondary market exists the buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially however if the underlying instruments price does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss limited to the amount of the premium plus related transaction costs the features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase rather than sell the underlying instrument at the options strike price a call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall at the same time the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option writing put and call options the writer of a put or call option takes the opposite side of the transaction from the options purchaser in return for receipt of the premium the writer assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the options underlying instrument if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it the writer may seek to terminate a position in a put option before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary market at its current price if the secondary market is not liquid for a put option however the writer must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding regardless of price changes when writing an option on a futures contract a fund will be required to make margin payments to an fcm as described above for futures contracts if security prices rise a put writer would generally expect to profit although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received if security prices remain the same over time it is likely that the writer will also profit because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price if security prices fall the put writer would expect to suffer a loss this loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument directly however because the premium received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline writing a call option obligates the writer to sell or deliver the options underlying instrument in return for the strike price upon exercise of the option the characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall through receipt of the option premium a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline at the same time because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price even if its current value is greater a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security price increases illiquid securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund under the supervision of the board of trustees fmr determines the liquidity of a funds investments and through reports from fmr the board monitors investments in illiquid securities in determining the liquidity of a funds investments fmr may consider various factors including  the frequency and volume of trades and quotations  the number of dealers and prospective purchasers in the marketplace  dealer undertakings to make a market and r rthe nature of the security and the market in which it trades including any demand put or tender features the mechanics and other requirements for transfer any letters of credit or other credit enhancement features any ratings the number of holders the method of soliciting offers the time required to dispose of the security and the ability to assign or offset the rights and obligations of the security indexed securities are instruments whose prices are indexed to the prices of other securities securities indices or other financial indicators indexed securities typically but not always are debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a specific instrument or statistic mortgageindexed securities for example could be structured to replicate the performance of mortgage securities and the characteristics of direct ownership the performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security or other instrument to which they are indexed and may also be influenced by interest rate changes indexed securities may be more volatile than the underlying instruments indexed securities are also subject to the credit risks associated with the issuer of the security and their values may decline substantially if the issuers creditworthiness deteriorates recent issuers of indexed securities have included banks corporations and certain us government agencies interfund borrowing and lending program pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the sec a fund may lend money to and borrow money from other funds advised by fmr or its affiliates a fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the costs of bank loans and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs investmentgrade debt securities investmentgrade debt securities rinclude all types of debt instruments that are of rmedium and rhighquality some may possess speculative characteristics and may be more sensitive to economic changes and to changes in the financial conditions of issuers a debt security is considered to be investmentgrade if it is rated investmentgrade by moodys investors service standard  poors m®® rsp ® r or fitch inc or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by fmr mortgage securities are issued by government and nongovernment entities such as banks mortgage lenders or other institutions a mortgage security is an obligation of the issuer backed by a mortgage or pool of mortgages or a direct interest in an underlying pool of mortgages some mortgage securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations or cmos make payments of both principal and interest at a range of specified intervals others make semiannual interest payments at a predetermined rate and repay principal at maturity like a typical bond mortgage securities are based on different types of mortgages including those on commercial real estate or residential properties stripped mortgage securities are created when the interest and principal components of a mortgage security are separated and sold as individual securities in the case of a stripped mortgage security the holder of the principalonly security po receives the principal payments made by the underlying mortgage while the holder of the interestonly security io receives interest payments from the same underlying mortgage fannie maes and freddie macs are passthrough securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac respectively fannie mae and freddie mac which guarantee payment of interest and repayment of principal on fannie maes and freddie macs respectively are federally chartered corporations supervised by the us government that act as governmental instrumentalities under authority granted by congress fannie mae is authorized to borrow from the us treasury to meet its obligations fannie maes and freddie macs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the value of mortgage securities may change due to shifts in the markets perception of issuers and changes in interest rates in addition regulatory or tax changes may adversely affect the mortgage securities market as a whole nongovernment mortgage securities may offer higher yields than those issued by government entities but also may be subject to greater price changes than government issues mortgage securities are subject to prepayment risk which is the risk that early principal payments made on the underlying mortgages usually in response to a reduction in interest rates will result in the return of principal to the investor causing it to be invested subsequently at a lower current interest rate alternatively in a rising interest rate environment mortgage security values may be adversely affected when prepayments on underlying mortgages do not occur as anticipated resulting in the extension of the securitys effective maturity and the related increase in interest rate sensitivity of a longerterm instrument the prices of stripped mortgage securities tend to be more volatile in response to changes in interest rates than those of nonstripped mortgage securities to earn additional income for a fund fmr may use a trading strategy that involves selling mortgage securities and simultaneously agreeing to purchase similar securities on a later date at a set price this trading strategy may rincrease interest rate exposure andr result in an increased portfolio turnover rate which increases costs and may increase taxable gains repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security as protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation the securities are held in a separate account at a bank markedtomarket daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount the value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security in addition delays or losses could result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a funds yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage securities lending a fund may lend securities to parties such as brokerdealers or other institutions including fidelity brokerage services llc fbs llc fbs llc is a member of the new york stock exchange nyse and an indirect subsidiary of fmr corp securities lending allows a fund to retain ownership of the securities loaned and at the same time earn additional income the borrower provides the fund with collateral in an amount at least equal to the value of the securities loaned the fund maintains the ability to obtain the right to vote or consent on proxy proposals involving material events affecting securities loaned if the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral if a fund is not able to recover the securities loaned a fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market the value of the collateral could decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased loans will be made only to parties deemed by fmr to be in good standing and when in fmrs judgment the income earned would justify the risks cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities including shares of a money market fund investing this cash subjects that investment as well as the securities loaned to market appreciation or depreciation stripped securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security the risks associated with stripped securities are similar to those of other debt securities although stripped securities may be more volatile and the value of certain types of stripped securities may move in the same direction as interest rates us treasury securities that have been stripped by a federal reserve bank are obligations issued by the us treasury privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a us treasury security or other us government security with a custodian for safekeeping the custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment which the dealer then sells swap agreements can be individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types of investments or market factors depending on their structure swap agreements may increase or decrease a funds exposure to long or shortterm interest rates mortgage securities corporate borrowing rates or other factors such as security prices or inflation rates swap agreements can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names in a typical cap or floor agreement one party agrees to make payments only under specified circumstances usually in return for payment of a fee by the other party for example the buyer of an interest rate cap obtains the right to receive payments to the extent that a specified interest rate exceeds an agreedupon level while the seller of an interest rate floor is obligated to make payments to the extent that a specified interest rate falls below an agreedupon level an interest rate collar combines elements of buying a cap and selling a floor swap agreements will tend to shift a funds investment exposure from one type of investment to another for example if the fund agreed to pay fixed rates in exchange for floating rates while holding fixedrate bonds the swap would tend to decrease the funds exposure to longterm interest rates caps and floors have an effect similar to buying or writing options depending on how they are used swap agreements may increase or decrease the overall volatility of a funds investments and its share price and yield the most significant factor in the performance of swap agreements is the change in the specific interest rate or other factors that determine the amounts of payments due to and from a fund if a swap agreement calls for payments by the fund the fund must be prepared to make such payments when due in addition if the counterpartys creditworthiness declined the value of a swap agreement would be likely to decline potentially resulting in losses a fund may be able to eliminate its exposure under a swap agreement either by assignment or other disposition or by entering into an offsetting swap agreement with the same party or a similarly creditworthy party temporary defensive policies the fund reserves the right to invest without limitation in investmentgrade money market or shortterm debt instruments for temporary defensive purposes variable and floating rate securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security variable rate securities provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate ror the issuers credit qualityr some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries whenissued and forward purchase or sale transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security typically no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered when purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership including the risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated because payment for the securities is not required until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a funds investments if a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding the purchases may result in a form of leverage when a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security if the other party to a delayeddelivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss a fund may renegotiate a whenissued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery which may result in capital gains or losses for the fund zero coupon bonds do not make interest payments instead they are sold at a discount from their face value and are redeemed at face value when they mature because zero coupon bonds do not pay current income their prices can be more volatile than other types of fixedincome securities when interest rates change in calculating a funds dividend a portion of the difference between a zero coupon bonds purchase price and its face value is considered income portfolio transactions rall orders for the purchase or sale

fund from directly or indirectly benefiting an fmr affiliate in connection with such underwritings in addition for underwritings where an fmr affiliate participates as a principal underwriter certain restrictions may apply that could among other things limit the amount of securities that the fund could purchase in the underwritings from time to time the trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the fund of some portion of the brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the fund on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable the fund seeks to recapture soliciting brokerdealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect the trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and if so to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for the fund to seek such recapture although the

procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable for each fund in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the fund to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the fund it is the current opinion of the trustees that the desirability of retaining fmr as investment adviser to the fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions valuation the funds net asset value per share nav is the value of a single share the nav of the fund is computed by adding the value of the funds investments cash and other assets subtracting its liabilities and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding portfolio securities are valued by various methods depending on the primary market or exchange on which they trade rdebt rsecurities and other assets for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at market values determined by such securities most recent bid prices sales prices if the principal market is an exchange in the principal market in which they normally are traded as furnished by recognized dealers in such securities or assets or rdebtr securities may be valued on the basis of information furnished by a pricing service that uses a valuation matrix which incorporates both dealersupplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques use of pricing services has been approved by the board of trustees a number of pricing services are available and the fund may use various pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service futures contracts and options are valued on the basis of market quotations if available securities of other openend investment companies are valued at their respective navs shortterm securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which market quotations and information furnished by a pricing service are not readily available are valued either at amortized cost or at original cost plus accrued interest both of which approximate current value the procedures set forth above need not be used to determine the value of the securities owned by the fund if in the opinion of a committee appointed by the board of trustees some other method would more accurately reflect the fair value of such securities for example securities and other assets for which there is no readily available market value may be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the board of trustees in making a good faith determination of the value of a security the committee may review price movements in futures contracts and american depositary receipts adrs market and trading trends the bidask quotes of brokers and offexchange institutional trading performance the fund may quote performance in various ways all performance information supplied by the fund in advertising is historical and is not intended to indicate future returns the funds share price yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors and the value of fund shares when redeemed may be more or less than their original cost yield calculations yields for the fund are computed by dividing the funds interest and income for a given day or onemonth period net of expenses by the average number of shares entitled to receive distributions during the period dividing this figure by the funds nav at the end of the period and annualizing the result assuming compounding of income in order to arrive at an annual percentage rate income is calculated for purposes of yield quotations in accordance with standardized methods applicable to all stock and bond funds in general interest income is reduced with respect to bonds trading at a premium over their par value by subtracting a portion of the premium from income on a daily basis and is increased with respect to bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion of the discount to daily income income is adjusted to reflect gains and losses from principal repayments received by a fund with respect to mortgagerelated securities and other assetbacked securities other capital gains and losses generally are excluded from the calculation income calculated for the purposes of calculating the funds yield differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes because of the different accounting methods used and because of the compounding of income assumed in yield calculations the funds yield may not equal its distribution rate the income paid to an investors account or the income reported in the funds financial statements yield information may be useful in reviewing the funds performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives however the funds yield fluctuates unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time when comparing investment alternatives investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to consider investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates the funds yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates and in periods of rising interest rates the funds yield will tend to be somewhat lower also when interest rates are falling the inflow of net new money to the fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the funds holdings thereby reducing the funds current yield in periods of rising interest rates the opposite can be expected to occur return calculations returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of the funds return including the effect of reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions and any change in the funds nav over a stated period a cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period of time average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in the fund over a stated period and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period for example a cumulative return of  over ten years would produce an average annual return of  which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal  growth on a compounded basis in ten years while average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives investors should realize that the funds performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual yeartoyear performance of the fund in addition to average annual returns the fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments or a series of redemptions over any time period returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return returns may be quoted on a beforetax or aftertax basis aftertax returns reflect the return of a hypothetical rinvestmentr after payment

quoted numerically or in a table graph or similar illustration net asset value charts and graphs using the funds navs adjusted navs and benchmark indexes may be used to exhibit performance an adjusted

performance of particular types of mutual funds these comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by lipper inc lipper an independent service located in summit new jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds generally lipper rankings are based on return assume reinvestment of distributions do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration and are prepared without regard to tax consequences lipper may also rank based on yield in addition to the mutual fund rankings the funds performance may be compared to stock bond and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by lipper or other organizations when comparing these indexes it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment for example while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility likewise money market funds may offer greater stability of principal but generally do not offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds from time to time the funds performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals for example the fund may quote morningstar inc in its advertising materials morningstar inc is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of riskadjusted performance rankings that compare the performance of fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising the fund may

fixed dollar amount in a fund at periodic intervals thereby purchasing fewer shares when prices are high and more shares when prices are low while such a strategy does not assure a profit or guard against loss in a declining market the investors average cost per share can be lower than if fixed numbers of shares are purchased at the same intervals in evaluating such a plan investors should

trust on may   currently there are two funds in the trust fidelity institutional shortintermediate government fund and fidelity real estate high income fund  the trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust and to create additional classes of the fund the assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income earnings profits and proceeds

commonly known as a massachusetts business trust under massachusetts law shareholders of such a trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust the declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the trust or fund the declaration of trust provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets the declaration of trust further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason the declaration of trust also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which a fund itself

percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of

average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other
