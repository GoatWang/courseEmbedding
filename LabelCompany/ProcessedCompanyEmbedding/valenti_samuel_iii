version finance sam valenti iii ive been at crains for nearly seven years now the most memorable person ive met on the job here hands down its sam valenti iii who was profiled in mondays print edition as the winner of the lifetime achievement award for the upcoming annual crains ma awards ive been covering venture capital since the late s when i was a freelancer and realized vc was a niche no one else in town was writing about and might be a source of recurring income when crains offered me the finance beat in  i took it with the intention of doing more with vc than crains had traditionally done the timing was perfect — the economy was booming more vc firms were opening their doors and the state through the  million st century fund and the  million michigan venture fund was about to make a lot more money available for local funds to invest with late  early  i was on the phone with lindsay aspegren a friend and old source at north coast technology investors lp in ann arbor he mentioned someone named sam valenti whos sam valenti i asked how can you cover venture capital in this town and not know sam valenti he said i dont know who is he sam valenti is the godfather of venture capital here said aspegren im going to give you his cell and you call him and go meet him ill call him first and tell him i told you to call him give me five minutes and then call him yes sir five minutes later i called sam he was he said quietly an old sicilian been at this a long time had a little shop in blooomfield hills ran some money for old family friends had avoided publicity over the years but was at a point in his life where he wouldnt mind saying what was on his mind so come on out we agreed on a time and more out of loyalty to lindsay than anything else i drove out not that i didnt mind an excuse to get out of the office or the chance to add another source to the rolodex but i wasnt expecting much valenti had planted a vision in my mind of a small wizened old sicilian maybe a financial stud back in the day but past his prime a little office managing a few bucks for old friends who were happy to throw him a bone in his dotage so i drove out woodward to bloomfield hills pulled into the parking lot of a large office building walked in the front door and saw an office off the lobby that proclaimed valenti capital i walked in and was struck by the mahogany the artwork the sense of real money the receptionist made a call to sam who told her to send me back she pointed out the hallway to the right and told me to head down it lindsay aspegren it was a hall that seemed to stretch to infinity on the way down i walked past some stadium seating on the left — some  seats now empty aimed at a bank of tv screens to the right now off i looked back at the end of the hall just as sam walked out of his office at the far end and started striding toward me little wizened has anyone ever had a worse misconception valenti is about  looks like a million bucks in his tailored suit and crisp white shirt walks with his shoulders back and head erect with a cockofthewalk stride was in his early s then looked  years younger maybe youve heard of my son he said that being sam valenti iv i had hed been one of our s in their s and unlike his father showed up frequently in our electronic archives his dad had rarely appeared even though hed been head of the investment committee for the state of michigan pension fund for many years and had been president of masco capital the pension and investment arm of masco corp i would find out over time mostly from others that sam had singlehandedly created the concept of venture capital and private equity as an investment class for institutional investors in michigan with money from masco and often matching money from the state pension fund the states vc and private equity communities were born and grew everyone was rewarded masco made money the vc and pe firms made money and the states pension fund grew from about  billion to about  billion on valentis watch hed decided to meet with me he explained because he figured he was at a point in his life where he wouldnt mind commenting on the issues of the day or serving as a source until now he said he figured his job was serving masco and richard manoogian its president and ceo and had scrupulously avoided the press and hes been a good source ever since he tipped me to the renaissance venture capital fund he was trying to raise hes helped clarify and put into context various issues of the day and hes explained the various ups and downs of the market over the years in the dark days of the recession when a great depression seemed to be looming my young multimedia colleague nate skid and i went and sat at sams knee for an hour while he gave a history lesson on how the economy had got to that point without notes and without pause speaking in complete sentences and paragraphs and with none of the verbal ticks most of us need sam wove in various threads from around the world the last three decades and tied them into a bow nate posted the entire lecture a tour de force on our web site i pulled out excerpts for the print edition it was a remarkable tour de force and proof not that any was needed of sams intellect raj kothari a managing director at birminghambased seneca partners a vc firm and investment bank worked for masco capital for six years he called after reading the story on sams lifetimeachievement award to pass on some thoughts sam is a great guy to work for i had so much fun and learned so much i was doing things at  i never should have been entrusted with he really is a great guy and a legendary character he said gerry boylan managing director at royal oakbased long point capital a private equity company passed on some thoughts in an email great choice on sam valenti for your upcoming awards hes one of the most interesting people ive ever worked with or for that matter ever met the ma awards in conjunction with the local chapter of the association for corporate growth are on april  at the somerset inn in troy valenti who prides himself on his public speaking says hes planning on bringing down the house with
