indrani and good morning everyone in case you havent yet had the pleasure to meet her indrani recently assumed the fairmount santrol ir leadership role from sharon van zeeland michael and i would personally like to thank sharon for the critical role she played in building our investor relations function over the past several years indranis background is in finance and she has worked closely

confident that indrani will do a great job in her new role and we will all appreciate working directly with both her and matt schlarb with that thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in fairmount santrol ill begin this mornings call with a highlevel overview of our first quarter performance and the more color on demand within both of our  segments and then michael will cover the financials in greater detail ill conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook for the second quarter along with some perspectives on market conditions and a few other key focus areas for fairmount santrol following my comments well be happy to answer your questions were pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter total company volumes and sales were in line with the outlook we shared in midmarch with profitability that was moderately higher than our outlook due mainly to strong sales of valueadded products in march continued improvement in our proppant solutions segment coupled with continued solid results of our ir segment led to total company volumes of  million tons or  sequential growth this overall volume growth combined with stronger frac sand pricing and a higher percentage of sales within our valueadded product lines contributed to revenues of  million or a  sequential growth accordingly our profitability improved during the quarter with adjusted ebitda totaling  million as improved pricing and fixed cost leverage further contributed to improved profit level moving to our segment performance lets begin with the results from our proppant solutions business demand was up across our full product portfolio total proppant solutions volumes were  million tons up  over the prior quarter overall demand for frac sand remains strong with most grades of frac sand sold out during the first quarter frac sand volume of  million tons were up  sequentially driven largely by additional demand for coarser grade as capacity constraints for finer grades persisted and as inherent well design helped to fuel growth in our coarsergrade products higher proppant production at our menomonie facility along with limited production during the rampup of our brewer and maiden rock facilities also allowed us to increase our effective capacity during the first quarter and contributed modestly to our volume growth valueadded proppants had a very strong quarter with volumes totaling  tons a  increase over fourth quarter volume of  tons with strength in both resincoated proppant and propel ssp historically our resincoated volumes are highly correlated to rig count changes often with a few months lag thus far this trend has held true although we believe that some of the increase resin demand we saw in the first quarter was also covering a pentup demand from the fourth quarter during which time our customers faced yearend budget constraints as well as other seasonal factors weve seen a particularly strong increasing demand for our curable resincoated products we attribute some of this growth to an increased interest in preventing proppant flowback in the well in order to keep completions equipment running more efficiently which is increasingly important as availability of equipment and crude has become tighter sequential ssp growth was also high in addition to the inherent gains in well productivity when using propel both pumping time and water usage is typically reduced by  of that which is needed to play similar proppant volume within a slickwater well design again addressing equipment and crew efficiencies pricing also improved as expected during the quarter with raw frac sand prices increasing by over  per ton on average we expect fob mine volume to make up a slightly higher percentage of overall volume in the coming quarters as we rampup operations at our brewer and maiden rock facilities which will likely have a higher mix of fob mine sales based on customer preferences and commitments turning to our ir segment total volumes were  tons up  over both the prior quarter and the first quarter of  demand was solid across all product lines with particular strength in our valueadded products we were pleased that these relatively flat overall tons were leveraged for nice uplift in profitability we expect solid performance from our ir segment to continue in the second quarter with that ill turn it over to michael to cover the financials in more detail michael biehl thanks jenniffer and good morning everyone ill focus on – primarily on sequential comparisons over the fourth quarter of  which we believe were more relevant given the current market dynamics and trends from one quarter to the next as jenniffer mentioned total company revenues for the quarter were  million in line with our outlook we have provided and up  sequentially proppant solutions revenues were  million for the first quarter of  up  compared to the fourth quarter improved pricing as jenniffer noted and higher volumes particularly in our coated proppants were the main contributors to revenue growth remained capacity constraint across most grades especially in finer grades industrial and recreational revenue was  million for the first quarter  up  compared to fourth quarter of  and up  versus the first quarter of  the increase in revenues was due in part for price increases instituted at the beginning of the year as well as an increase in our valueadded product sales particularly in our recreation and building product lines the companys consolidated gross profit was  million in the first quarter or  of sales up from  million or  of sales in the fourth quarter gross profit for the proppant solutions segment was  million in the first quarter or roughly  per ton compared with  million in the fourth quarter or  per ton the sequential gross profit improvement in the proppant solutions business is largely attributed to volume growth in both raw and coated proppants and pricing improvements offset somewhat by higher rail rates normal seasonal factors due to colder weather and cost associated with restart of our brewer and maiden rock facilities as brewer and maiden rock increased their production our average manufacturing cost per ton will increase moderately however improved fixed cost leverage and lower excess railcar cost will help to offset this increase in production cost so expect cost per ton to remain relatively flat to up slightly in the second quarter our improved cost position from higher volumes and lower excess railcar cost will offset higher production costs from reactivated plants including startup cost at maiden rock and brewer which will reoccur at about the same level as what was spent in the first quarter railcar storage totaled approximately  at the end of the first quarter down from  at the end of  excess railcar costs for the first quarter were  million or  per ton as we previously stated there is onetime cost associated with pulling railcars out of storage which somewhat offset the benefits of having fewer cars in storage in the first quarter however excess railcar cost still decreased by  million or  per ton we currently have less than  cars in storage and we expect to have all our cars back in service by the end of the second quarter since we expect that well be pulling so many cars out of storage in the second quarter well incur more onetime cost in the quarter but still expect excess railcar cost per ton to decrease by the third quarter we believe excess railcar costs will be  as we look longer term of each of our  renegotiations with our railcar suppliers is that we have the ability to pull forward some railcar deliveries if necessary that are currently scheduled for  and  we also expect to utilize customer cars to better maximize the efficiency of our fleet further improved use of our unit train capabilities allows us to turn cars faster within our railcar fleet our ir segments gross profit for the fourth quarter was  million a  increase from comparable  first quarter gross profit of  million due mainly to the benefit from higher prices across the entire segment in greater volumes and our recreation and building products valueadded product lines coupled with cost per ton improvements from higher efficiencies and fixed cost leverage gross margin percentage for ir increased to  in the first quarter versus  in the fourth quarter of  and  in the first quarter of  sga for the quarter was  million which included  million in noncash stock compensation expense this compares to  million of sga in the fourth quarter of  which included  million of noncash stock compensation expense and  million of professional fees for the fourth quarter equity offerings the increase in comparison to prior year spending is primarily driven by a higher investment in rd and our technical sales force which added over  million in expense in the first quarter and  million increase in shortterm variable compensation and benefit plan contribution expense on our improved performance for the second quarter we expect that sga will range between  million and  million including noncash compensation expense – noncash stock compensation expense of approximately  million we currently anticipate that this will be our sga run rate for the remainder of  primarily due to the additional technical and rd investments sga also included a higher variable compensation due to our expected increase in performance over the year including the expected contribution to our benefit plan – benefit plans at an annual base wage increase both of which were suspended last year interest expense in the quarter was  million an  decline from  million in the fourth quarter as a result of having the full effect of lower outstanding debt following the debt prepayments and repurchases in the fourth quarter depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the first quarter was  million versus  million in the fourth quarter of  the increase from the prior quarter was driven by amortization of our propel ssp intangible asset as we now have fully begun commercial sales of propel ssp in  in the first quarter we recorded a tax benefit of  million and our effective tax rate was  the decrease in the effective rate from prior periods is due to a  valuation allowance against tax assets which under accounting rules do not allow us to record a current tax benefit for our losses for the full year we expect our effective tax rate to be  due to the benefits noted above and due to partial reversal of the valuation allowance we had a net loss for the first quarter of  million or  per share compared with a net loss of  million or  loss per share in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was  million for the first quarter of  compared with adjusted ebitda of  million in the fourth quarter of  adjusted ebitda in the first quarter excludes noncash stock compensation expense of  million but includes  in startup cost for our brewer and maiden rock mines adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter excludes noncash compensation expense of  million and income of roughly  million which was a combination of multiple factors including the gain on the repurchase of our debt which was offset in part by asset impairment expenses the sequential increase in adjusted ebitda was largely due to higher volumes improved pricing and the mixed shift toward valueadded products in both our proppant solutions and industrial and recreational segments cash flow from operations was  million for the first  months of  as a result of improved operating results led by volume and pricing improvements along with the shift mix that i mentioned in the valueadded products included in operating cash inflows for the quarter was approximately  million of tax refunds received in the quarter thus far in the second quarter we received  million in tax refunds due to prior year loss carrybacks for the remainder of the year we expect to receive an additional  million in tax refunds from prior year benefits and we believe our excess free cash flow from operations will improve capital expenditures for the first quarter of  totaled  million primarily related to maintenance and startup of our brewer and maiden rock facilities for the full year we continue to believe our capital expenditures will be in a range of  million to  million the companys debt balance at the end of the first quarter was approximately  million and net debt was at  million all major remaining maturities are due in the third quarter of  which provides us good flexibility but well look to refinance these maturities during  to periods beyond  in addition to potentially further reducing our overall debt as our free cash flow continues to improve also were pleased with  recent upgrades to our credit ratings including fitchs initial credit rating of b for the stable outlook and sps recent revision to b rating with a stable outlook a positive development from the prior b rating with a negative outlook this reflects the progress weve made in improving our capital structure over the past year which well continue to make further enhancements to as of march   company had a cash of  million compared to  million at december   total liquidity at the end of quarter was roughly  million including  million of unused availability under our revolving credit facility as a reminder under the covenants of our bank credit agreement the amount of available credit on this facility would increase up to  million less outstanding letters of credit as our ebitda run rate improves and if we achieve a leverage ratio of x – x or less currently our outstanding letters of credit totaled  million now ill turn the call back to jenniffer to provide more – some insight in the current market conditions as well as comments on other key focus areas jenniffer deckard thanks michael so far in the second quarter demand for proppant has continued to strengthen with demand for finer grades continuing to stay on the heavier side however demand for coarser grades is also rising due to their greater availability and to inherent well designs this improvement in demand for coarser sand helps us to drive efficiency throughout our operation with better balance to our production mix which both reduces the nominal cost of dumping tons as well as increases our overall cost leverage given our consistently constrained capacity for finer grades this increasing coarsegrade products also allowed us to grow our overall volumes in the first quarter and to increase our effective capacity utilization to over  us rig counts have continued to rise in the second quarter and are currently around  above first quarter averages this trend in rig counts is a positive indicator for raw sand demand and also for our valueadded coated proppants for which demand has also continued to increase in the second quarter following a very strong first quarter growth proppant intensity per well continues to be a tailwind and we expect this to continue this strengthening demand along with the recent realignment of our supply agreement also allowed us to improve our pricing on raw frac sand at the beginning of the second quarter we expect raw frac sand pricing will increase by an average of  to  per ton in the second quarter versus the first quarter if market conditions continue to improve which we currently believe will be the case we expect to implement further price increases in the third quarter given rig counts and proppant intensity trends we estimate the annualized market demand is currently in the range of  million tons and will likely average around  million tons for  based on further industry expectations that both rig count and proppant intensity per well will continue to rise we estimate that market demand could surpass  million tons in  available sand supply is currently tight particularly for finer grades and if forecast for  demand become a reality the market will need to bring capacity online and it will need to do so in excess of demand due to inherent grade imbalances as well as other operational considerations we believe the additional industry capacity that is coming online will be necessary to meet expected future demand the capacity expansion announcements in the industry will increase production of both regional and northern white sands we believe both types of sand will play a meaningful role as the market continues to gain momentum regional sand does have cost advantages in this specific basin and will likely serve an ongoing role in the long term industry supply particularly for those users who are more focused on shorterterm completion cost northern white sand plays a critical role in all basins including those with local sand availability including the permian its quality and productivity advantages are and will continue to be important to many producers additionally regional sand production in west texas is heavily skewed towards the finer grades which means that even as local capacity is added northern white sand will be important in meeting the gap between demand for specific grades and local supply in those basins the demand that northern white will continue to fill for all grades is even more pronounced if projections for increased permian demand holds true along the more nearterm lines of tight supply to meet growing market demand wed like to provide an update on fairmounts current capacity and the restart of our brewer and maiden rock facilities which we announced on our last earnings call were pleased to report that the rampup of production is progressing as planned and we expect both facilities to be at full production capacity by the middle of the second quarter the combined stated capacities at these  facilities is  million tons which will bring the companys total annual stated proppant capacity to  million tons in addition to these plants startup weve also made recent improvements at our voca texas facility voca has a stated capacity of  million tons annually however the effective capacity has consistently been closer to  million tons due mainly to processing constrains were making a small capital investment to increase the effective capacity by  tons to  tons per year which we expect to narrow the gap between our stated and effective capacities we expect that project to be completed sometime in this second quarter of  outside of these effective capacity additions we still have approximately  million tons of idled annual capacity from our hager bay our shakopee and our wexford locations that could also be activated should we decide to bring additional capacity online reopening these idled facilities would be our first priority due to the lower capital investment required and the speed to market all of these plans will be profitable at todays pricing level however before we initiate reactivation of any idled facility we would secure solid customer volume commitments to help ensure the longterm viability of these facilities on a topic of commitments with our customers wed like to discuss our longheld philosophy regarding the structure of our contracts in addition to securing additional supply agreements over the past  months weve completed a restructuring of our legacy agreement while the individual terms vary by agreement annual volumes are generally fixed and collectively bring balance to our product mix and stability to our volumes this approach has served the company very well throughout industry cycle pricing is generally a function of market pricing which can usually be updated quarterly depending on underlying market conditions and due to the recently completed restructuring starting in the second quarter the cadence of any pricing adjustments will be more uniform across our customer base with any adjustments now being made at the beginning of any applicable quarter this change will be helpful to both fairmount santrol and to our customer base in managing our commitments its our observation that the terms spot pricing and market pricing are sometimes viewed interchangeably but there is an important distinction spot pricing while indicative of market direction is generally transactional and is applicable to noncommitted and generally smaller overall volumes while market pricing is generally determined by more representative transactions or series of transactions for similarly situated product with similar product characteristics our contracts structure gives us flexibility to adjust prices depending on underlying supply and demand dynamics they do allow us to lead the market in pricing as we did with our announcement in the third quarter of  as well as to follow pricing so there will also be times that our pricing may temporarily lag spot pricing up or down however over time market pricing tends to converge with spot pricing one other benefit of our longterm volume contracts is that the combination of our contracts generally cover the breadth of our product offerings and so it helps us to balance and to plan our production to more effectively meet market demand longterm contracts also play an important role in helping us to plan for longterm capacity we recently expanded or added several customer contracts in order to be in line with our preference for maintaining volume commitments above  of effective capacities these contract moves were completed in anticipation of reactivating both brewer and maiden rock whose production has been substantially allocated to customers with longterm contracts moving to our logistics unit trains continue to play an increasingly important role in our network and accounted for over  of our northern white volumes shipped in the first quarter we also recently opened an additional unit train terminal bringing us to a total of  unit train distribution points we expect another unit train terminal to go into service during the third quarter of  a further benefit of unit train is that we were able to reduce cycle time and get more turns from each railcar thus reducing the total number of cars that would otherwise be needed in addition to cost advantages this will likely become a more meaningful advantage as the railcar supplydemand cycle evolves to the oil and gas upcycle as industry demand forecast grow we believe that our extensive logistics network will continue to be an important valueadd for us and for our customers another key valueadd on which id like to provide an update is propel ssp we saw good growth in demand in quarter  as users were able to leverage propel ssp to both gain productivity and operational efficiencies which are valuable to both ep and service companies the productivity enhancements that propel ssp provide have been well demonstrated through many trial wells in different basins over the past  years weve also spent the last several months documenting the operational efficiencies that propel ssp can also provide including a proven  reduction in water usage and pumping times versus slickwater for wells that are optimized for use of propel ssp we believe these  areas will become a more important focus area for both operators and oilfield service companies as production needs increase and available completion equipment and water resources become tighter we work closely with our partners to demonstrate propel ssps unique value proposition and remain upbeat on its prospects wed now like to provide a little more color regarding expectations for the second quarter we currently expect total company volumes in the second quarter to be between  million tons and  million tons and to realize an average raw sand price increase of  to  per ton over quarter  averages on a like basis additionally as michael mentioned we believe the average cost per ton in our proppant solutions segment will remain fairly flat to slightly up in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter even with the startup of our brewer and maiden rock mines demand for raw sand continues to rise especially for fine grades and increasingly for coarser grades as well and we expect to sell a large majority of the incremental production coming from the restart of maiden rock and brewer we also expect volume growth in our valueadded products group in the second quarter for our ir segment after a very strong first quarter we expect modest yearoveryear volume growth in the second quarter with solid underlying demand now carol could you please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions and our first question this morning comes from ole slorer from morgan stanley please go ahead ole slorer yeah hi very good morning and congrats with very strong numbers and a good setup running into the second quarter jenniffer deckard good morning ole slorer i think its clear here that the market isnt necessarily concerned about the ability to deliver the  million tons that you think the market could grow to next year but instead getting concerned about the fact that capacity is now expanding from  million tons to  million tons assuming that most are sold out at the time when kind of oil prices are taking a scary direction and setting us off potentially for a doubledigit in activity so i wonder whether you could talk to the flexibility that you have with respect to the balance sheet that still has quite a lot of debt on it and the capex that you committed to relative to the ability to derisk by paying down debt if you should sort of see a different trajectory we can all understand the bold case but could you talk us a little bit through how youre thinking about the other end of the risk curve michael biehl sure happy to do that as we’ve indicated in all opportunities we do in september  so we do feel we have some time and flexibilities evaluate the actions that we have and again our current target continues to be  million of net debt by the end of  as we’ve previously stated and we continue to build our cash balance and expect to generate significant free cash flow remainder of this year that could be used to further pay down our debt so we are on course to hit that  million i think the ability to do it we continue to evaluate refinancing our debt the different opportunities that we have as are our operations improve over the year and once better faster company’s operations and also add value for shareholders our capex range of  to  that includes maintenance capex between  million and  million so if we had to scale it back we could do that pretty rapidly and if there were certain mines that we’re in the process reopening that there was a concern we could sales scale that back or we not open them but we believe that going to happen we think the market’s going to continue to be strong jenniffer deckard yeah ole slorer that’s helpful i just look through – understand the flexibility around that clearly here in the second third quarter you will generate ton of cash regardless and i was just willing to wanting you to elaborate the robustness around that relative to your refinancing requirements later in the year and clearly a significantly improved yearoveryear position just jenniffer deckard ole i would also add to that in the event you mentioned the double digit i think that fairmount did an excellent job of demonstrating also our flexibility operationally in both scaling down and scaling up that was painful but i think we executed on that as well so we also i think have flexibility on the operational side as well ole slorer my second question is this trend towards some experimentation with very fine mesh and how would that impact your business wouldnt that typically be the kind of product that you today sell in your industrial product lines jenniffer deckard were aware of the discussions around micro proppants and potential benefits that they may provide at this point we do believe thats still experimental and were having conversations with the customer im watching that closely we do not currently sell what was formerly referred to as ground silica into the ir markets we actually used to do that but in the s we discontinued all of those operations from our view of the elevated risk tied to respirable silica and which of course is the leading cause of silicosis so we went away from that with the new technologies and a focus on safety should that trend occur we could produce micro proppants with a small investment at our plants but we would just need to further that discussion to justifying the investments before we would make that move ole slorer okay thanks for that i’ll hand it back jenniffer deckard thanks operator our next question comes from jim wicklund from credit suisse please go ahead jim wicklund well i guess its a little bit of a followup on oles question and then much better quarter than last quarter what would it take in your opinion for investors to understand or believe that we arent going to according to one time i think you recently were going to so expand capacity that pricing is going to go to  and all this equity value for frac sand companies is going to be wiped out what has to happen what do you think investors need to see before theyre convinced that thats not going to be the case is it just time jenniffer deckard i think the most important thing for investors to see is a path to continue to growth on the demand side to meet the projected growth in supply and i think that all of the indicators thus far on proppant intensity have continued to hold and i think thats a positive tailwind as well and oil prices we cant predict them we can only follow what the industry experts are saying and as well as rig counts but most of those things are continuing to increase but we do think that given the estimates for rig counts thats just over between  and  with that type of a rig count is where we think the industry would go  million plus tons so its all dependent on rig count and proppant intensity jim wicklund okay and then my followup if i could youre reopening your  mines reactivating your  mines that will increase your capacity but as you noted demand continues to be relentless in its growth and so i would expect that in  fairmount would have to either expand existing capacity or develop new mines and of course you had the voca facility and weve all seen that every time someone opens a texas mine at some point you devalue wisconsin can you talk about what perhaps the additions you think youre going to need through  and where might they be – do you have a strategic preference in terms of your next new mine locations michael biehl well we currently have  idled raw fracs facilities at shakopee hager bay and wexford which would add around  million tons and we could bring those online in  to  months with minimal investment shakopee is located on the up and it has been skewed toward the coarser grades hager bay is the unit train capable plant located on the bnsf and wexford is a more regional sand location in michigan we continue to be disciplined when it comes to deploying capital and we continue to evaluate the options that really provide a complementary fit beyond our existing facilities and provide a strong return on invested capital for our shareholders given the everchanging market dynamics our valuation is focused on both short and longterm demand as well as options that are adjacent to our current product offerings obviously whether theres an option for expansion we have existing permitted reserves and its a known asset for us however given recent trends towards the regional and local sands and a changing market dynamics were evaluating the best option for us longer term to meet customer demands and market needs and we commented in the past we have done an extensive search in the permian basin and continue to do so and well continue to evaluate what we believe is best for us long term and for our shareholders in terms of making investments and where we expect the market to go over the next several years jim wicklund okay thats helpful thank you very much i appreciate that operator our next question comes from marc bianchi from cowen please go ahead marc bianchi thank you first question on brewer and maiden rock i guess im a little bit surprised on the ramp time there curious if you could talk about maybe some of the challenges that you have and perhaps the challenges for the industry in general trying to bring on capacity that might have been idled michael biehl as we stated previously it takes roughly  to  months to open up these facilities the longer timing is largely due to acquiring resources particularly capital equipment and employees to staff the plants weve been lucky that for brewer and maiden rock plants weve had a high return of employees that exited the company in the downturn there is a lag time to acquire capital equipment primarily mobile equipment which has a little bit longer lead time but we think weve got that pretty much in place and were ready to go and were making good progress on both of these facilities to have them at full capacity and as i think weve mentioned we did sell some capacity from those plants in the first quarter but they are not at full capacity yet we expect them to be at full capacity this month jenniffer deckard i would add to that michael just kudos to our operational team our logistics team our sales team because as you mentioned i think we hit the low side of that  to  months to full capacity and i think we would ship within  weeks so that just has to ramp up and a good deal is that weve got to bring a lot of labor and people on board and we do that prudently and carefully and i think the operations team did a fantastic job marc bianchi thanks for that i guess along the same lines youve restarted brewer and maiden rock slightly higher cost in wedron and then weve got shokapee hager bay wexford kind of next in line as you look at your supply footprint and the cost curve that exists how does that compare to what the rest of the industry has and do you have any thoughts on what the cost curve looks like for the industry as things restart you mentioned the  to  of price improvement are there thresholds where you think there is a lot more supply that comes on and could you talk to that maybe more broadly for the industry jenniffer deckard so ill talk about fairmount santrol in that cost curve and maybe first of all i think that last quartile of the cost curve that is likely active and depending on where supply comes into the market may well remain in active we believe that fairmount is on the first quartile on that side of that cost curve and the rest of our plan somewhere in the second and third quartile that we want to continue on so i believe that that will be the dynamics the cost curve i think at the far right its really hard to talk about the cost curve at the mine because the importance is the river and the basin and i think thats where you gain the importance of unit trains being located on rail and i think thats really what pushes many of our locations to the left of the effective cost of getting into basin marc bianchi and jenniffer what would you say are – not commenting on the absolute numbers because of all the variety of variables that you mentioned but if you think about the relative is it a  difference between the low cost and the medium cost or is it something larger and then between the medium cost and the high cost just curious if you could help put some numbers around that for us jenniffer deckard sure i would say low to medium a  range is probably a good proxy and i think it can get to plus in the fourth – in the far right marc bianchi okay last one for me on the quoted or the valueadded you may have commented and i might have missed – misinterpreted that there were shipments in march that really picked up was that – did i read that correctly that there was an acceleration at the end of the quarter or were you just commenting on the march quarter overall with that statement jenniffer deckard really the – there wasnt a significant rampup at the end of – in march however march was probably a little bit higher than january and february so there was a slight ramp in march but it was not material marc bianchi okay thanks very much i will turn in back jenniffer deckard thank you operator our next question comes from george oleary from tph  company please go ahead george oleary good morning guys michael biehl good morning george jenniffer deckard good morning george george oleary so quick question i thought it was really helpful that you guys provided kind of q volume color of the  million tons to  million tons not trying to drill down too much but just wondering if you could bifurcate that between the proppant side versus the industrial and recreational side maybe even if you can just provide color on whether or not you see as material increase on the ir side that would help us gauge kind of the split between those two michael biehl no it wouldnt be a material increase on the ir side its pretty consistent with probably the increase we saw in the first quarter sort of flattish to slightly up so you can back that off and gauge where the proppant side is going george oleary okay thats helpful and then q – or thinking about pricing just across grades at this point in time today or middle of the second quarter which you guys are expecting to sell you talked a little bit about pricing levels per se   mesh and  and then maybe also talk a little bit about resin pricing the volumes have taken a nice increase if you just look at the – and i know there is some lumpiness there but just the last  quarters the quarterly increases if averaged out have been quite attractive any movement on pricing on the resin side or is that just the volume game at this point jenniffer deckard resin i would expect we consistently guide at likeforlike this is significant mix differentials within resin but likeforlike we always look at pricing still relatively flat the interesting thing is that we really are seeing price improvements across all the grades a little bit heavier on the finer meshes but not dramatically and i think that speaks to the balance of our commitments george oleary its helpful and maybe if i can sneak in one more we continue to hear and seeing some of the data that the duc count is growing continue to hear that folks are having some challenges getting frac crews put back to work and completion is lagging drilling just curious what you guys are seeing and if theres maybe any pentup demand that you guys can sense from the services companies or the eps that you sell to that are looking to kind of close that gap between completions and drilling jenniffer deckard i think our estimates are that well continue in the second quarter we see a slight increase in ducs and then perhaps in the third and fourth maybe start to see some decline we think that is more a function of completion equipment and crews versus developed already or capability of getting sand george o’leary thanks very much guys good quarter jenniffer deckard thank you michael biehl thank you operator our next question comes from william thompson from barclays please go ahead william thompson hey good morning jenniffer i just wanted to get a clarification may be on what you said to marc that the  spread between sort of the low end of the cost curve and the mean of the cost curve is that delivered cost basis or just kind of mine production cost jenniffer deckard thats a great question william and as i said we will start speaking to the planned cost operationally and the point is that thats not the whole story nor that even the majority of the story but to talk about the cost curve otherwise it would have to be specific not only into each basin but actually into each terminal and into each kind of cluster of well activity william thompson but if we think about northern white and the certain basins it would be much steeper than that given the delivered cost curve jenniffer deckard i think as you compare northern white to northern white i think the next thing in addition to the plant cost curve would be rail and the most – the  components are one are you sitting on rails for the transload to get from your plant to a transload which can be  to  and then do you have unit train capability which can be  to  and what is your rate versus tariff on the rails so those are the  larger increases relative to getting into basin and then how close is either your inbasin mine or your terminal to the well site because that last mile those short miles become very expensive both in relative to how far they are from the well and also how tight is the trucking because if that trucking gets tighter those rates will increase i would say those are the  things to focus on if youre thinking about competitive cost comparisons william thompson okay thats very helpful and then jenniffer or michael just the moving parts around contribution margins the  to  that you mentioned restructuring pricing agreement so to set pricing earlier in the quarter is that already been rolled out that  to  price increase and then that obviously applies going to over  of contribution margin next quarter you have the unabsorbed railcars obviously there is – that can be offset with pulling the rails out of storage but i mean that obviously sets up a pretty strong growth in third quarter just trying to understand the moving parts there thank you jenniffer deckard so william i think if you actually just outline them all exactly correctly and i would say the  to  is based on what has already been implemented as of april  and that is just the raw frac only just want to mention we talked about resins are being flat but that is on raw frac sand across the board william thompson and as i sneak one more in just addressing some confusion around tempered and curable and then maybe you mentioned the curable for flowback issues is that pertaining to the permian basin you just maybe talk about on a geological basis how we should think about where that curable demand is and is there any resurgence in tempered given activity increasing some of these nonpermian basins jenniffer deckard its a great question i think that we did see some increase for the first time in our tempered products particularly in the fourth quarter and the acceleration in the first quarter was more related to curables and the tempered youll see those products used in deeper wells with higher closure strength because you need that added strength and tempered provides that the curables are going to be used across all basins where a flowback is experienced and that is not only in every basin but its also within different plays for example in the permian in those fracked plays some you experience flowback in some and not in others william thompson is curable used with other raw sands just thinking about – is it complimentary for some jenniffer deckard yes thats a great question its generally used with raw frac sands or if you have a curable to flowback for attempts they can be used with tempered sand but its typically at the tail end so you frac the first part of the stage with raw frac sand or ceramics or tempered resin and then you tail in with a curable to create that lock for the proppant so call it  to  william thompson it’s helpful thank you jenniffer deckard welcome operator our next question comes from blake hancock from howard weil please go ahead blake hancock thanks good morning guys jenniffer i wanted to talk i hate to harp on pricing but wanted to go back to kind of the comments youve made the  and  in q can you maybe talk about what were seeing actually in the spot market and i believe you said q could possibly be up more than what we saw in q can you just clarify that make sure we understand what were seeing in the spot versus your market pricing and the asp and then how that might – if we continue on this progression does q stand to be greater – show a greater increase than what we saw in q jenniffer deckard so the third quarter i would say we dont have a comment on the magnitude of the price increases so we will be working through that here in the next  weeks we certainly are seeing on the high end spot pricing that can be upwards of in the low to mids and remember that we have – the large majority of our products are sold to contracted customers that has been long our focus and so we will tend to move toward – the market will move toward spot pricing and we will converge to market pricing blake hancock okay thats great and then i guess as we think about those  mines left to reactivate can you just kind of – if we think about full capacity with the  reactivated today versus kind of full capacity of reactivating the next  can you help us kind of think about what the impact would be on a normalized kind of cost per ton basis just so we have an idea of if you bring the  million on what that could do to your average cost jenniffer deckard remember when – we have talked about that we dont necessarily bring plants online relative to their total cost but i would say relative to our existing footprint which includes of course wedron maiden rock voca the average cost of the plants that we bring online will be higher than our cost is today but that will also be spread across now  million tons to  million tons so the impact it will be up from our average but probably minimally blake hancock okay that’s great i appreciate guys thank you operator our next question comes from brandon dobell from william blair please go ahead brandon dobell thanks maybe take the transportation side for a second if you think about what the right i dont know sustainable or normalized level of fob mine versus inbasin deliveries should look like relative to what your capacity is going to be was this quarter decent proxy or should we see that drift down a handful more percentage points as you bring these other mines online jenniffer deckard our guidance – our formal guidance in the script was that we would expect a little bit higher fob mine as we look forward to the next couple of quarters because of the maiden rock and brewer have a little bit higher percentage of fob mines based on our commitments so were considering that those plants were not fully ramped up that would indicate that we probably have a little bit higher fob mine going forward brandon dobell okay and jenniffer any updated comments on how you guys view last mile solutions and whats your cost control conversations are like around getting sand from various transload facilities to the wellhead these days jenniffer deckard we do not have a significant amount of dialogue with our customers relative to last mile other than as we explore but on a daily basis we dont manage them last mile our service company partners manage the last mile we do of course weve evaluated last mile over the last  years we certainly see the value – the need for last mile service of course but also see the value of the recent innovation that is done in last mile as it relates to efficiency dust mitigation and so forth however we still do not see that as a top priority investment for us in the short run for both strategic and investment priorities brandon dobell okay thanks a lot operator operator instructions and our next question comes from brad handler from jefferies please go ahead brad handler thanks good morning i may have missed this so forgive me if i did but can you speak a little more to your valueadded product outlook for q or would you expect volume increase and maybe i heard that pricing was not increasing but would you expect volume increase jenniffer deckard yes pricing we would expect to be flat on a likeforlike basis but we definitely expect continued growth in our valueadded proppants brad handler okay is that… jenniffer deckard i wouldnt guide to that  growth as i mentioned the typically resincoated volumes correlate quite closely over time with additions in rig count with a couple of months lag we did outpace that in q which we think was – had a few factors including some pentup demand from q and so with those factors in mind we would expect to see an increase relative to kind of leading rig count changes brad handler okay thats helpful can you put ssp comments into the mix here the – obviously you saw some nice uptake based on your commentary do have visibility on that continuing to move forward through the course of  jenniffer deckard we definitely do we see activity for propel ssp and i think what will be important to think about is that we are still in commercialization mode so we will have customers in what we do at  phases one is the trial phase confirmation phase and then commercial phase so all of those of course have different pricing levels as we – as we entice people to try for themselves and so that they can believe what theyre hearing and see with their own wells we entice them with pricing so the mix between commercial and price and trial well will impact the net pricing but we do see continued uplift going forward on volumes brad handler okay let me switch gears please this is an unrelated followup and maybe im forgetting this from a prior call but can you break down the  million in capex michael i think you mentioned  million going into maintenance but can you put that into some other buckets for us so we understand the spend michael biehl the  million to  million again is due to maintenance overall and that would include our maintenance for our new startups but we also put costs in there – capital costs in there for example new lease cost for – not only lease cost but capex cost for our plant startups for equipment that we had to put in place it also includes shifting of about  million there is some – there is a maybe  of those is track expansion  to  is track expansion in logistics and then there is also some allocated to reserve expansion and then also additionally in train investments for terminals brad handler okay the startup expenditure just to be clear thats buried in that  million to  million of maintenance the reactivation michael biehl that  million to  million is the overall maintenance and it would include maintenance of the new plants there is the separate capex for equipment related to the  plants that were starting up brad handler okay and thats – by the way thats because those – that equipment was relocated when you deactivated the plants or is the things just wear out michael biehl combination of both correct brad handler okay thanks i will turn it back operator our next question comes from john daniel from simmons and company please go ahead john daniel hey thanks for getting me in call apologies if i missed this but can you just characterize what percent of the quarteroverquarter volume growth q versus q is likely be the coarsergrade sands jenniffer deckard i would say based upon the capacities that were adding it would be a  probably so its probably a fairly similar product mix john daniel got it okay and then not mistaken i believe you noted an attempt to move pricing higher in q assuming i heard that correctly and assuming demand trends persist as they are today would you expect that q increase to be similar to the  to  a ton you mentioned for q just directionally the same lower or higher would be helpful jenniffer deckard sorry its probably too early for us to give that kind of guidance john daniel okay fair enough but again – are you having those discussions with customers today about the q increases or is that something youd do later this quarter jenniffer deckard it will be starting now so we want to get them probably  days notice so that will be in – those discussions will be happening in may john daniel awesome thanks guys jenniffer deckard thank you operator and this time i’d now like to turn the call back over to jenniffer for closing remarks jenniffer deckard thanks carol and thank you all for joining us today were super optimistic that the strength weve seen thus far in  will continue in the short term and we believe that our fairmount santrol team has well positioned us to take continued advantage of this both in the short run and the long run so as always we appreciate your continued interest in fairmount santrol have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today’s conference you may now disconnect
