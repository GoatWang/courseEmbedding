bachelor of arts degree university of louisville favorite way to relax bass fishing favorite vacation western road trips favorite local restaurant august moon type of music he listens to most’s ’s and little of the ’s what energizesinspires him“after a recent health scare i am energized by simply waking up in the morning and having the opportunity to appreciate my life and my family” why did you get into this profession the financial markets with their ability to expand the economy by leverage and investment have always intrigued me i entered the industry as a financial planner and transitioned into bank management in practice i took what i learned in the abstract as a financial adviser and made it a reality as part of the management team that took our mutual thrift to a publicly traded savings bank in  how is technology changing your area of the financial institutions industry technology is rapidly changing the way customers and clients interact with their financial institutions advancements in technology have allowed individuals to remotely access and control their finances institutions regardless of size must keep pace with technology to avoid being left behind by the market fortunately efficiencies in the costs of these technologies are allowing regional and community banks to provide these same services as the megabanks personally i find great value in the use of “anytime anywhere” access especially with my financial activity what is your biggest concern about your profession even the bestmanaged institutions face the risks from the weight of our federal debt as this debt continues to keep interest rates at historically low levels bankoperating margins continue to compress eventually something will have to give and it’s likely to affect all of us what would you change about the financial institutions industry in the united states i would like to see a change in the taxexempt status that credit unions enjoy this special status is no longer justified this is a trilliondollar industry that is not paying federal taxes as we all know the federal government is not operating at a surplus so someone is making up the difference what advice would you give to someone who wants to build a career similar to yours choose a workplace where you can make a difference learn and utilize the technology associated with the industry describe an experience with a customer that was very gratifying to you on several occasions i have had individuals remind me in conversation that i had handled their mortgage to purchase their first home and how much they appreciated my efforts not to show my age but there was a time when a mortgage was a life event not just a commodity what do you wish more customers understood about the way financial institutions operate i so often see news reports concerning problems stemming from activity in investment banking quickly those reports absorb all areas of banking into their subject problems by referencing the word “bank” the community bank space that i am a part of is far different from the wall street investment banking world i think the public would be surprised by how much community banks have been victimized by the actions of those on wall street why is a career in the financial institutions industry a good choice opportunity for placement appears to be high over the next several years as i attend banking events locally and nationally i find that a majority of executive and senior management officers are approaching retirement age many are reporting a lack of qualified succession candidates there will be a void to be filled by individuals with the right skill sets this presents a great opportunity for those who prepare a proper career path home of the day sponsor
