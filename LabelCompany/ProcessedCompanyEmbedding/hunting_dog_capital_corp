and expenses payable by us and other offering expenses payable by us will be approximately  million we estimate that the expenses relating to our organization and this offering will be approximately  million we intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to capitalize our wholly owned subsidiaries our wholly owned subsidiaries will deploy this capital in part to fund our initial portfolio as described under the heading “initial portfolio” and going forward primarily in various forms of financing including direct loans convertible debt instruments trade finance structured credit and to a lesser extent to acquire preferred and common equity securities proceeds will be allocated to each subsidiary based on their respective opportunities to engage in financing transactions appropriate for the subsidiary pending investment we will invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily in cash cash equivalents us government securities and other highquality investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment we attempt to find opportunities to deploy capital where there is little or no competition and we believe lower middlemarket companies represent the best market for those opportunities competition does however come from various providers of financing to lower middlemarket companies these providers include and could in the future include certain specialty and commercial finance companies business development companies commercial and investment banks private investment funds private mezzanine funds factoring companies insurance companies and other equity and nonequity based investment funds many of these existing and potential competitors have or could have substantially greater financial resources than we do we will however continue to seek opportunities that we believe have little or no competition company description hunting dog capital corp is a holding company that intends to operate through several wholly owned subsidiaries to provide financing solutions to lower middlemarket companies which we define as businesses with revenues between  million and  million and needing financing typically under  million we will seek longterm equity appreciation through modest equity exposure that does not subject us to the risk of material capital loss we intend to conduct our business through wholly owned our subsidiaries which will primarily provide various forms of financing including through direct loans convertible debt instruments trade finance structured credit and to a lesser extent acquire preferred and common equity securities issued by or relating to lower middlemarket companies we anticipate each of these assets will be between  million and  million as an internally managed entity hunting dog capital corp will incur operating expenses but will not pay any management or incentive fees for the management and investment of the proceeds we intend to pursue these opportunities and conduct our operations such that we and our subsidiaries will qualify for exemptions under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” additionally as part of this offering we will acquire  of the membership interests of hunting dog capital llc an investment manager of lower middlemarket private debt funds hunting dog capital llc will become our wholly owned subsidiary and continue to manage hd specialsituations ii lp and hd specialsituations iii lp “fund ii” and “fund iii” respectively and collectively the “existing funds” whose assets under management totaled approximately  million and  million as of march   and  respectively as a result we will be entitled to receive the management fees associated with hunting dog capital llc’s management of each of the existing funds we will not however be entitled to receive any incentive fees associated with operating performance of the existing funds instead certain of our directors and executive officers will continue to be entitled to receive those incentive fees hunting dog capital llc receives a management fee from each of the existing funds equal to a percentage of aggregate capital commitments to each fund until the expiration of each fund’s investment period at which point the management fee is calculated as a percentage of the value of the fund’s investment portfolio hunting dog capital llc will no longer be entitled to receive a management fee from the existing funds at the earlier of i the date on which all of such fund’s investments have been realized or ii in the case of fund iii september   fund ii’s investment period has expired and it therefore currently pays hunting dog capital llc a management fee based on its approximately  million investment portfolio as of march   fund iii’s investment period has also expired and it therefore currently pays hunting dog capital llc a management fee based on its approximately  million investment portfolio as of march   for the fiscal years ended december   and  and the three months ended march   hunting dog capital llc earned management fees of approximately  million  million and  million respectively historical management fees and anticipated future management fees relate exclusively to assets under management in the existing funds and as noted above do not include incentive fees for the period of october   through march   the existing funds generated gross returns on called capital ie the capital we have requested from the commitments made to us by investors of approximately  without the use of “leverage” borrowing funds to enhance equity holders’ returns and without any material capital gains through march   fund ii generated a cumulative net return of  for the same period the cumulative net return of fund iii was  as of march   the portfolios of the existing funds were comprised of i fourteen discrete senior secured loans to twelve borrowers and ii three control equity positions that were originally structured as senior secured termloans returns are typically lower at the outset of a fund as it absorbs setup expenses and adds incomegenerating assets we have been able to generate these returns while maintaining a senior position by typically structuring loans to allow the borrower to pay only interest during the term of our loans with the full principal amount due at maturity as well as requiring that the borrower give us only a nominal equity interest if any in exchange for our loans we believe that this structure provides our borrowers with greater flexibility to develop their business while maintaining ownership of their company for which they are willing to pay higher interest rates gross and net irrs reflect historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of our future results while the company’s financing activities will be differentiated from those of the existing funds the returns generated by the existing funds are an example of the management team’s ability to generate returns by making senior secured termloans to lower middlemarket companies the loans made by the existing funds and those made by the company and our subsidiaries will be characterized by two common traits • they are all secured by tangible collateral the value of which typically exceeds the amount of the loan and • the borrowers typically have significant atrisk equity we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to capitalize our wholly owned subsidiaries none of the proceeds of this offering will be invested in the existing funds they will deploy this capital in various forms of financing to lower middlemarket companies unable to access sufficient amounts of traditional financing such as bank debt or private equity on terms acceptable to their owners we believe usbased lower middlemarket companies represent a market both underserved by institutional capital and capable of generating favorable riskadjusted returns for investors we believe that historically however access to these opportunities has been limited such that individual and institutional investors have been unable to participate efficiently in this market segment the significant time and effort required and the cost of sourcing new opportunities among lower middlemarket companies are disproportionately high relative to the typically small transaction size since its inception in  however hunting dog capital llc has developed a proprietary transactionreferral network that consists of over  sources across the united states specializing in raising capital for this market segment this network provides hunting dog capital llc access to hundreds of opportunities on an annual basis and will enable us to maintain a high level of selectivity in those opportunities we intend to use this network of sources to enable us to access opportunities to finance the needs of lower middlemarket companies in transactions that fit within our investment
