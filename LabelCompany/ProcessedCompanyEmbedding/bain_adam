president of global revenue and partnerships speaks at a press conference in jakarta in august photo romeo gacad afpgetty imagesconnecttweet  linkedincommentemailmoresan francisco — adam bain has  followers on twitter but that doesnt begin to describe his followinghes so wellliked inside twitter headquarters that the hashtag adambainissonice recently trended on the social media servicebain the companys president of global revenue and partnerships is just as popular in the worlds of advertising media sports and entertainment where he has connections that are the envy of the tech industryhes like sara lee nobody doesnt like adam bain said michael kassan founder and ceo of advisory firm medialink which acts as a consultant to many tech companies including twitterbain who hailed from news corps fox sports and fox interactive media unit joined twitter in  when it had a small sales team and few ad products on his watch twitter increased revenues from  million in  to more than  billion in  and is expected to surpass  billion this yearbut now that revenue growth rates are slowing — in july twitter reported its smallest quarterly revenue growth as a publicly traded company — user growth has stalled and the stock twtr is flirting with historic lows pressure on bain is growingthe single biggest reason why adam bain is important to twitter is because he has been able to keep the revenue stream going even in the face of all of twitters challenges says debra aho williamson an analyst at research firm emarketerand that puts bain in contention for a more prominent role he and founder jack dorsey are frontrunners to be the new ceo of twitter following previous ceo dick costolos departure earlier this summerdorsey is filling the position temporarily during a search that is looking inside and outside of twitter another possibility being floated bain will be promoted to president and chief operating officer under dorseythe knock on bain hes not a founder and he may be too nice to challenge dorsey for the top job another concern on wall street he may have the makings of a ceo but he has no ceo experience which could be a major challenge as twitter faces an increasingly uncertain futurethe san francisco company said last month that  million people signed in to use the service at least once a month during the second quarter making it onefifth the size of rival facebook which has nearly  billion userstwitter beat wall street estimates with  million in secondquarter revenue a  yearoveryear jump that followed an unexpected revenue shortfall when twitter blew wall streets and its own projections twitter has yet to post a profitwe know adam bain can build an ad business but does that mean he can build a company williamson said its a good question to askfor now bain isnt speaking publicly about itfrom my perspective im doing the one thing that i know how to do which is scale the revenue for the company he recently told cnbcthats the kind of grounded response people who know bain expect the yearold executive gives conflict and controversy a wide bertha happygolucky workaholic who barely sleeps at night he cranks out emails at  am on his twitter profile he describes himself as dad of  under  insomniacbain oversees more than half of twitters strong workforce while crisscrossing the country each year in a quest to spread the twitter gospel hopping red eyes and pulling allnighters with the vigor of a college kidhe isnt human when it comes to being able to go with minimal sleep says ravi narasimhan who worked with bain at fox and at twitter and now works at google photo jeff chiu associated pressthe relentlessly energetic bain cant sleep because his mind is always active says chris blandy fox networks groups executive vice president of technology solutions hes always searching for something new and interestingat fox sports where he was vice president of production and development bain teamed with blandy to broadcast one of the first webcasts of a college football game after the networks passed on it they also experimented with ways to deliver novel digital experiences such as creating online games that used live pitch data from major league baseball so that people could try to hit the same pitch they had just seen thrown on the television broadcastwe did a lot of outofthebox thinking taking advantage of stuff in the broadcast and coming up with digital manifestations of it blandy says every day was a brainstorming session with himthat pluck caught the attention of the news corp honchos who tapped bain to become executive vice president of product and technology at fox interactive media which spearheaded the acquisitions of myspace and ignwhile overseeing the technology used across news corps portfolio of companies bain developed one of the first hypertargeted ad technologies by buying narasimhans company strategic data corpnarasimhan recalls bain demonstrating the volume of data myspace had gathered from peoples profiles realizing it was an abstract concept for people to grasp bain would go into presentations with a couple hundredthousand shotgun pellets each representing  data points hed have the audience close their eyes while he poured the pellets into a massive tin bucketwith the sound of all those pellets falling into the bucket i cant tell you how quickly the whole audience grokked that this was a lot narasimhan saidin  twitter had privately set the goal of reaching more than  billion in annual revenue but had done little in the way of building an advertising business

costolos former company feedburner but google snapped it up nonetheless bain stayed close to costolo in early  costolo twitters ceo sought out bain to get advice on how twitter could make moneybain was intrigued by the idea of building advertising that was not inyourface banner ads but something native to the twitter experience yet he was reluctant to uproot his family from los angeles he had just bought a new house and had a second childtwitter was persistent and ultimately persuasive the day bain was handed the keys to the new house was the same day he accepted the job on his first day working for twitter in september  he was told he had three days to present his plan to the board of directors for turning hashtags into dollars he had fewer than a dozen people on his staff and close to zero revenuebain presented two options traditional banner ads that would take off quickly or a slower path which was developing a new more userfriendly form of advertising called promoted tweets where marketers pay to have their tweets shown to users the board seized on the lattertwitter hits week low on warning turnaround will take timewith his family still in la bain fell into the rhythm of

google twitter was not on the dance card of one of the worlds largest advertisers so bain hit a unilever luncheon bouncing around like a jumping bean spending  minutes at each table to pitch all of
