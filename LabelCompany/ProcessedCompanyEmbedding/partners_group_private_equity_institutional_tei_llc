may be extended amended or canceled in various other circumstances described in item av above � x������������the purchase of units pursuant to the offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the fund of members that do not tender units� members that retain their units may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the fund�s aggregate assets resulting from payment for the units tendered� these risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification� the fund believes however that this result is unlikely given the nature of the fund�s investment program� a reduction in the aggregate assets of the fund may result in members that do not tender units bearing higher costs to the extent that certain expenses borne by the fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline� these effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions for units are made by new and existing members from time to time� payment for units purchased pursuant to the offer may also require the fund to tender a portion of its interest in the master fund via the offshore fund� such a tender by the fund could result in the adviser being required to raise cash to accommodate the tender by liquidating portfolio holdings in the master fund earlier than the adviser would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated potentially resulting in losses or increased investment related expenses for the master fund� in addition to its own operating expenses the fund also bears a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of the master fund and the offshore fund � xi������������not applicable � xii����������the following discussion is a general summary of the

them of a purchase of their units by the fund pursuant to the offer � a member who sells all or some of the members units to the fund will generally recognize income or gain only to the extent the amount of cash received by the member exceeds the members adjusted tax basis in the members entire investment at that time� the members adjusted tax basis in the members units will be reduced by the amount of any cash received by the member from the fund and any excess of that cash over that basis will generally constitute capital gain for the member� it is possible however that members might recognize some ordinary income by reason of the sale under certain technical rules that apply to the extent a member disposes of the members share of unrealized receivables of a limited liability company as defined in internal revenue code section � no loss will be recognized by a member on such a sale to the fund except that a member who sells the members entire investment to the fund may recognize a capital loss at the time of the determination of the postaudit payment to the extent the aggregate cash received and to be received by the member is less than the members adjusted tax basis in the units �   not applicable � b����������� ���any units to be purchased from any officer director or affiliate of the fund will be on the same terms and conditions as any other purchase of
