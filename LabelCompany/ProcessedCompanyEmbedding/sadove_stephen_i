principal at stephen sadove and associates and a founding partner of jw levin partners an advisory and investment firm sadove serves as a lead director of colgate palmolive and ruby tuesday and also serves on the boards of aramark and jc penney in addition sadove chairs the board of trustees of hamilton college we spoke with sadove about the value of diversity on the board why it’s needed and how to get it we see boards that are eager to add diverse candidates what do you see from the perspective of a longtime ceo and director sadove i clearly see boards needing to recruit diverse directors the starting point should always be “why do we want to add diversity” i believe that there are sound business reasons and that it shouldn’t be just for the sake of diversity you have to start with an understanding that there is value in a diverse board and that it leads to better results what is the payoff for the board sadove in my experience there is enormous value in having diverse points of view represented on the board—whether those represent gender differences geographic ethnic—people of different backgrounds there is an art to assembling such a board when you do this right you get better quality of discussions including people asking smart questions you may not have considered and better business results how can boards get there sadove boards have to understand not only the value of having diversity but how they get it and then ensure it remains a priority that requires leadership to drive it at every level—the chair the head of the nominating committee as well as other directors they all have to recognize the value of diversity and make sure it is part of every search if diversity is so desirable what’s taking so long sadove very good progress has been made in the area of diversity it is in many of the position specs for director searches one of the limitations has been that many companies have been going after the same candidates what is the solution sadove you have to start weighing and looking at talent in outofthebox venues such as nonprofit and smaller companies or down a level from ceo at the functional level—not where you might traditionally be searching scarcity of diversity at the top is one of the reasons we don’t see the level of diversity we would like on boards however when you get beyond the ceo and into the functions there is a wide range of diverse candidates who could be terrific board members if given the chance what does diversity look like from the board’s point of view sadove you have to balance the value of having a sitting or exceo on the board versus the desire to add a director with digital it or financial expertise for example or someone with international specific regional or even regulatory experience that depends on the nature of the particular demands of the business and the industry but generally speaking diversity should look like a mosaic for an individual company the role of the governance committee and the board is to do some very hard work on a board skills matrix to determine what is needed today and what will be the most important skills to add in the future what are some of the challenges of integrating diverse candidates on the board sadove integrating new directors is always important and a challenge regardless of their background because each board has a different way of operating you have to have an understanding of the board and company cultures so onboarding and orientation are critical to effectiveness as a director onboarding issues can be compounded when someone joins from a lesstraditional background but by and large new directors are all bright and quick studies with the right support they adapt well even if they haven’t run a company what is the role of leadership in ensuring a diverse board sadove leadership—executive leadership and on the board—is critically important in ensuring a diverse culture and especially important in establishing a diverse board the tone is set at the top in my experience lesstraditional candidates make some of the best directors download download related articles boardsgovernance total shareholder return total

this page continue reading the main story this interview with stephen i sadove chairman and chief executive of saks inc was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q what were your biggest leadership lessonsa i used opportunities to get involved and develop relationships with a diverse set of people as opposed to the narrow group of people i was dealing with daytoday and that made a huge difference it shaped my philosophy in terms of the importance of relationshipbuilding it really underlies my entire philosophy of how to run a businessq how did you learn thata in many instances i was taken under the wing of people who gave me an opportunity and also showed some attention and interest where they didn’t necessarily have to back at harvard business school i remember a couple of professors there who paid some attention and in some cases it really led to my love of marketingi was also a reasonably good tennis player back in my college and graduate school days and when i started work at a company called general foods people were always looking for tennis partners if you were a good tennis player you were heavily in demand i found that things like that allowed me to meet people that i otherwise may never have met advertisement continue reading the main story i’ve been amazed over the years how relationships that come out of one thing go toward something else so somebody i might have met through a charity then becomes somebody who knows somebody and it leads to a relationship continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story if you give positive vibes if you show an interest by and large a lot of people will react not everybody but people tend to react when people show an interest in reaching out i tend to react to themq were you always comfortable in leadership rolesa i was the kind of person growing up who was able to play in different circles of people i was never a great athlete i was a good tennis player but i also was on the math team i was able to move from one circle of friends to another so you could be with the topoftheclass people but you could also be just as comfortable with the athletes who maybe didn’t care as much about the academicsi always felt the natural impulse of wanting people to work well together to get whatever the end result was — winning the game getting the team to work together working on the newspaper whatever it might bewhen i got to a business environment it was a natural feeling that hey we’ve got to win but there was also a belief that i had even early on that there were a lot of others who performed as well as i did what started differentiating me was that i would do what was needed to get a job done but also make time to come up with new ideasi also grew up in a very diverse environment my dad was with the world bank in washington all of our friends were of international background you had people from african countries india indonesiaso i grew up in a world of lots of interesting people and you really valued learning from them and talking to them i grew up valuing lots of different kinds of opinions and people of different backgrounds i was relatively comfortable with adults because we always were entertaining so you never worried about being uncomfortable in a setting like that or shyq what about other mentors a i learned a lot from some of the senior executives at general foods there were so many smart people there and you watched how sharp people thought about business issues but i think that what i really learned there was the value of collaboration the value of one and one equals three and not having all the answers yourself i don’t think it was someone telling me as much as seeing how much value you could get if people work together advertisement continue reading the main story i also found so many examples where people were working in silos to me it was just obvious that if people worked together you would get a better result than if you were working independently the first  years of my career i found that getting people to think differently and moving from what i call a vertical organization to a horizontal organization was transformationalq how would you say your leadership and management style has evolveda i spend more time with people and people issues i obviously work with business issues but i try to go out of my way in mentoring coaching and developing young people i tend to care a lot about the people and the relationships that they have how the team is operating the culture photo stephen i sadove chairman and chief executive of saks inc says a company’s leaders set the tone for its culture which in turn can lead to positive results credit tina fineberg for the new york times q give me an example of how you spend time with these people a i’ll take  or so highpotential employees and spend a day with them and i’ll talk to them about culture i’ll talk to them about helping we’ll call it a ceo forum and work directly with them about issues like leadership philosophy of leadership and real business issues that we’re facingq what’s your philosophy of leadershipa i have a very simple model to run a company it starts with leadership at the top which drives a culture culture drives innovation and whatever else you’re trying to drive within a company — innovation execution whatever

to wall street people really want to know your results what are your strategies what are the issues what it is that you’re doing to drive your business they’re focused on the bottom line never do you get people asking about the culture about leadership about the people in the organization yet it’s the reverse because it’s the people the leadership the culture and the ideas that are ultimately driving the numbers and the results so it’s a flipwhat i try to teach people is don’t ask the first question in terms of numbers let’s talk about the people let’s talk about the culture let’s talk about the ideas and the innovationi learn so much from the people in the organization all the time and i also learn from students once or twice a year i’ll go teach at an mba class up at columbia and i love talking to the students because they’ll challenge you and make you think differentlyi think some of the best ideas come from people who aren’t stuck in their ways i always tell people new to my organization when they come in i want you in your first three or four weeks to jot down every time you have an idea or a question about how things are done and then stick it in your drawer just whatever it is why are they doing it this wayi don’t care whether it’s good or bad i don’t want you to even talk to anyone about it just write it down and stick it in the drawer and at the end of three or four weeks i want you to look at the sheet maybe you’ll say “now i understand that now it makes a little bit of sense to me” or you may look at it and say “that still doesn’t make any sense to me” then i want you to sit with me and we’re going to talk about them advertisement continue reading the main story invariably i find some really good ideas that make you say “why are we doing it this way it makes no sense at all” i’ve seen little things big things waste in the system and a lot of duplication of work things like that come out of itq what’s your best career advicea early in your career find the time to do the outofthenorm do whatever’s required to do the job — run the budgets execute the promotions but you’re never going to differentiate yourself just doing what everybody else can do find the time to build relationships outside of your own chain of commandq how do you give feedbacka i like giving feedback every day on the spot it’s important that people know how they’re doing i’m not really big on yearend feedback if there are problems we’ll make sure that they understand the issues that they have to deal with but i really much prefer it being onthespot feedback as opposed to just waiting for everything to build up and then you have the big blowout i don’t see a lot of value in thatthe reality is that people don’t like giving feedback by the way there’s a flip side to it which is that people don’t like to necessarily hear feedback and even when they’re given feedback they oftentimes don’t hear it sometimes you’ll hit people between the eyes and then you’ll see that they didn’t think they got any feedbackq how do you decide when it’s time to let somebody goa i tend to be very halffull versus halfempty and so you want to give the person another opportunity you want to see if they can shift their behavior  degrees i’ll probably be more inclined to give them another shot and more often than not it doesn’t work out and i’ll say “boy i should have let them go earlier” you learn from it and i’m much tougher today on that than i wasbut i’ve seen some wonderful successes too so maybe four out of five don’t work out but that one that’s a homerun — giving them a little bit more time than they otherwise might have had — may make it worth the other fourq how do you hire a well clearly you want somebody who has the intellectual capacity strategic thinking and the skill sets but i’m looking for a cultural fit with me how collaborative are they how inclusive are they how willing are they to listen to lots of different points of view do they have diverse interestsq so what questions do you aska what do you like to do for fun if you had a free evening what do you like to do where do you like to travel what kind of people do you like to spend time with who are the people you admire what have you been reading when you get a sense of what people are involved with outside of work you can really start to understand a personq anything unusual about the way you manage your timea i make time to wander around a lot because you find out what’s really going on when you pop into people’s offices but i always have a purpose it might be what are the new ideas you’re thinking about for driving creativity or innovation if i always ask about new ideas then people will figure i must be interested about innovation in the last year i was
