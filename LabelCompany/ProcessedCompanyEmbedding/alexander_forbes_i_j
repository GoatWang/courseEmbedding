foundation trustees former trustees current trustees contact us our history memorials donations alexander forbes the scientific career of alexander forbes spanned fiftysix years of active research and saw the development of the realm of neurophysiology to which he contributed over  publications as a proper bostonian of his day he could scarcely avoid going to harvard  he graduated in 9  he also received a masters degree in biology from that institution in 9 before undertaking a degree at harvard medical school  by the time he received his md in 9 he had been infected with the lure of the research laboratory while he learned the rudiments of electrophysiology with professor g h parker  in his fourth year of studies he was challenged by application of these techniques to problems in inhibition in the central nervous system reflex pathways under the guidance of professor walter b cannon after forbes graduated dr cannon immediately offered him the position of instructor in physiology but further suggested he go to liverpool to work with sir charles sherrington for two years   in england forbes also spent a short time with keith lucas and e d adrian in cambridge while they were pioneering the biophysics of peripheral nerve forbes returned to harvard medical school armed with a sherrington guillotine and a lucas pendulum  and a mind prepared to attempt the process of grafting the precise biophysical techniques of peripheral nerve studies to the relatively complex reflexes studies by the sherrington school   with alan gregg he proceeded to develop electrical recordings of the myographic results of flexor reflexes the two papers which resulted demonstrated electrical recordings of central reflex phenomena for the first time    the tool of the time was the string galvanometer forbes had one of the first in new england however the spread of world war i now began to modify everyones plans  forbes who had grown up in a seafaring family was an expert in offshore navigation  he enlisted in the navy  to his surprise instead of going to sea he was assigned to work with a firm called submarine signal corp later to become raytheon where the priority was development of submarine detection devices the classical pingers used on submarine chasers postwar in 9 forbes utilized his electrical experience to develop vacuum tube amplification for the string galvanometer  the result was a fifty fold increase in sensitivity to  uvcm at  hz   this was a remarkable breakthrough   he could now display spike potentials of propagated impulses with significant detail the resulting paper published with thacher in 9 pioneered amplification and recording techniques and provided reliable observations which forbes immediately put to use studying the phenomena of reflex action   another season in england in 9 working with adrian led forbes and adrian to write a paper which demonstrated definitively that cns motor units followed the allornothing principle   forbes followed that the next year with a magnificent review article which established him as master of the new developments in neurophysiology   to understand the significance of being able to state that the cns is made of nerve fibers that have the same properties as peripheral nerve fibers one must remember that the leading theory of inhibition at that time the mcdougall drainage theory of inhibition postulated that  the cns had channels in which nervous energy moved just like water in a pipe with many branches so that if some branches were open there would be drainage from a reservoir of free nervous energy with a consequent inhibition of flow along other channels   forbes further suggested that understanding mechanisms of transmission of nerve to muscle would shed light on the function of central synapses  on the strength of that publication he was promoted from instructor directly to associate professor he would become full professor in 9 in subsequent years forbes went on to develop the idea that reverberating circuits and delay paths explain to a considerable extent prolonged excitatory responses he also had the correct idea on muscle tonus postulating that prolonged contraction was due to motor neurons firing at slow frequencies  these ideas were later verified by ongoing studies by dennybrown adrian and bronk when better techniques became available  another classic paper was published in 9 with renshaw and morison on the analysis of field potentials in the cns  although physiology was his mainstream dr forbes was also accomplished at sailing figure skating skiing and riding  he piloted his own airplane and grumbled good naturedly when forced to relinquish night flying certification after his seventieth birthday  this latter avocation had led him to spend summers in the midthirties perfecting the techniques of taking oblique photograms from the cockpit of a small airplane while he mapped the uncharted coast of labrador  as world war ii approached although close to  years of age he again enlisted in the navy to avail the military of his wealth of geographical knowledge of the northern atlantic coast  his expertise was vital to the selection of sites for airstrips in labrador expediting the transfer of fighter planes from north america to europe when dr forbes became emeritus professor in 9 he moved from the harvard medical school to the harvard biological laboratories in cambridge massachusetts there he and george wald pursued studies on the comparative physiology of color vision in laboratory space made available by dr john welsh  their work helped to establish that three separate pigments in the retina of the eye are involved in perception of color alexander forbes died in 9 at the age of eightythree  dr forbes is remembered as a man of enormous accomplishment and a rare zest and enthusiasm for life as one of the founding trustees of the grass foundation he endowed that organization with a love for the adventure of new ideas a priority for assisting young investigators and a program focus to direct its resources to the growth of neurophysiology  because he was a lifelong neighbor of mbl and collaborator and friend of many of the early mbl community the grass foundation has named these two annual lectures as an ongoing memorial july 9    alexander forbes memorial  harvard university
