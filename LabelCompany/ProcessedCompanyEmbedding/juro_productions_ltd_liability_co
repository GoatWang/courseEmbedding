llc is that it is a form of business entity that limits the liability of its owners while allowing flexibility in operation and management and passing through its income to its members with no tax at the entity level well thats a pretty easy definition of an llc but it leaves a lot of queations unanswered so really what is a limited liability company basic features of an llc the basic features of a limited liability company are its owners have limited liability for the entitys debts and obligations similar to the status of shareholders in a corporation and its income and losses are normally passed through to the owners as if it were a partnership the llc is probably most like a limited partnership but without the requirement that there be at least one general partner liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership an llc is a statutory creation that is unlike general partnerships which developed under common law an llc like a corporation is created by filing a document usually called articles of organization with an officer designated by state law as the llc is a statutory entity the laws governing the llc set up a particular ramework of rules for the operation and management of the llc generally most of the statutory rules are considered to be fallback provisions which take effect only if the llcs operating agreement doesnt provide for guidance on a particular point the llc  a newcomer the llc is a relatively new business entity at least in the united states business entities that bear strong similarities to limited liability companies existed in some european countries but the first modern llc statute in the united states was adopted by the wyoming legislature in  at first the novel entity was slow to gain acceptance the second state to enact a limited liability company act was florida in  five years after wyomings act however in the s the popularity of the llc snowballed and by  every state and the district of columbia had passed statutes allowing the formation of limited liability companies related articles llc advantages llc disadvantages llc vs s corporation llc vs corporation llc vs partnership llc vs limited partnership llc filing

center sign up for our newsletter forms of business organization provided by the missouri small business and technology development centers one of the first decisions that you will have to make as a business owner is how the business should be structured  all businesses must adopt some legal configuration that defines the rights and liabilities of participants in the business’s ownership control personal liability life span and financial structure  this decision will have longterm implications so you may want to consult with an accountant and attorney to help you select the form of ownership that is right for you  in making a choice you will want to take into account the following •your vision regarding the size and nature of your business •the level of control you wish to have •the level of “structure” you are willing to deal with •the business’s vulnerability to lawsuits •tax implications of the different organizational structures •expected profit or loss of the business •whether or not you need to reinvest earnings into the business •your need for access to cash out of the business for yourself an overview of the four basic legal forms of organization sole proprietorship partnerships corporations and limited liability company follows sole proprietorship the vast majority of small businesses start out as sole proprietorships  these firms are owned by one person usually the individual who has daytoday responsibility for running the business  sole proprietorships own all the assets of the business and the profits generated by it  they also assume complete responsibility for any of its liabilities or debts  in the eyes of the law and the public you are one in the same with the business advantages of a sole proprietorship • easiest and least expensive form of ownership to organize • sole proprietors are in complete control and within the parameters of the law may make decisions as they see fit • profits from the business flowthrough directly to the owner’s personal tax return • the business is easy to dissolve if desired disadvantages of a sole proprietorship • sole proprietors have unlimited liability and are legally responsible for all debts against the business  their business and personal assets are at risk • may be at a disadvantage in raising funds and are often limited to using funds from personal savings or consumer loans • may have a hard time attracting highcaliber employees or those that are motivated by the opportunity to own a part of the business • some employee benefits such as owner’s medical insurance premiums are not directly deductible from business income only partially as an adjustment to income partnerships in a partnership two or more people share ownership of a single business  like proprietorships the law does not distinguish between the business and its owners  the partners should have a legal agreement that sets forth how decisions will be made profits will be shared disputes will be resolved how future partners will be admitted to the partnership how partners can be bought out or what steps will be taken to dissolve the partnership when needed yes its hard to think about a “breakup” when the business is just getting started but many partnerships split up at crisis times and unless there is a defined process there will be even greater problems  they also must decide up front how much time and capital each will contribute etc advantages of a partnership • partnerships are relatively easy to establish however time should be invested in developing the partnership agreement • with more than one owner the ability to raise funds may be increased • the profits from the business flow directly through to the partners’ personal tax return • prospective employees may be attracted to the business if given the incentive to become a partner • the business usually will benefit from partners who have complementary skills disadvantages of a partnership • partners are jointly and individually liable for the actions of the other partners • profits must be shared with others • since decisions are shared disagreements can occur • some employee benefits are not deductible from business income on tax returns • the partnership may have a limited life it may end upon the withdrawal or death of a partner types of partnerships that should be considered  general partnership partners divide responsibility for management and liability as well as the shares of profit or loss according to their internal agreement  equal shares are assumed unless there is a written agreement that states differently  limited partnership and partnership with limited liability “limited” means that most of the partners have limited liability to the extent of their investment as well as limited input regarding management decision which generally encourages investors for short term projects or for investing in capital assets  this form of ownership is not often used for operating retail or service businesses  forming a limited partnership is more complex and formal than that of a general partnership  joint venture acts like a general partnership but is clearly for a limited period of time or a single project  if the partners in a joint venture repeat the activity they will be recognized as an ongoing partnership and will have to file as such and distribute accumulated partnership assets upon dissolution of the entity   corporations a corporation chartered by the state in which it is headquartered is considered by law to be a unique entity separate and apart from those who own it  a corporation can be taxed it can be sued it can enter into contractual agreements  the owners of a corporation are its shareholders  the shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the major policies and decisions  the corporation has a life of its own and does not dissolve when ownership changes advantages of a corporation • shareholders have limited liability for the corporation’s debts or judgments against the corporation • generally shareholders can only be held accountable for their investment in stock of the company  note however that officers can be held personally liable for their actions such as the failure to withhold and pay employment taxes • corporations can raise additional funds through the sale of stock • a corporation may deduct the cost of benefits it provides to officers and employees • can elect s corporation status if certain requirements are met  this election enables company to be taxed similar to a partnership disadvantages of a corporation • the process of incorporation requires more time and money than other forms of organization • corporations are monitored by federal state and some local agencies and as a result may have more paperwork to comply with regulations • incorporating may result in higher overall taxes  dividends paid to shareholders are not deductible from business income thus this income can be taxed twice subchapter s corporation a tax election only this election enables the shareholder to treat the earnings and profits as distributions and have them pass through directly to their personal tax return  the catch here is that the shareholder if working for the company and if there is a profit must pay hisherself wages and it must meet standards of “reasonable compensation”  this can vary by geographical region as well as occupation but the basic rule is to pay yourself what you would have to pay someone to do your job as long as there is enough profit  if you do not do this the irs can reclassify all of the earnings and profit as wages and you will be liable for all of the payroll taxes on the total amount limited liability company llc the llc is a relatively new type of hybrid business structure that is now permissible in most states  it is designed to provide limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership  formation is more complex and formal than that of a general partnership the owners are members and the duration of the llc is usually determined when the organization papers are filed  the time limit can be continued if desired by a vote of the members at the time of expiration  llc’s must not have more than two of the four characteristics that define corporations  limited liability to the extent of assets continuity of life centralization of management and free transferability of ownership interests federal tax forms for llc taxed as a partnership in most cases corporation forms must be used if there are more than  of the  corporate characteristics as described above in summary deciding the form of ownership that best suits your business venture should be given careful consideration  use

manager assistant account manager office assistant support client services  hour claims certificate monitoring issue a certificate blog awards giving back news insurance requirements for suppliers and vendorsposted on september     comments  by swingle collinsmost retail wholesale and manufacturing businesses permit suppliers and vendors to deliver products to their premises perhaps even directly to the sales area these businesses may have question like this “i want to be sure our suppliers and vendors are properly insured before they deliver products to us or their employees visit our premises i also want to be sure we have limited our company’s liability as much as possible when we sell use or distribute their products what kinds of insurance should we require and what documentation is needed to accomplish these goals” first consult with your attorney to review your current vendorsupplier agreements or draft new ones many of the issues involved in this question require drafting an agreement that protects you with indemnification or holdharmless and waiver of subrogation provisions as well as requiring specific types of insurance the vendorsupplier must carry before they can do business with you in addition a properlydrafted agreement will indicate what the vendorsupplier must furnish to you as evidence that they are complying with the indemnification and insurance requirements this is typically accomplished by requiring a certificate of insurance from their insurance company or agent your agent will be happy to discuss these requirements with your attorney here are some specific points you and your attorney should consider commercial general liability insurance the suppliervendor should already be covered by a commercial general liability cgl insurance policy this type of policy protects them in case of an accident involving their premises operations and products your agreement should require evidence that this policy provides the following limits of liability limits of  per occurrence and  aggregate are common limits carried on cgl policies these should be the minimum limits you require your company as additional insured adding your company as an additional insured to the suppliervendor’s cgl policy normally requires a special endorsement to the policy there are different kinds of additional insured endorsements so you should specify what kinds you require waiver of subrogation if an employee of the vendorsupplier injures someone or damages property while delivering product to your premises you want to be sure the vendorsupplier’s insurance company can’t sue you to recover any amounts they pay to settle the claim your agreement should require a “waiver of subrogation” to prevent this from happening and the vendorsupplier should provide evidence that their insurance company has agreed to the waiver contractual liability in most cases the cgl policy carried by the vendorsupplier covers the indemnification or hold harmless provision in your agreement but you want to be sure the insurance company has not restricted the coverage in an unacceptable way your agreement with the vendorsupplier should clearly state that such modifications are not acceptable automobile liability insurance you want to be sure the vendorsupplier is adequately protected for accidents involving their vehicles while delivering products to you the liability coverage on their auto policy covers your company as an additional insured automatically you should require evidence of auto liability with a minimum limit of  workers compensation if an employee of the vendorsupplier is injured while delivering product to your premises you want to be sure the suppliervendor carries workers compensation insurance to cover the employee’s medical bills and lost wages the employee is much less likely to sue your company if he or she is compensated by workers compensation insurance in addition you want to be sure the vendorsupplier’s insurance company can’t sue you to recover any amounts they pay to settle the claim your agreement should require a “waiver of subrogation” on the workers compensation policy to prevent this from happening and the vendorsupplier should provide evidence that their insurance company has agreed to the waiver certificates of insurance what kind of evidence should you require to be sure the vendorsupplier has the insurance required by your agreement the typical document is a “certificate of insurance” your agreement should require the vendorsupplier to furnish a certificate of insurance prior to commencing work for your company and again when submitting an invoice for payment reviewing the certificates and other documents furnished by your suppliers and vendors and analyzing them to be sure they are in compliance with your requirements can be a really big job if it’s going to be done correctly with assurance that compliance has indeed been accomplished the job requires someone who is familiar with insurance policies and the nuances of coverage issues and it requires someone who can communicate those issues clearly to the vendorsupplier or their insurance

independent producer say im gonna put you in my llc kid today you just might risky and independent independent producers still exist in hollywood but their numbers are far smaller their work is both limited and risky they must compete with integrated media giants that can bear risk by spreading costs over a number of products the independent producer develops and ultimately makes far fewer shows spreading economic risk over a smaller number of projects even so studios and independent producers are still intertwined the studio buys a finished product from a producer these deals are often negotiated before a film completes and payment is made on delivery these types of agreements sometimes called negative pick up agreements are good for producers because they keep them in business and independent the independent company still bears the risk that a project will not be completed or will incur serious financial loss to reduce risk and enhance control independent producers began to form llcs around productions producing an llc the llc or limited liability company is an entity that essentially contains investor liability within the bounds of the llc itself unlike a partnership the investor in an llc is liable only for the amount of his or her investment in that company so if a hypothetical llc were to go from being in the black to being far far in the red the individual investors are not personally liable for the debts of the llc for companies that operate as partnerships between founders it is useful to form an llc around an individual production in order to prevent any losses incurred from that production from impacting either the partnership as a whole or the assets of the individual partners critics may wonder why not form a corporation around the production and limit liability that way while it is true that a corporation offers similar protection for individual assets llcs have some other unique features that make them the preferred entity for individual productions unlike corporations llcs are not subject to double taxation at both the shareholder and company level instead llcs are taxed as partnerships this gives more flexibility in the way that they allocate gains and losses a critically important feature for entertainment companies whose gains and losses may vary wildly depending on the success of any given project at a particular moment in time llcs offer an additional feature that makes them more flexible and more desirable for use in the entertainment industry they are not subject to governance rules because they are not hemmed in by legal requirements that dictate the manner and mode of governance and organization an llc may be run as the controlling parties desire meaning that no board meetings or shareholder accountings are mandated this gives the company operating the llc the ability to make quick decisions which is highly desirable in a business where time is money     new businesses new taxes of course llcs are not without certain drawbacks among the most notable is the recent california tax change that subjects llcs to a hefty tax some guess this tax was created in order to exact more funds from southern californias dominant industry film whatever the reasons llcs are now more expensive to form and maintain than they have been in the past yet for many companies engaged in the often speculative business of film and television production an llc is still cheaper than the risk of financial ruin llcs protect company assets to make risky business decisions a little bit safer ready to form an llc
