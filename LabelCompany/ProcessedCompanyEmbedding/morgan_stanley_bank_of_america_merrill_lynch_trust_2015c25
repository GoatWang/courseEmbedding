accounts to boost profit x times times times times finance finance banks investing wall street hedge funds ma insurance venture capital morgan stanley turns to stodgy bank accounts to boost profit thursday  nov    am etreuters shares morgan stanley better known for underwriting bonds than for retail banking plans to offer savings accounts and certificates of deposits next year to wring more profit from its wealth management clients executives told reuters the bank has offered checking accounts and credit cards for years but it is launching more consumer banking products and giving brokers bonuses if clients use them the goal is to win more of the assets that customers keep at rivals such as jpmorgan chase or bank of america right now just  percent of morgan stanleys more than  million wealth management clients actively use its retail banking products adam jeffery  cnbc you shouldnt have to deal with two or three financial institutions said eric heaton president of morgan stanley us banks in an interview with reuters just deal with us morgan stanley has no plans to build retail bank branches and will instead rely on its  brokers to sell the new products the effort may leave it looking a little more like a conventional bank a move that regulators have been encouraging since the crisis its chief rival goldman sachs took a similar step in august when it agreed to buy general electric apital banks online deposit business the move is also likely to boost the bottom line — clients who actively use morgan stanleys banking products hold on average  percent more assets at the firm than those who dont the annual fees that customers pay are often based on a percentage of the clients assets at the firm that fee income tends to be relatively stable over time compared with many investment banking businesses the importance of stable results was driven home for the banks investors last month when it released third quarter earnings that showed revenue in its bond trading business plunging  percent excluding an accounting adjustment that investors often ignore while revenue in its wealth unit which includes brokerage fees interest income and other items fell just  percent morgan stanleys fee income and commissions have been falling since the beginning of  which the bank has made up for by generating more revenue from areas including lending after multibillion dollar trading losses brought morgan stanley uncomfortably close to failure during the financial crisis the bank agreed to buy citigroups smith barney business in pieces starting in  turning its retail brokerage business from being an afterthought into the source of about half the banks revenue goldman by contrast remains much more heavily reliant on bond trading stock underwriting and other traditional investment banking businesses to drive its bottom line investors seem to be siding with goldman sachs now — its shares trade at about  times their book value an accounting measure of their net value while morgan stanleys trade at about their book value lofty goal in addition to fee income banking products offer more deposit funding for morgan stanley which regulators view positively during a financial crisis depositors are less likely than corporate bond investors and other lenders to flee when trouble is brewing in markets or at a bank when rates rise deposit funding is often cheaper than other forms of borrowing morgan stanley now has around  billion of deposits in its bank unit and is aiming to get up to  billion in the next several years to help its effort it has assembled a team of card and payment executives many of who led similar businesses at merrill lynch tom duffy who heads banking services within wealth management says his product development team has more than doubled to around  since he joined the bank in  morgan stanleys overall deposits at around  billion fund a much smaller portion of its balance sheet than most other banks — its deposits equal about  percent of assets compared with more than  percent for both jpmorgan chase and bank of america winning more client assets may not be easy analysts noted its a lofty goal to be the primary bank for every one of their wealth management clients said glenn schorr an analyst with evercore isi but even if the bank wins just a sliver of business from customers morgan stanley will be better off he said some financial advisers also question whether they will be able to push their clients who may prefer to conduct their everyday banking at a traditional bank branch
