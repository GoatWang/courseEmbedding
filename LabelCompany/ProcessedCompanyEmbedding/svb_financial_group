dealing with forwardlooking information which applies equally to statements made in this call in addition some of our discussion may include references to nongaap financial measures information about those measures including reconciliation to gaap measures may be found in our sec filings and in our earnings release we expect the call including qa to last approximately an hour and with that i will turn the call over to greg becker greg becker thanks meghan and thanks everyone for joining us today i’ll start by commenting on the markets and our business overall but first i want to say that we are excited to have our new cfo dan beck on board and i know you are looking forward to hearing from him since we are only a couple months into the transition process mike descheneaux our president who is also with us may chime in on certain topics during qa as needed and with that let’s get started we had a strong quarter with record earnings per share of  and record net income of  million and more than  increase over the first quarter and more than  increase over the same quarter last year these results reflect the impact of the shortterm rates and on our earning base solid credit performance and healthy levels of activity among our clients highlights of our second quarter included net interest income growth of  total client funds growth of  a provision for credit losses of  million return on equity of  and return on assets of  expense growth of  and we also received a final fiveyear extension for volcker rule compliance on our covered funds let me start with our target markets the innovation ecosystem and venture capital as a key part of that is doing well overall with healthy transaction levels and ample capital for good companies vcs raised  billion in the second quarter versus  billion last quarter that reflects strong fund raising for first time funds as well as proven fund managers yeartodate it appears vcs are on pace to raise more capital in  than in  which was the biggest year in a decade on top of that venture capital firms are sitting on record levels of uninvested capital and are motivated to put that capital to work venture investing overall increased  quarteroverquarter to nearly  billion and also appears to be on pace to exceed  levels the underlying investment data suggests that the decline in angel one ph seed stage investing is due to company’s bootstrapping or stretching current capital realms overall entrepreneurship and new company formation are alive and well our levels of new client activity support this with the vc markets our challenge is in exits the vcbacked exits declined quarteroverquarter due to lower levels of ma both in terms of overall dollars and the number of deals ipos were relatively bright spot in this recovering from their  lows with  us vcbacked ipos in the second quarter alone compared to  for all of    of those ipos were svb clients based on the numbers yeartodate  ipos appear to be poised to surpass  while the number of ipos has increased recent ipo performance has been disappointing and the momentum needed to spur more ipos has not materialized for now caution for private company valuations and uncertainty about the prospects for future health care tax regulatory reform seem to have put public market investors in a wait and see mode despite a growing pipeline of potential public offerings that said we continue to see healthy activity among our clients we added more than  new core commercial clients in the second quarter a higher pace than usual we are seeing growth across all client segments in all our geographies particularly in early stage private equity global and the private bank our net client growth rate in the second quarter was the highest it’s been in six quarters deal flow has been good across most sectors with private equity again being the strongest about a third of our loan growth related to private equity is coming from new client wins we expect private equity to remain a strong and resilient source of growth over time given that diversity of sub sectors represented and the ability of pe firms to thrive under varying market conditions with regard to our technology and life science portfolios early stage client wins continue to dominate our new client numbers but activity is healthy in other areas as well we’re winning new corporate finance clients at a higher pace and we’re improving our ability to engage these clients to encourage them to fully leverage svb platform among our growth stage clients deal flow has picked up in the first half of  with our strongest ever for newly booked commitments in this segment despite new activity the high pace of ma among our growth and corporate finance clients and significant amounts of new liquidity have been continued headwinds to a faster pace of loan growth yeartodate as a result we’re slightly decreasing our outlook for  loan growth nevertheless our healthy pace of new client wins and new bookings suggest underlying trends remain strong and we believe loan growth among our tech and life science clients will improve in the second half of the year looking at the quarter the rest of  and beyond we’re optimistic about our business momentum we’re seeing significant benefit from recent rate increases consistent with our expectations for asset sensitivity client funds are growing at a tremendous pace due to our highly effective client acquisition engine which has been even more successful due to our efforts to expand our client funnel fee income is healthy and volumes are growing even though we’re seeing some pricing compression our markets are expanding as our efforts to support our clients and partners globally we have applications underway in canada and germany as well as the new investments to support our positive momentum in the uk domestically  we’ve recently expanded our offices in new york and have plans to expand in san francisco to accommodate our growth and the opportunity in those thriving entrepreneurial markets as i noted at the beginning of my comments our expenses increased more than expected in the second quarter and we raised our outlook for expense growth as a result part of it is incentive compensation related to our roe performance and our improved bottom line outlook the rest of it is to support growth we are a growing company this is what it takes to support that growth and continue to build on momentum even as we work to strike optimal balance between investing in growth and being efficient we’re enhancing partnerships onboarding processes and operational support to expand the client funnel i talked about and make sure we remain at the center of the early stage ecosystem we’re spending on new initiatives products and enhancing the client experience including the talent required to lead and implement these initiatives we’re taking steps to boost our fee income growth and putting our credit card penetration making sure our global clients are taking advantage of our foreign exchange products getting the right off balance sheet products and ensuring we’re providing clients with access to our products early in their life cycle and we’re investing in all areas of risk management to support our growth higher requirements related to compliance and preparation for ccar and hence prudential standards our growth requires systemic efforts to drive our operating leverage and a reduction in our expense growth rates as a result we’re focused on a variety of opportunities to simplify and consolidate systems reduce manual process and deploy enabling technology looking ahead our record results and our momentum as we enter the second half of the year are solid and we remain positive about our markets our growth plans and our ability to execute on those our clients are raising capital they’re getting funding and they’re performing well overall they’re doing all this despite anxiety over the situation of washington lower early stage investments and underperforming exit markets likewise svb is delivering strong growth we’re investing in our business and maintaining solid asset quality we’re doing this despite intense competition and madriven turnover in our loan book we believe our success comes from our focus on things that we excel at which are building maintaining lifelong relationships with companies investors and entrepreneurs leveraging our unique knowledge networks and insights to help our clients succeed and being the best partner to innovators entrepreneurs and our investors around the world ultimately we believe the growing innovation industry and the convergence of tech and nontech is going to lead the significant new opportunities in our target markets we’ll continue to manage our business for the longterm so that we can be a critical part of it and now i’d like to turn the call over to our cfo dan beck dan beck thank you greg good afternoon it’s great to be here and to join this exceptional team we delivered a good quarter with strong increase in net income due to health revenue growth and continued stable credit performance while expense growth remains an area of focus highlights of the quarter included one strong growth in net interest income driven by higher interest rates and a larger balance sheet two stable credit with notable improvements in underlying trends three strong capital and liquidity four improved warrant gains related to valuation increases five solid core fee income growth driven by client investment fees albeit somewhat below our expectations and six higher expenses related to higher people costs including incentive compensation infrastructure and operational costs along with risk and compliance related expenses overall we continue to see healthy growth and positive momentum in our pipe line i’ll walk you through some specifics and discuss the few changes to our full year outlook let me start with the balance sheet where we see healthy growth overall average loans increased by  million or  to  billion driven by private equity and the private bank the pace of ma among our clients which included some large deals in the second quarter the abundance of liquidity in our ecosystem and heavy vc investment are constraining faster loan growth for now especially in the technology and life sciences portfolio however as greg pointed out new loan commitments are strong and our pipeline looks stood so we feel positive about our loan growth opportunities moving forward based on our balances at midyear we’re trimming our full year  loan growth outlook from the high teens to the mid teens this amounts to a reduction of approximately  million turning to client funds average total client funds grew by  billion or  to  billion this increase reflected strong average deposit growth of  billion or  driven by robust new client acquisition and healthy equity funding for our clients these trends and the significant amounts of dry powder available for investment suggest deposit growth will remain strong as a result we’re raising our full year deposit growth guidance from the mid single digits to the high single digits average off balance sheet client investment funds also grew strongly by  billion or  due to strong equity funding for investor backed clients and active secondary public offerings among our larger life science clients despite the slow recovery of the ipo markets secondary public offerings remained a robust source of liquidity average assets increased  billion or  to  billion we crossed the  billion asset level for two days during the quarter and expect to reach the threshold that requires sifi compliance by early  which would make us subject to public ccar reporting in early  moving to capital capital on liquidity remains strong tier  leverage ratios at the bank and holding company remained well within our target ranges despite a modest decline at the bank level driven by strong deposit growth and dividend form the bank to the holding company now i would like to turn to the income statement net interest income grew strongly by  million or  to  million driven mainly by the benefit of the december and march fed funds increases and increasing balances on both loans and investment securities as well as one extra day in the quarter in total we had increases of  million in interest on loans  million in cash and investment securities interest income and  million in loan fees mostly from early repayments total yields increased by  basis points which primarily reflected the impact of shortterm rate increases as we discussed last quarter we are seeing approximately  to  of each increase in fed funds translate to improvement in loan yields we also saw a small increase of our deposit cost of  basis points in the quarter higher shortterm interest rates drove an increase of  basis points in our net interest margin to  consistent with our expectations we are raising our full year  outlook for net interest income growth from the high teens to a range of the high teens to low s this accounts for the expected full impact of the march and june rate increases along with the higher investment in cash balances due to robust deposit growth this does not include any future rate increases likewise we are refining our expectations for our net interest margin towards the top half of our previous range we now expect net interest margin to be between  and  now i would like to turn to credit quality which was stable with a number of notable improvements in the quarter our allowance for loan losses was  million at the end of the second quarter or  of total gross loans a decrease of  million or  basis points compared to the first quarter reflective of a decrease in reserves for nonperforming loans as well as improved overall credit quality in our performing loan portfolio our provision for credit losses was  million compared to the  million in the first quarter this consisted of a provision for loan losses to  million the provision for loan losses reflects  million and specific reserves for net new nonaccrual loans and  million for loan growth offset by a  million benefit related to the continued increase in capital call lines and lower criticized loan balances net chargeoffs increased by  million to  million or  basis points of total average loans this figure reflects gross chargeoffs of  million including two loans to software clients totaling  million with the rest primarily from early stage software and life science companies  of net chargeoffs had prior reserves nonaccrual loans decreased by  million to  million or  basis points of total loans this decrease reflects chargeoffs of  million and repayments of  million new nonperforming loans of  million were primarily from companies in our software portfolio and represent a substantial drop from prior quarters while liquidity and valuation still pose a risk for early stage credits we’re seeing good overall performance across the portfolio and solid trends in underlying credit metrics we’re maintaining our full year credit outlook for  now i’d like to turn to noninterest income which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and private equity and venture capital related investments gaap noninterest income was  million up  million or  over the first quarter nongaap noninterest income net of noncontrolling interest was  million an increase of  million or  over the first quarter increase was primarily related to better warrant gains and an increase in core fee income due to higher client investment fees let me review the components equity warrant gains were  million in the second quarter up  million or  these were driven primarily by valuation increases from new funding rounds which are unrealized gains this compares to gains of  million in the first quarter primarily due to realized gains from ma activities nongaap net gains on investment securities net of noncontrolling interests were  million a decline of  million or  from the first quarter this reflects approximately  million of distribution from our strategic investments and  million of valuation increases associated with our managed funds of funds moving to core fee income overall we’re seeing growth from strong volumes with some price compression core fee income increased  million or  to  million primarily driven by higher client investment fees client investment fees increased by  million or  to  million due to higher spreads and an additional  billion in offbalance sheet client fund balances credit card fees were roughly flat at  million this is an area where we’re seeing higher client penetration and transaction volumes offset by lower spreads due to competition fees from foreign exchange transactions were also flat at  million which reflects an increase of  in overall transaction volumes offset by lower spreads and lower global currency volatility as a result of pricing pressure on credit card fee income and lower spreads on foreign exchange transactions we’re decreasing our full year  outlook for core fee income growth from the high teens to the mid teens in dollar terms this amounts to a reduction of between  million and  million pretax on an annual basis in our fee income expectations turning to expenses noninterest expense was  million an increase of  million or  taking into consideration seasonal increases of  million in the first quarter noninterest expenses increased by  million or  included in these numbers are approximately  million of expense items that we do not expect to recur as a result we are increasing our full year  expense growth outlook from the low double digit to the low teens to put it into perspective this is an increase of approximately  million to  million pretax on an annual basis half of which is accounted for in the second quarter we expect expenses in the q and q to be relatively consistent with q levels while approximately  million of our q expense increase was for onetime  or for items we do not expect to recur we do not anticipate a corresponded reduction in future quarters due to our plans to add people and infrastructure to build our business and to support our growth again this is considered in our outlook the second quarter increase came from investments and growth enhancing initiatives that greg referred to in his comments with that in mind the increase was primarily attributable to three factors first was higher people related cost of  million excluded the q seasonal expenses mentioned above this was evenly split between staffing and compensation increases to support revenue and growth enhancing initiatives along with incentive compensations related to roe relative to peers due to improving bottom line results included in this figure are approximately  million of nonrecurring items i would like to point out that we’ve reached the ceiling on our peerrelated roe incentive compensation for the year the second category was infrastructure and operationally oriented investments totaling  million in business development projects systems and technology to support our continued strong growth and related initiatives as well as other operating costs of this amount approximately  million relates to items that are not expected to recur the third category was investments of approximately  million in enhancements to our risk and compliance infrastructure again to support our momentum as we grow into a larger more global organization finally a note on taxes we recognized the  million tax benefit related to new accounting guidance for sharebased compensation that we implemented last quarter this tax benefit equated to approximately  per share as a reminder the magnitude of this tax impact of the employee sharebased transactions is a function of one the vesting date for restricted stock units two the amount of in the money stock options that are exercised and three the change in our stock price relative to the grant date values of the sharebased compensation awards i would like to point out that the tax benefits are expected to be lower in the second half of  in closing we are pleased with our performance this quarter we delivered record earnings strong balance sheet growth and solid credit quality capital and liquidity remain strong to support our continued growth we are wining new clients at a rapid pace and continue to see healthy deal activity backed by a solid pipeline despite persistent competition and elevated ma activity among our clients our clients are performing well overall and are able to access funding and liquidity as evidenced by our robust deposit franchise we remain focused on expanding our clients’ asset base penetration product offering and global footprint while delivering highquality growth and stable credit quality and lastly we continue to invest prudently to enhance our infrastructure to support our growth and meet increasing regulatory requirements thank you and i’ll ask the operator to open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from ken zerbe from morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe i guess maybe a question for dan just in terms of  if i heard your sifi comments correctly i think you said that you plan to cross over or sort of be eligible if you will in the first part of  i just want to make sure i understand the process and everything correctly because i have your  billion plus in total assets currently and i certainly have you crossing over  billion well on the fourquarter trailing basis well before  can you just walk us through sort of what am i missing here why don’t you cross over on fourquarter average earlier than early  thanks dan beck it’s a great question that calculation is based on our end of period asset figures as we report in our regulatory filing we don’t expect to reach the fourquarter average of that end up period amount until we get to the second quarter of  so it’s really reflective of that fourquarter average and our predictions at this point that we’ll be there by the second quarter of  greg becker yes clarified the  ken zerbe sorry just to be super clear fourquarter rolling look back  months look back is fourth quarter sorry  second quarter of  dan beck second quarter of  ken zerbe got it okay and then that’s when you are eligible in  and then you have to file ccar in  dan beck you are right yes ken zerbe okay that makes sense and then second question just in terms of the expenses i get that you did have some of the onetime items in there but how much of your spending currently does go towards ccar preparation versus other items i’m just wondering how much more of the ccar prep that we need to be thinking about dan beck when we look at the increase in expenses that we talked about in our outlook included in our guidance we don’t have a significant increase in the ccar expenses we are spending roughly  million to  million a year on ccar and the thing that that is going to get us to the right level in  as we look ahead to  we have been increasing that amount by  million to  million a year and we think that that will probably get us there on the ccar related expenses greg becker this is greg the only thing i would add to that is that it’s more where you can tangibly connect it to ccar sifi and hence potential standards but there are clearly other areas in the organization in areas of risk that we still have to raise our gain now how much of that relates to ccar or sifi versus just prudent risk management and the bar being raised it’s hard to distinguish but we have more money obviously that we are going to be putting into the infrastructure and risk management as well operator and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim poonawala thanks good afternoon guys i just wanted to touch based on the fee revenue outlook i guess the guidance there has bumped a little bit over the last few quarters just wanted to get your sort of big picture thoughts greg in terms of where have you seen some of the biggest delta operationally in the first six months relative to when we started out the year was it lower forex fees and why lower card fees and why  any color would be extremely helpful greg becker sure i will start and dan or others may want to add into it but i’d break it down into two buckets and the areas you described it is fx and it is cards i will start with fx to think about fx the volumes remain strong and there is really kind of a couple of components to saying why wouldn’t the revenue follow that so one is there are some larger transactions in there and larger transactions on the spot trades so they have lower margins that’s number one number two you have lower volatility in the fx markets and where that’s impacted actually relates to forwards and options so that’s a higher margin business and so since the volatility is down you tend to have the net overall lower fx revenue despite the volumes being up so we don’t know obviously where volatility will play out in the second half of the year but that was the main driver and so we’re expecting more of a consistent growth from volumes and some margin improvement but we’re not expecting volatility to come back if it does come back we’ll see some upside in fx that’s one piece second piece is on the cards again much like fx we’ve seen very nice volume growth the margins impacted for a few different areas one is mixed but i’ll give you an example where margin compressions come down and it’s not in our control so our clients as you would expect have a lot of credit card purchases for google ads and facebook ads what happens is google and facebook work with mastercard and visa to negotiate lower interchange fees because of the volumes going through what happens we get impacted more than other players because more of our clients are spending on those ads so that actually creates some compression and interchange in margin related specifically to our clients now we can’t predict those are the areas that will occur those are the two biggest ones and we believe that probably ph negotiated longer term arrangements for that so we think the margins will stabilize and the volumes will pick up so we expect to see some growth in the latter half of the year which is built into our outlook so that  but you do see that interchange coming down that was the main driver so volume is good some impact on the margin ebrahim poonawala how big of a component in your growth outlook is adding new clients for both these services or is it mostly activity levels times margin and that’s what the growth is greg becker yes and there is two different pieces right so one was on fx fx is  it’s mainly selling to our existing clients including some new with the private equity et cetera but it’s mainly to existing clients and it is penetration right so we still have more penetration of our existing clients where we have clients that are sending international wires then they are sending it us dollars and the transactions being traded on fx on the opposite side we believe we can provide our clients a better service and actually at lower price in the fx if it’s traded on the front end so there is an opportunity there to continue to growth with existing clients with credit cards again it’s penetration related so we have more upside there and then that is an area where you do have sometimes some larger new clients where that actually does create a material bump on a companybycompany basis but i’d say if you broke the two apart the majority is going to come from existing client penetration ebrahim poonawala understood and just switching gears in terms of competition on lending i got the color what you talked about in terms of what drove slower loan growth for the quarter but there is a fair chatter post just last quarter’s earnings around pricing competition i think loan spreads just wanted to get some color in terms of how competition stacks up today versus three or six months ago and incrementally as we think about the june rate hike and maybe another rate hike in december is your expectation that the sensitivity of the margin to every future rate hikes should be similar to what we’ve seen so far this cycle greg becker yes i’ll start ebrahim and then marc may want to add something i’ll start with the last question first which is what do we expect in the future i’d say generally speaking we would expect that same margin sharing to occur which is roughly  to  of rate increases would be brought down you have a mix question though right so we continue to grow lower margin loans but so you have to take that into consideration but the net number  to  is right now just competition in general it is competitive it’s a very competitive we’re seeing it from both banks and nonbanks i would say slightly more competitive than it was but it’s not a dramatic change it’s how i would describe it much like we’ve talked about in prior quarters there is three different ways to look at competition you can look at pricing you can look at size of loans and you can look at structure we look at the deal we look at the overall risk and we may be willing to drop pricing a little bit depending upon how quality it is we may be willing to do a larger loan if it has structure where we see again some pressure is the structure as well and that’s an area we really want to be disciplined on mike has talked in the past about smart growth we would put it in the smart growth category that being said the one last point i’d make is we as i described had a very strong pipeline we had very strong level of booked commitments and our hope is that we’ll give guidance or give future loan growth in the second half of the year so with that i’ll pause and see marc if you have anything to add marc cadieux no you covered it operator and our next question comes from jennifer demba from suntrust robinson please go ahead jennifer demba ebrahim pretty much just covered my question but could you just go into as much color as you can on the reasons for the tampering the loan growth outlook for the rest of the year greg becker yes jennifer i’ll start and it is mainly driven because of what we saw in the first and the second quarter because you’re talking to deal with averages and so if you see that being lower than what we thought obviously that plays out for the balance of the year number one number two we do look at it and say despite what i said we do believe the second half will be stronger than the first half especially in the tech and second life science portfolio we still believe it’s going to be very competitive and we still believe we’re going to have to be smart about where we do want to lean in and where we want to back away so i wouldn’t read anything into it more than that operator and our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw just on the expense side when you spoke about the  million incremental growth in expenses quarteroverquarter compensation did i hear you right that a third of that is roughly call it revenue producing personnel a third is support and a third is due to the roe adjustment was that correct dan beck it’s generally correct if we look at it we get the  million worth of increase  million of that is nonrecurring items a half of that relates to the roe plans as well as some other onetime items related to benefit cost so rest the  is really people related and growth related people cost jared shaw and then on the  looking at third quarter with the expectation  third and fourth quarter with the expectation that expenses are flat where else  so that  million is not recurring it’s going to be distributed in other categories is that still going to be increased hiring or should we expect to see is it professional services as you are ramping up maybe new systems maybe just a little color on where that  million gets reallocated greg becker this is greg jared it’s going to be across the board it is going to be in additional hiring and again go back to the fact that whether it is expanding into different markets supporting our growth so we are adding people in a variety of different areas number one number two it is about systems and infrastructure as i talked about we do have to make investments in that area and it will be frontend loaded and quite honestly we will be seeing that for a while where we have to invest in systems to improve the manual processes and procedures that we do have and so you will see it in a variety of areas but we try to give you enough color to give you a little more clarity on expectations on absolute numbers in the third and the fourth quarter which is why dan shared the commentary about we expect third and fourth quarter to be generally in the range on an absolute basis at the level of q jared shaw and then on the investments in these systems ultimately are these more people heavy or is it more software heavy where we should see as we look out maybe in  more operating  positive operating leverage coming from those investments or is it really as the business grows the pace of growth with these new investments have to maintain or keep up with that greg becker i would love to make it a simple answer and say it’s just one area and it’s going to be all about efficiency but there is systems that we have that we’ve had for a while that we just have quite honestly there end of life and we have to upgrade and so there isn’t going to be a material cost savings when those get implemented so the others really are about looking at manual process and procedures whether it’s a client onboarding it’s such a simple one where the way we have it today we have a really great frontend that it makes easy for our clients but the backend side of it is an incredibly manual intensive process we have got to make that automated end to end to create more efficiency so that would be an example of one that would create efficiencies and scalability but there is others that truly are end of life or it just is an area that we just actually need system capabilities that we don’t have today so it’s an incremental add operator and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jp morgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos i want to make sure i fully understand this so if we look at the updated expense outlook is the increased guidance primarily tied to higher incentive comp or since last quarter have you also decided now to accelerate the pace of investment greg becker this is greg steve so it’s a little bit of catch up in the second quarter on incentive compensation and obviously we look it for the whole year and so that incentive compensation will be built in and we’re going to be spending more money on different infrastructure and growth initiatives so it’s a combination of both steven alexopoulos okay got you thank you and then on the total client funds you guys had almost growth ph in total client fund this quarter that you had all last year could you give more color what’s driving this growth do you see more rounds are there larger rounds what is it greg becker yes it’s again variety of different things one is you saw the numbers in the quarter i talked about and it was an incredibly strong quarter for venture capital activity we saw a number of rounds that were pretty amazing the number of  million rounds that were closed was truly astonishing and we’re winning the majority of those client funds a  almost all those dollars are coming to us we had another client that raised in the uk a massive amount of money and again we got the majority of those funds and so it is about large rounds but the second part is about increasing our funnel and adding a lot of new clients so we as i said we had  new core commercial clients and so that was  that is good and the other part is one of the areas we’ve done an offbalance sheet is that we have gone after what i’ll call prospects that they are not clients of ours but they have their larger net excess cash and targeting them to start with actually selling our offbalance sheet product for cash management and then looking at buildings bringing them in as clients so it’s still strategy combined with just very strong market growth market liquidity right now steven alexopoulos got you and i think you partially answered this but if we look at  of the client funds moving of balance sheet i was wondering are you guys pushing that harder given coming up on  billion or are clients preferring that now that rates are higher greg becker we’re not changing our view we’re not pushing clients anyway right now i actually feel that we’ve got a really good balance to our product set and so they are going at the right place they are going to place they should and when you see these large ones rounds get closed those vast majority should be going off balance sheet so i think it’s a good mix right now but short answer is we’re not pushing anyone because we’re getting close to  billion operator and our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead chris mcgratty maybe on the margin guide what’s the assumption that’s being made that related to cash balances which obviously had tremendous growth in the quarter what’s the assumption for deployment in the back half of the year greg becker chris this is greg i’ll start so when you think about the cash balances we’re trying to keep anywhere from  to  billion of cash maybe a little bit more than that and so you’ll see spikes on a given basis that’s why you have period end balances that will be higher but you can look at that now again the rest of it is just the model how much money we have coming off that’s actually being reinvested and dan may have those numbers better than i do but we’re effectively rolling off i want to say it’s roughly  million quarter and so that’s getting reinvested obviously at higher rates than they were at before which is very helpful to the margin dan beck yes just to add to that greg our cash balance guidance is around  million to  million that’s the level that we’ve been operating around and we’re replacing about  million  running off about  million per quarter on the securities portfolio we did add within the quarter because of the increased cash balances close to  billion worth of investment securities at an overall average   around that range so it is a pickup for us on those balances chris mcgratty so just so i got it the new reinvestment rates was  in the quarter is that right dan beck yes chris mcgratty okay in terms of the second half tax rate should we  backing out last two quarters just kind of go back to where it was last year maybe full year is a good proxy for the back half dan beck there is a lot of volatility in that tax rate because it’s driven by exercise on the stock compensation side that being said we expect fewer exercises in q and q and if that happens and we’ll be back to the  rate operator and our next question comes from john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open john pancari just on the expense topic again in terms of the higher incentive comp component i know you indicated that in part it relates to the improving roe however if you look at your roe over the past several years i guess going back to few years there is not a real notable increase and same thing with the roa so i’m just  give us a little bit of color what exactly you’re anchoring that to dan beck so i’ll start and others might jump in what we’re doing is we’re targeting on a portion of our incentive compensation plan our roe relative to peers so a third of our overall incentive compensation plan is driven by that pure benchmarking you’ve seen over the last few quarters and in particular this quarter an improvement in that roe that puts us very close to the top  to  of the pure benchmark in roe for our peer sets so that’s truly driving component of the overall incentive compensation if we take a step back on expenses let’s just look at things from a guidance perspective where we started the year we started the year in the high single digits and now we’re effectively sitting in the low teens what that means to us just overall is anywhere between  million and  million increase in the overall expense outlook on an annualized basis stepping back from there about  million of that relates to improved performance which includes this component of the compensation plan tied to roe so that’s a big driver of the overall number the addition to that is the investments in operations as well as regulatory and compliance area but preponderance of what’s happening here relates to a performance relative  and in particular relative to this roe plan john pancari and then on the risk and compliance investments can you help me out again in terms of on the risk compliance side what investments are these that differ from what you’ve already accomplished as you approach the  billion i know you indicated greg that there is more you can do on that side beyond what you did but can you talk about what is it that the regulators have not yet been on about improving but now it’s the time to do it greg becker we think about it so as we were growing over the last two three four years we continued to invest in a variety of different areas but we continue to add what i’ll call expertise for people that actually have been there and done it and actually managed larger programs and so if you look at our risk functional overall risk includes it includes our compliance department it includes our enterprise wide risk management it includes bsa aml it includes loan review it includes credit review or model risk management all those areas if you look across the board and just look at what i’ll call other institutions and what they are hearing and what feedbacks are getting from the regulators and just our own risk management levels we are having to invest across all those areas and it is both people and its technology and for us this really i would say is less about ccar although i guess part of it would be  it’s more about we just have to up our game as we get bigger as an institution as we become more global as we have more transaction processing all those things so i wouldn’t say it’s one part of risk management it is actually across all areas that we need to raise our game john pancari if i could ask just one more efficiency ratio expectation could you talk about that little bit for  dan beck so as we… greg becker yes so i’ll start so for  usually what we end up talking about is in the october call we start to give guidance out to  and we will do that again i just want to talk about  first dan is going to comment on the balance of  dan beck yes what i was going to say is obviously so much of that is dependent upon rate outlook expectations and there is a lot of variability that goes into that so it’s hard to comment on exactly where things are going to end up but with the improvement  or the increase in june the expectation is that it would be slightly better but again still dependent upon what happens from rate perspective operator and our next question comes from brett rabatin from piper jaffray please go ahead your line is open brett rabatin i wanted to ask a nonexpense question i wanted to ask about credit and if i kind of heard your tone right it sounds like you are maybe a little more comfortable with your outlook even though you haven’t changed the specific guidance around chargeoffs i’m just curious to hear how you see the environment shaping up greg and then does the new guidance around preprofit technology companies does that going to have any effect on how you criticize the asset levels greg becker i’ll start at a high level and then marc will comment on it in more detail q was a really strong quarter from a credit quality perspective and our view is we feel good about that we feel good about the outlook and we think a lot of what we experienced in  as far as the recalibration is behind us that being said we’ve been in this business long enough to know that one quarter is not a trend make and that you end up in a position where we feel good about where we are but we don’t feel that we have the clarity yet to kind of change our guidance so i’ll leave it at that and turn it over to marc marc cadieux yes so i’ll pick up with early stage and so there as greg mentioned following the  what we saw on the first half of  we have now seen four consecutive quarters of what i would characterize as pretty typical credit quality performance in the early stage segment which is reassuring again it’s not necessarily predictive of the future and we do continue to hear companies that are struggling to raise that series b round of financing for example but again our credit quality in early stage segment continues to be stable you referenced new guidance we’ve heard some questions about that i think stemming from the earnings release of another bank we’re unaware and in fact have confirmed that there is no new guidance related to lending to preprofit companies either inter agency or from any of the agencies independently and therefore not expecting any change in credit quality in preprofit driven by regulatory change obviously if there were to be guidance we’d have to incorporate that in our thinking and presumably if we thought it was going to have any impact we’d be talking about it operator and our next question comes geoffrey elliott from autonomous research please go ahead geoffrey elliott i wondered if you could help tie together a couple of things that you said earlier in the prepared remarks at the beginning you talked about the exit environment being tougher less ma taking place specifically but then when you were talking about your client base you mentioned ma as being something which is being negative to loan growth so i am assuming that means some of your clients getting acquired so just curious why you think your client base is different from the industry overall if actually that’s the case greg becker yes this is greg so when you think about the numbers and what people are paying attention to in the market we’re now looking at exit they are talking about the very very large exits that’s what the attention is paid to that’s the headline news when we’re talking about loan balances where you’ve got  million  million  million you are looking at acquisitions that are actually on the lower end and those acquisitions do then retire all the debt that we have typically if a company is being sold for hundreds if not billions of dollars they probably have a lot of cash a lot of liquidity they probably raised a lot of money so kind of borrowing that much at the end of the day so we just  what we say is this is what we’re experiencing the headline news in the market is that ma is on the softer side relative to what it was a year ago but what we’ve experienced we look at pay downs in the second quarter ma clearly was a catalyst for that geoffrey elliott and then in terms of growth on the technology and life sciences and also your healthcare loan book just help us understand what you think that should look like over the next few years do we get back to the pace that we’ve seen in the past or is it going to be slower from now on just given some of the competitive factors you’ve rolled out greg becker yes when i think about  this is greg and marc will probably add some color when i think about the tech and life science portfolio you got couple of things going on one is you do have with a lot of the loan products that we have they amortize and so you start out the day with amortization in a given quarter in a given year that you then have to replace to get back to zero so you get start there the second part then is just liquidity in the market we’re at a point right now where with the high liquidity that we have you have lines of credit that aren’t utilized or they just don’t take that to the same level because they have  million or  million or  million worth of cash on their balance sheet and why would they want to pay for something that’s just adding more cash to that balance sheet they may not need or probably won’t need that being said when we look at the market we view it as still a robust market it’s a growing market our win rate is very strong despite it being competitive and that’s part of the reason that we’re optimistic now what does that look like from a growth rate percentage it’s hard to predict my take if you look out in the future you’re going to be looking at in the single digits mid to high single digit is where i would end up with the volatility on a given quarter and even on a given year depending upon where venture capital flow is and what the level of ma in our client base is operator and our next question comes from aaron deer from sandler o’neill  partners please go ahead aaron deer one of the highlights for quarter was the client investment fees no doubt it’s coming from the large input that you have there but i would imagine you also got a benefit from higher rates in the fees being affected by that can you give us a sense of where those fees stood maybe on a basispoint level at june th relative to march st and what kind of uptick we might get from the rate hikes that were inter quarter greg becker yes we’re roughly  aaron this is greg roughly around  basis points of yield on the overall offbalance sheet management and as you know we were as low as  months ago at roughly  basis points so the rate increases that we’ve seen have allowed us to go to that  basis points and i think just a good rule of thumb  obviously we don’t have this factored into our outlook but a good rule of thumb would be right now given the level that we’re at it’s probably about a basis point per  basis points of increases that you would see out into the future we talked before about maybe being as much as  to  basis points but since we’ve already gone up to  obviously it will start to slow down that growth with future rate increases so rule of thumb  basis point for  basis points of future increases aaron deer okay and then just a quick one on the tax rate and the impact of the share comp looking out to  do you expect based on the timing of the issuances that it’s going to be another kind of frontloaded here in terms of the tax benefit and then that would fade or is it more tied to the price of the stack it seems like  issuances seem to be the bigger driver but you can correct me if i’m wrong dan beck yes issuances as well as where the overall stock price is are the big drivers so we can’t say with certainty what’s going to happen next year but when we look at where our options and where restricted stock vest is more heavily weighted to the front part of the year so obviously it depends on the overall stock price but assuming it would increase it would be more heavily weighted to the front part of the year operator next question comes from chris york from jmp securities chris york so greg you said in your prepared remarks that loan growth was positively affected in the private equity business now i think that loan type is clumped in with vc in the q so could you tell us what the growth was in dollars quarteroverquarter and then maybe what the period end portfolio size is greg becker so i’m going to let marc to give you a little more color on the q the one thing i would say when we took the pes our private equity services it is call loans for both private equity and venture capital and the vast majority of any growth that we see is coming from private equity not from venture capital but marc anymore color you want to add to it marc cadieux yes so loans went up in that broader type of private equity services roughly  million quarteroverquarter this quarter was actually type of what greg said because that is generally a bit anomalous this quarter and that we actually had more growth from vc segment than we did from the pe segment chris york and maybe as a followup so can you remind us of the gotomarket strategy maybe with sponsors as they are raising a lot new money here and then potentially the weighted average yield on your private equity service facilities dan beck so in terms of yields and from interestonly standpoint the venture capital segment of private equity services is around  for interest only yield private equity is a bit less than that in the mid s chris york and then maybe just a little color on the strategy and how sponsors are reacting to the new product  i mean not new but relatively new for you guys dan beck i think you might be confusing between sponsored buyouts perhaps and maybe their private equity capital call lines of credit greg becker so chris the private equity capital calls loans we’ve been doing for ever and now with sponsor led buyouts even that has been around for  now you are looking at almost  years i would say that neither one would that in the category on new but if you  i’ll focus on assuming you are talking about sponsorled buyouts so there have been a lot of new funds raised which is why part of our private equity services business is doing so well we are very targeted we are looking at  and our sponsorled buyout technology mostly software buyout as well as some healthcare services deals so we take the large private equity market and our market target market gets much more narrow our gotomarket is defined the right sponsors the ones that we have worked with or the ones that have built up a good track record that we want to partner with and we are looking at putting in the senior credit facilities for them the strategy hasn’t changed a whole lot i would tell you that it is definitely one area that’s gotten more competitive less so from banks more from nonbanks who have raised a lot of debt funds going to go larger on the structure and size side of the equation operator and our next question comes from matt keating from barclays please go ahead matt keating yes thank you just one quick question on the international operations i am just curious if you are seeing the same levels of more muted growth in the traditional software hardware life sciences practices internationally that you might be overall are you seeing faster growth there than the us at this point in those categories greg becker yes this is greg we’re seeing a little bit faster growth it’s still competitive less so from banks more so from the nonbanks that are out there but because you don’t have  i mean you’re adding newer clients at a faster pace as a percentage of the portfolio you don’t have the same level of turnover and therefore those balances can build more quickly than what you see in the us so we’re seeing nice growth in the global markets i mean uk specifically for tech and life sciences but it is definitely competitive matt keating right and now germany and canada expansion are those still in the works right now and expect to bring those on line over the next couple of years is that a fair timeline greg becker yes obviously i’ll start with subject to regulatory approval we would expect that in the hopefully in the first half of  we’ll be able to start getting some traction in those markets but again just to take a step back either of those markets are going to go from very little base that you’re starting from or no base in one case and you’re going to be building on that so it will take a while how i describe it is you’ve got the core loan growth from the areas that we describe and germany or canada is going to be icing on the cake operator and the next question comes from john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari hi sorry to queue back in i’d one more quick followup you mentioned the roe rationale on your comp and versus peers who is your peer group that you’re talking about greg becker yes i think it’s in our proxy and it’s pretty clearly outlined so i don’t know all the names off the top of my head and i don’t want to spend time on the call going through it but you can look it up on the proxy john pancari that’s what i just wanted to confirm it’s within the proxy okay all right thanks operator and that concludes our questionanswersession i will turn the call now back over to greg becker for final remarks greg becker great thanks so in closing i just want to say thanks to everyone for joining us today when we look at the overall markets that we serve second quarter was a really really strong quarter in fund raising venture funds in investing deployment of capital soft on the exit side but again what we see in our portfolio there is companies that are performing really well so we feel good about again our target market we had a record quarter we’re seeing the benefit after many many years of rising rates coupled with strong fundamentals and feel good that we’ve got a solid outlook for the balance of  so feel really good about where we are really as we always do just want to thank our clients for their trust and support in us we know we have a lot to live up to and totally appreciate their business and thank all our employees for what they do and just have a real strong team here love working with and feel really good about what we’ve built and then finally i want to thank dan beck for joining the team he did a great job on his first inaugural earnings call and great addition to the team so thank you all and have a great day
