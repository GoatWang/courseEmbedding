founded beckman instruments based on his  invention of the ph meter a device for measuring acidity later considered to have revolutionized the study of chemistry and biology he also developed the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience beckman funded the first transistor company thus giving rise to silicon valley after

people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford university stanford california beckman institute california institute of technology pasadena california the beckmans also gave to the arnold and mabel beckman center for the history of chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital in la jolla calif mabel

orville beckman was born in cullom illinois a village of about  people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at

chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital

orville beckman was born in cullom illinois a village of about  people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford university stanford california beckman institute california institute of technology pasadena california the beckmans also gave to the arnold and mabel beckman center for the history of chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital

beckman conference center national academies awards and honorsedit mabel and arnold beckman arnold beckman was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  beckman was inducted into the junior achievement us business hall of fame in  in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in akron ohio in  he received its lifetime achievement award he was inducted into the alpha chi sigma hall of fame in  in  he received a special millennium edition of the othmer gold medal from the chemical heritage foundation in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to chemical and scientific heritage beckman was awarded the national medal of technology in  it is the highest honor the united states can confer to a us citizen for achievements related to technological progress president george h w bush presented beckman with the national medal of science award in  for his leadership in the development of analytical instrumentation and for his deep and abiding

orville beckman was born in cullom illinois a village of about  people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford university stanford california beckman institute california institute of technology pasadena california the beckmans also gave to the arnold and mabel beckman center for the history of chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital

beckman conference center national academies awards and honorsedit mabel and arnold beckman arnold beckman was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  beckman was inducted into the junior achievement us business hall of fame in  in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in akron ohio in  he received its lifetime achievement award he was inducted into the alpha chi sigma hall of fame in  in  he received a special millennium edition of the othmer gold medal from the chemical heritage foundation in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to chemical and scientific heritage beckman was awarded the national medal of technology in  it is the highest honor the united states can confer to a us citizen for achievements related to technological progress president george h w bush presented beckman with the national medal of science award in  for his leadership in the development of analytical instrumentation and for his deep and abiding concern for the vitality of the nations scientific enterprise he had previously been recognized by the reagan administration as one of about  citizens receiving the  presidential citizens medal for

orville beckman was born in cullom illinois a village of about  people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford university stanford california beckman institute california institute of technology pasadena california the beckmans also gave to the arnold and mabel beckman center for the history of chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital

beckman conference center national academies awards and honorsedit mabel and arnold beckman arnold beckman was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  beckman was inducted into the junior achievement us business hall of fame in  in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in akron ohio in  he received its lifetime achievement award he was inducted into the alpha chi sigma hall of fame in  in  he received a special millennium edition of the othmer gold medal from the chemical heritage foundation in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to chemical and scientific heritage beckman was awarded the national medal of technology in  it is the highest honor the united states can confer to a us citizen for achievements related to technological progress president george h w bush presented beckman with the national medal of science award in  for his leadership in the development of analytical instrumentation and for his deep and abiding concern for the vitality of the nations scientific enterprise he had previously been recognized by the reagan administration as one of about  citizens receiving the  presidential citizens medal for exemplary deeds of service beckman was awarded the order of lincoln the state of illinois highest honor by the lincoln academy of illinois in  beckman was awarded the public welfare medal from the

philanthropist while a professor at california institute of technology he founded beckman instruments based on his  invention of the ph meter a device for measuring acidity later considered to have revolutionized the study of chemistry and biology he also developed the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience beckman funded

orville beckman was born in cullom illinois a village of about  people in a farming community he was the youngest son of george beckman a blacksmith and his second wife elizabeth ellen jewkes he was curious about the world from an early age when he was nine beckman found an old chemistry textbook joel dorman steeles fourteen weeks in chemistry and began trying out the experiments his father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory beckmans mother elizabeth died of diabetes in  beckmans father sold his blacksmith shop and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials a housekeeper hattie lange was engaged to look after the beckman children arnold beckman earned money as a practice pianist with a local band and as an official cream tester running a centrifuge for a local store– in  the beckman family moved to normal located just north of bloomington illinois so that the young beckmans could attend university high school in normal a laboratory school associated with illinois state university in  they moved to bloomington itself– but continued to attend university high where arnold beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry howard w adams– while still in high school arnold started his own business bloomington research laboratories doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company– he also performed at night as a moviehouse pianist and played with local dance bands– he graduated valedictorian of his class with an average of  over four years the highest attained beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the first world war effort in early  by working as a chemist at keystone steel and iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon sulfur manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel when beckman turned  in august  he enlisted in the united states marines after three months at marine boot camp on parris island south carolina he was sent to the brooklyn navy yard for transit to the war in europe because of a train delay another unit embarked in place of beckmans unit then counted into groups in the barracks beckman missed being sent to russia by one space in line instead arnold spent thanksgiving at the local ymca where he met yearold mabel stone meinzer who was helping to serve the meal mabel would become his wife a few days later the armistice was signed ending the war university educationedit arnold beckman attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beginning in the fall of  during his freshman year he worked with carl shipp marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury as a result beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry where he worked with worth rodebush t a white and gerhard dietrichson– he earned his bachelors degree in chemical engineering in  and his masters degree in physical chemistry in  for his masters degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions a subject introduced to him by t a white soon after arriving at the university of illinois beckman joined the delta upsilon fraternity he was initiated into zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma the chemistry fraternity in  and the gamma alpha graduate scientific fraternity in december  beckman decided to go to california institute of technology caltech for his doctorate he stayed there for a year before returning to new york to be near his fiancée mabel who was working as a secretary for the equitable life assurance society he found a job with western electrics engineering department the precursor to the bell telephone laboratories working with walter a shewhart beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design it was here that beckman discovered his interest in electronics mabel and arnold beckman beckman married mabel on june   in  the couple moved back to california and beckman resumed his studies at caltech he became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor roscoe g dickinson on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light it worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple converting the incident heat into electricity which drove a galvanometer after receiving a phd in photochemistry in  for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions beckman was asked to stay on at caltech as an instructor and then as a professor linus pauling another of roscoe g dickinsons graduate students was also asked to stay on at caltech in  beckman and his family built a home in altadena california in the foothills and adjacent to pasadena they lived in altadena for over twenty seven years raising their family teaching and consultancy at caltechedit arnold beckmans laboratory at caltech during his time at caltech beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels beckman shared his expertise in glassblowing by teaching classes in the machine shop he also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments beckman dealt firsthand with the chemists need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry departments instrument shop– beckmans interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at caltech as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments over the time that he was at caltech the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry arthur amos noyes head of the chemistry division encouraged both beckman and chemical engineer william lacey to be in contact with realworld engineers and chemists and robert andrews millikan caltechs president referred technical questions to beckman from government and businesses– with their blessing beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant he also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials ph meteredit see also ph meter beckman model m ph meter beckman portable ph meter in use in  millikan referred i h lyons from the national postal meter company to arnold beckman lyons wanted a nonclogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines instead of having clerks lick stamps beckmans solution was to make ink with butyric acid a malodorous substance because of this ingredient no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it beckman decided to make it himself he started the national inking appliance company obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker fred henson and hiring two caltech students robert barton and henry fracker beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for reinking typewriter ribbons but marketing them was not successful this was beckmans first experience at running a company and marketing a product and while this first product failed beckman repurposed the company for another product sunkist growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time and the colorimetric methods then in use such as readings from litmus paper did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them chemist glen joseph at sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogenion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes and nonreactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile joseph approached beckman who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements he amplify his results beckman familiar with glassblowing electricity and chemistry suggested a design for a vacuumtube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for joseph the glass electrode used to measure ph was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter the prototype was so useful that joseph requested a second unit– beckman saw an opportunity and rethinking the project decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists by october  he had registered patent application us patent no  for his acidimeter later renamed the ph meter the arthur h thomas company a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in philadelphia was willing to try selling it although it was priced expensively at  roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components about – the original ph meter weighed in at nearly  kg but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment the earliest meter had a design glitch in that the ph readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes but beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode on april   beckman renamed his company national technical laboratories formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments– the company rented larger quarters at  colorado street and began manufacturing ph meters the ph meter is an important device for measuring the ph of a solution and by  may  sales were successful enough that beckman left caltech to become the fulltime president of national technical laboratories– by  beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own  square foot factory in south pasadena– spectrophotometryedit ultravioletedit beckman dk ultraviolet spectrophotometer beckman du spectrophotometer in use in  the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as  a huge amount at that time there was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range just as beckman had created a single easytouse instrument for measuring ph he made it a goal to create an easytouse instrument for spectrophotometry beckmans research team led by howard cary developed several models– the new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum they allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance giving a standardized fingerprint characteristic of a compound with beckmans model d later known as the du spectrophotometer national technical laboratories successfully provided the first easytouse single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultravioletabsorption spectrophotometry the user could insert a sample dial up the desired wavelength of light and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter it produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy the national bureau of standards ran tests to certify that the dus results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use world war ii penicillin poster beckmans du spectrophotometer has been referred to as the model t of scientific instruments this device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis by allowing researchers to perform a  accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only  accuracy theodore l brown notes that it revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples nobel laureate bruce merrifield is quoted as calling the du spectrophotometer probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort for example the role of vitamins in health was being studied and scientists wanted to identify vitamin arich foods to keep soldiers healthy previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks then performing a biopsy to estimate vitamin a levels the du spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes the du spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin by the end of the war american pharmaceutical companies were producing  billion units of penicillin each month much of the work done in this area during world war ii was kept secret until after the war infrarededit beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects there was a critical shortage of rubber which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks natural sources from the far east were unavailable because of the war and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute beckman was approached by the office of rubber reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene the office of rubber reserve met secretly in detroit with robert brattain of the shell development company arnold o beckman and r bowling barnes of american cyanamid beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists based on a design for a singlebeam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by robert brattain for shell the result was the beckman ir spectrophotometer by september  the first of the instruments was being shipped approximately  irs were made between  and  for use by the us syntheticrubber effort the researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the ir facing stiff competition he decided in  to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument the result was the ir which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light this allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time other secret projectsedit helipotedit beckman helipot potentiometer saa at the same time that beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry he was contacted by paul rosenberg rosenberg worked at mits radiation laboratory the lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the united states and britain that were working to develop radar radio detecting and ranging the project was interested in beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or potentiometers which were used on his ph meters beckman had trademarked the design of the ph meter knobs under the name helipot for helical potentiometer rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise by a factor of ten than other knobs nonetheless for use in continuously moving airplanes ships or submarines which might be under attack a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign and they were not particularly interested in the problem he eventually came up with a solution himself instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove in which the contact point was contained the contact point could then move smoothly and continuously and could not be jarred out of contact beckmans model a helipot was in tremendous demand by the military within the first year of its production its sales became  of the companys income beckman spun off a separate company the helipot corporation to take on the electronics component manufactory– pauling oxygen meteredit incubator s linus pauling at caltech was also doing secret work for the military the national defense research committee called a meeting on october   wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes pauling designed the pauling oxygen meter for them originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by holmes sturdivant paulings assistant beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument while the board of the national technical laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project whose details they could not be told they agreed that beckman was free to follow up on it independently beckman set up a second spinoff company arnold o beckman inc for their manufacture– creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge involving the creation of tiny highly precise glass dumbbells beckman created a tiny glassblowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls– after the war beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market they were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies doctors at johns hopkins university used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators– manhattan projectedit beckman instruments were also used by the manhattan project scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gasfilled electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors it was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment  substituting an inputload resistor for the glass electrode  the ph meter could be adapted to do the job as a result beckman instruments developed a new product the microammeter– in addition beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation to protect personnel of the manhattan project the dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber charged with  volts it had a small calibrated scale on top whose needle was a platinumcovered quartz fiber the dosimeters were also manufactured by beckmans spinoff company arnold o beckman inc– battling smogedit in postwar southern california including the area of pasadena where the beckmans lived smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation as well as an unpleasant experience first characterized as gas attacks in  suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers the smoke produced by local industrial plants and car exhausts the los angeles chamber of commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog as it related both to industry and jobs and to quality of life in the area beckman was involved with the chamber of commerce in  california governor earl warren signed a statewide air pollution control act authorizing the creation of air pollution control districts apcds in every county of the state the los angeles chamber of commerce asked beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local apcd the new apcd when formed asked beckman to become the scientific consultant to the air pollution control officer he held the position from  to  the air pollution control officer in question was louis mccabe a geologist with a background in chemical engineering mccabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind los angeles smog he visited gary indiana where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air returning beckman convinced mccabe that they needed to search for a different cause patent  apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere beckman got in touch with a caltech professor who was working on smog arie jan haagensmit they developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from los angeles air using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen haagensmit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material he agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog his results presented in  identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog– while haagensmit worked out the genesis of smog beckman developed an instrument to measure it on october   he was granted a patent for an oxygen recorder that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere– beckman instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution they even produced air quality monitoring vans customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry– beckman himself was approached by california governor goodwin knight to head a special committee on air pollution to propose ways to combat smog at the end of  the committee made its findings public the beckman bible advised key steps to be taken immediately stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations establishing standards for automobile exhausts converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities banning open burning of trash developing regional mass transportation beckman instruments also acquired the listonbecker instrument company in june  founded by max d liston listonbecker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers– liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions essential to attempts to improve los angeles air quality in the s beckman helped to create the air pollution foundation a nonprofit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog in  he became a member of the board of directors of the los angeles chamber of commerce and chairman of its air pollution committee he advocated for stronger powers for the apcd and encouraged industry business and citizens to support for their work he helped the chamber of commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog broadcasting smog alerts and addressing the smog problem on january   he became president of the los angeles chamber of commerce he identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog and supporting the collaboration of local science technology industry and education beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight his work with air quality continued for years and brought him national attention in  beckman was appointed to the federal air quality board for a fouryear term by president richard nixon electronicsedit john j murdock held substantial stock in national technical laboratories he and arnold beckman signed a stock option agreement by which beckman could purchase murdocks ntl stock from his estate after his death when murdock died in  beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company– on april   national technical laboratories was renamed beckman instruments incorporated in  beckman instruments became a publicly traded company on the new york curb exchange generating new capital for expansion including overseas expansion– cermetsedit helipot corporation the spinoff company that beckman had created when ntls board were dubious about electronics was reincorporated into beckman instruments and became the helipot division in  helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heatresistant suitable for use at extreme temperatures centrifugesedit in  beckman instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker spinco specialized instruments corp founded by edward greydon pickels in  this acquisition was the basis of beckmans spinco centrifuge division the division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges semiconductorsedit in  beckman was contacted by william shockley shockley who had been one of beckmans students at caltech led bell labs research program into semiconductor technology semiconductors were in some ways similar to cermets shockley wanted to create a new company and asked beckman to serve on the board after considerable discussion beckman became more closely involved he and shockley signed a letter of intent to create the shockley semiconductor laboratory as a subsidiary of beckman instruments under william shockleys direction the new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffusedbase transistors– because shockleys aging mother lived in palo alto shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby mountain view california frederick terman provost at stanford university offered the firm space in stanfords new industrial park the firm launched in february  the same year that shockley received the nobel prize in physics along with john bardeen and walter houser brattain for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockley semiconductor laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley shockley however lacked experience in business and industrial management moreover he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own the fourlayer diode rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and beckman had agreed upon beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind shockleys project were still sound when appealed to by members of shockleys lab beckman chose not to interfere with its management in  eight leading scientists including gordon moore and robert noyce left shockleys group to form a competing startup fairchild semiconductor which would successfully develop silicon transistors in  beckman sold the shockley subsidiary to the clevite transistor company ending his formal association with semiconductors nonetheless beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages– computers and automationedit the first picture of the moon taken by a us spacecraft ranger  on  july  beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments and the development of new instruments beckman instruments purchased berkeley scientific company in the s and later developed a systems division within beckman instruments to develop and build industrial data systems for automation berkeley developed the ease analog computer and by  beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace space and defense industries including boeing aerospace lockheed aircraft north american aviation and lear siegler the beckman systems division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft these included systems to process photographs of the moon taken by nasas ranger spacecraft– philanthropyedit the s were a time of change for the beckmans mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in corona del mar near newport beach california they bought the house in  renovated it and lived there together until mabels death in  beckman also chose to retire he and his wife mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths in  beckman was asked to become chairman of the caltech board of trustees and accepted the position he had been a member of the board since  in  he retired as president of beckman instruments and became instead the chairman of its board of directors on november   he agreed to sell the company which was then merged with smithkline to form smithkline beckman– the beckmans first major philanthropic gift went to caltech in supporting caltech they expanded on the longterm relationship that beckman had begun as a student at caltech and continued as a teacher and trustee in  they funded the construction of a concert hall the beckman auditorium designed by architect edward durrell stone– over a period of years they also supported the beckman institute beckman auditorium beckman laboratory of behavioral sciences and beckman laboratory of chemical synthesis at the california institute of technology in the words of caltechs president emeritus david baltimore beckman has shaped the destiny of caltech the beckmans are also named in the beckman institute for advanced science and technology and the beckman quadrangle at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign the arnold and mabel beckman foundation was incorporated in september  at the time of beckmans death the foundation had given more than  million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations in  it was considered one of the top ten foundations in california based on annual gifts donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as beckmans alma maters he is quoted as saying i accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists so i thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science and thats been my number one guideline for charity in the s they funded five major centers beckman research institute bri at the city of hope national medical center in duarte california united states beckman laser institute university of california irvine in irvine california beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford university stanford california beckman institute california institute of technology pasadena california the beckmans also gave to the arnold and mabel beckman center for the history of chemistry at the chemical heritage foundation philadelphia pennsylvania the arnold and mabel beckman center of the national academies of science and engineering in irvine ca  the pepperdine university school of business  managements mba program  after mabels death in  arnold beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity and developed new initiatives for the foundations giving a major focus became the improvement of science education beginning in  the foundation has provided over  million to support k handson researchbased science education to school districts in orange county california stimulating schools to integrate science into the k curriculum as a core subject arnold beckman envisioned the beckman scholars and beckman young investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level each year the beckman foundation selects a list of universities and colleges each of which selects student from its institution for the beckman scholars program the beckman young investigators program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences particularly those whose work involves methods instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science the arnold and mabel beckman foundation also supports vision research through its beckman initiative in macular research and the beckmanargyros award in vision research supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration arnold beckman died may   at the age of  in hospital

beckman conference center national academies awards and honorsedit mabel and arnold beckman arnold beckman was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  beckman was inducted into the junior achievement us business hall of fame in  in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in akron ohio in  he received its lifetime achievement award he was inducted into the alpha chi sigma hall of fame in  in  he received a special millennium edition of the othmer gold medal from the chemical heritage foundation in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to chemical and scientific heritage beckman was awarded the national medal of technology in  it is the highest honor the united states can confer to a us citizen for achievements related to technological progress president george h w bush presented beckman with the national medal of science award in  for his leadership in the development of analytical instrumentation and for his deep and abiding
