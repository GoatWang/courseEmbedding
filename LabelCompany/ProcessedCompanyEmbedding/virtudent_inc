why go to the dentist when the dentist can come to you by ilan mochari ilan mocharis debut novel zinsky the obscure fomite press 0 earned rave reviews from publishers weekly kirkus reviews and booklist bostons npr station named it one of 0 good reads for the summer he is a senior writer for inc magazine ilanmochari senior writer incilanmochari write a comment hitesh tolani credit mass challenge and virtudent if rerouting your dreams is a life skill then hitesh tolani learned it early in  when he was  year old his parents immigrated to the united states from sierra leone they brought  with them they used it to start a clothing store in columbia south carolina tolanis father applied for us permanent residency it was a promising start but over the next 0 years there would be many turns for the worse today tolani  finds himself at the helm of virtudent a bostonbased startup aiming to redefine how dental services are delivered virtudent sets up a fully staffed pop up clinicchairs equipment dentists hygienistsat your office virtudent is in network with four major insurance providers delta dental blue cross blue shield aetna and united healthcare  tolanis gratitude for the journey is profound given his beginnings but theres an asterisk to his appreciation he has a firsthand grasp of a hardheaded truth the worst news of your life can fuel your dreams but you have to work relentlessly and you have to work as if theres no other choice  on the verge of deportation tolani was  when his father died the next few years brought more harsh news tolanis mother battled breast cancerwith a mastectomy and chemotherapywhile keeping the store afloat tolani saw how she continued smiling at customers it was an early lesson in how to behaveand how to hustle in  tolanis mother learned that her late husbands application for residency could not be passed on to her both she and tolani were illegal on paper though they had a year record of paying taxes and upstanding community participation the immigration and naturalization service put them into deportation proceedings  meanwhile tolani had become a stellar high school student and also worked parttime at a ramada inn and a dairy queen harvard columbia duke and emory accepted him with full scholarships but he couldnt provide the proof of legal us residency they required only one school told him theyd give him a scholarship regardless wofford college in spartanburg sc i went kicking and screaming tolani recalls my mother took my letters from the other schools and tore them up and said this is where youre going  in the summer of  shortly before tolani began at wofford the family had their immigration trial the judge ordered the family deported they appealed two years later there was another trial again the judge ruled they had to be deported their savings were spent they had  days to leave the country  answered prayers halfway through his wofford career tolani was no longer the solipsistic achiever who thought the world revolved around himself he appreciated the school that stuck its neck out for him and he grasped how his status as a student carried clout  he drove to the local newspaper officethe spartanburg herald journaland told them his story within the week there was an outpouring of support for the familyeven in a post climate that was hardly immigrantfriendly tolani says more than  people contacted senators and congressmen on his familys behalf eventually senator strom thurmond submitted a private relief bill for the family shortly after graduating from wofford tolani got a phone call from senator fritz hollingss office confirming that he and his mother were now legal us residents tolani went on to pursue dental training at the university of pennsylvania while there he was an adviser to undergrads living on campus with them the undergrads became his first patients after they left school many of them still wanted tolani to be their dentist he began researching how telehealthservices delivered remotely via phone or communications technologiescould be applied to dentistry  tolani wanted not only to help his young patients but also to pay forward all the kindnesses done for him and his family he felt fortunate to be a healthy educated citizen of the us he wondered how he could take everything he was learning about dentistryand use it to help those less fortunate   an entrepreneurial solution a  investigation on frontline called dollars and dentists highlighted the roughly  million americans with no access to dental care it also shone a light on how dental practices overcharge patients tolani fascinated by the investigation recognized that telehealth could potentially address these problems here i am using teledentistry with my friends and i see that the market for this is actually more broad he says meanwhile he was completing his dental training at various stops with residencies at the university of washington stony brook and tufts today in addition to running virtudent he lectures at both tufts and harvard dental schools the threeemployee virtudent team not including its staff of dentists and hygienists started selling its services this july while the company has not yet raised any venture capital it has garnered some prominent bostonbased cash and recognition after honing virtudents business model at the harvard innovation lab last year virtudent won 0 third place in the tufts 00k new ventures competition and  runnerup in the harvard presidents challenge this year it won  as a finalist in the masschallenge a contest run by a statesponsored accelerator for employers virtudent means less employee time is lost to dental visitsan inconvenience that the american dental association estimates costs businesses  million work hours annually so far clients include wework and maxwell health the clinic provides basic preventative servicescleanings xrays dental sealants and fluoride varnish application and it refers patients who need further treatment to practitioners in nearby offices heres how it works in a nutshell virtudent visits your office and sets up the clinic if you want an appointment you book it through virtudents online patient portal your insurance covers all of the services you can also pay out of pocket an examconducted by the dentists and hygienists on the virtudent staff usually takes  minutes the cost tolani says is comparable to what youd pay for the same services if you visited a dentists office  within  hours of your exam youll get an email telling you your diagnosis is ready then you can login to the patient portal to view your dental health records including xrays intraoral images and notes so far virtudent is operating only in massachusetts since regulatory requirements are state by state but tolani and his team are exploring which states to enter next and while all aspects of teledentistry are on the table for the startup virtudent wants to perfect its delivery and execution of the popup office clinics before jumping into longdistance care  far from the selfimportant young man he was tolani finds it hard to discuss virtudent without invoking the institutionsand the  supporterswho helped him get where he is given its current capabilities virtudent is a long way away from fulfilling tolanis deepest dreams helping millions worldwide with no access to dental care but his life experiences have taught him that you have to start somewhere if you do the best you can if you show yourself to be an upstanding member of a local communitywell you never know how many supporters will be out there for you when you most need them  published on nov  0 recommended slideshow
