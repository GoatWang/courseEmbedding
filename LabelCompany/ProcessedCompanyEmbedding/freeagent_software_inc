are a couple minor problems but for the most part i really enjoyed navigating the softwaresetup ‚Äì this was love at first sight freeagent says you can be ready to start sending invoices in as little as two minutes from signup it took me about four the process is incredibly simple and well laidout even better a ‚Äútop tips‚Äù box at the side of the screen gives you important information about each step at a glance notably what needs to be dealt with immediately and what settings can be altered later along with a link for more help if needed once you‚Äôve run through the basic setup you‚Äôll be directed to the dashboard where a popup box provides suggestions for your next steps gorgeousorganization ‚Äì freeagent is an absolute joy to use it‚Äôs incredibly intuitive with a clean sensible interface and just the right amount of tips along the way it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get lost or confused the overview page provides a basic dashboard that gives you a quick look at what‚Äôs happening in your accounts there are tabs for contacts work bills expenses for sole proprietorships or my money for other businesses banking taxes and accounting some of which have dropdown boxes leading to more options additional features such as inventory can be found under the settings link in the upper righthand corner beside that is a search feature at the bottom of every page you‚Äôll find links to the knowledge base customer support and community discussion foruminstructions and guidance ‚Äì each time you enter a new area for the first time invoices bills etc you‚Äôll be greeted with a screen giving you basic information about that section i didn‚Äôt often go scrambling for the help pages most tasks are pretty easy to figure out but if you can‚Äôt figure something out or are new to accounting freeagent offers informational videos no longer than four minutes on how to create an invoice set up a bank feed create an expense or work with projects and tasks plus the scottish accents of the video presenters are lovely to listen to the knowledge base is also an excellent tool ‚Äì wellorganized with information on just about every aspect of the programproblems ‚Äì really i had very few complaints the layout makes a lot of sense and for the most part navigation is easy here are a couple nitpickscsv hassles ‚Äì while csv uploads are supported you may have to modify your file in order to do it freeagent only accepts ukformatted dates ddmmyyyy you can avoid this hassle by using other formatsfeaturesfreeagent offers an excellent feature set with some special treats for freelancers here are some of freeagent‚Äôs key features for the full list click hereoverview ‚Äì dashboard is set up ideally for a quick glance at the overall state of your company‚Äôs finances and projects it‚Äôs also pleasing to the eye with charts for cashflow banking invoices expenses and profit and loss color coding alerts you to upcoming and overdue invoices and bills overall it‚Äôs welllaid out easy to see important information at a glance you can also rearrange the layout if you wishestimates ‚Äì a great tool for providing quotes to potential clients it‚Äôs easy to generate estimates mark them as approved and convert them to invoices you can also set up an email template to accompany your estimates with plenty of merge fields options to save you some time includes  professional templates to choose from or you can build your own and all can be customized with a personal logotime tracking ‚Äì time can be entered manually or tracked with the software‚Äôs builtin timers you can easily add time to invoices with a variety of options all time on a single line time entries divided by task etc you can also save timesheets and attach them to invoices or create reports for your own use to track the time of multiple employees time tracking by project is a particularly useful featureinvoicing ‚Äì freeagent‚Äôs automated invoicing features are among the best i‚Äôve seen in an accounting program it is easy to set up recurring invoices automatic payment reminders even automatic thank you notes which can be customized and set to go out to your client when you mark an invoice as paid you can also attach files to invoices and include an online payment option through your choice of payment processors or you can save invoices and print to post if your company is into that freeagent offers  invoice templates with the option to customize if you know css and html you can also set a default email message to accompany your invoices very well laid outbank reconciliation ‚Äì freeagent offers both live bank feeds and the ability to upload statements in ofx qif and csv formats it supports over  banks worldwide check to see if yours is covered here it doesn‚Äôt support traditional bank reconciliation though a strong argument can be made that since transactions are directly downloaded from banks and credit cards there‚Äôs really no need for one freeagent also offers the option to explain transactions and can autoassign categories to transactions based on your history and in my experience the feature works pretty well but i‚Äôd prefer to be able to actually set up bank rules categorizing and matching transactions is a simple straightforward process though it could be a bit more efficient note like nearly all software offering live bank feeds freeagent partners with yodlee to obtain the feeds unlike most other software i‚Äôve seen the company is very upfront about addressing the fact that yodlee may violate some banks‚Äô tc props to freeagent for that read the article here to decide whether live bank feeds are a good choice for youaccounts payable ‚Äì straightforward bill entry with the ability to link expenses to specific projects very helpful if you want to track projectbased profitloss easy to sort by status and pull up outstanding billsreporting ‚Äì although limited compared to other accounting software freeagent offers seven reports profitloss balance sheet aged debtors aged creditors capital assets show transactions and trial balance you can download these reports in either csv or pdf formatexpense reports ‚Äì employees can enter their expenses and receipts into the system access settings allow you to confine each employee‚Äôs view to the data they have entered they can also enter mileage to be reimbursed at whatever default rate you set at any time you can view a running total of an employee‚Äôs unreimbursed transactions however there‚Äôs no way to mark employee expenses as approved which will be a hassle for companies in which the person approving expenses is not the one paying them in cases where you‚Äôll be passing on the costs to a client you can easily add expenses and mileage to an invoiceinventory ‚Äì freeagent has a ‚Äústock‚Äù area for basic inventory management it can be found under the settings tab once you set up your inventory list stock quantities will be tracked automatically based on your invoices the program also has a price list unfortunately there‚Äôs no way to integrate the two so if you buy widgets at  each and sell them at  each you‚Äôll need to enter data for them in separate places the cost and quantity of the widgets under ‚Äústock‚Äù and the selling price under ‚Äúprice list‚Äù it‚Äôs a very clunky design the good news is that inventory value will be properly tracked for accounting purposesprojects ‚Äì one of freeagent‚Äôs greatest strengths is its job costing feature you can create and track an unlimited number of projects projects can be customized or created directly from an estimate once created you can set budgets and startend dates you can also break the project down into tasks with options to track billable and unbillable time plus any expenses the project requires freeagent takes all this information and merges it into a handy chart that shows your progress and profit for small companies hoping to stay organized and on top of multiple projects this feature is particularly helpfulcontacts ‚Äì contacts for both suppliers and customers are easily organized under the contacts tab contact entries are automatically created each time you enter a new name on an invoice you can also import your existing client list clicking on each entry quickly shows any incoming or outgoing invoices or bills connected to that contact you can easily check previous or create new invoices estimates and projects for each entry it also shows the overall history with contact and provides a place for specific notessales tax ‚Äì while this feature is just fine for uk users it‚Äôs one of the weakest points of the software for businesses in the us the software is really only designed to handle a single sales tax rate for any given item if you have to deal with sales tax in multiple states or if you need to track both local and state taxes freeagent will not be a good choice for you the universal version allows you to track a primary and secondary tax if you live outside the uk or us you‚Äôll have to check this feature out to see if it‚Äôs enough to meet your needstax forms and support ‚Äì freeagent puts your data into a schedule c worksheet to save you some time when taxes come due unfortunately there is no mechanism for downloading this report if you are a firefox user you can attempt a workaround by using tableclipboard to download the data the program also provides automatic tracking of capital asset depreciation enter the initial purchase and depreciation rate and the software tracks it for you depending on your method of calculating depreciation the automatic tracking may or may not suit your needs if needed you can use journal entries insteadmulticurrency ‚Äì exchange rates are updated once per day you can invoice and record outofpocket expenses in  currencies but your own accounts and bills are restricted to your base currencypayroll uk only ‚Äì freeagent supports running a monthly payroll you can use the program to file rti submissions to hmrcfiles and attachments ‚Äì you can upload company files to your account and attach them to quotes invoices bills and paymentsapi ‚Äì developers can use the

base offers a wide variety of helpful articles and ‚Äúhowto‚Äù guides the freeagent blog also can be used as a training tool though it is generally used to promote updates or announcements there is also an extensive faq section as well as a handy glossary of accounting terms unfortunately some of the articles relate to the uk version of the software only which can be confusing for nonuk userswebinars ‚Äì freeagent offers a minute getting started webinar each weekcommunity forums ‚Äì discuss problems and solutions with other freeagent users here includes a section for feature requests as well as a forum on current common problemsnegative reviews and complaintsthere‚Äôs not a lot out there in terms of complaints about freeagent the software gets  stars on gcrowd but that‚Äôs because of a single negative review there are only  reviews of the program on that site when they do appear these are the most common gripesmobile apps lacking ‚Äì the single most common complaint about freeagent is that the mobile apps for both iphones and androids are severely limited these apps are missing key features typically available with freeagent such as billing and timetracking functions the company has said they are working on addressing these problems the first and foremost being tracking for mobile devices however they give no definite date for this update‚Äôs releasemore features wanted ‚Äì the second most common complaint regarding freeagent is that the us and universal versions of the software lack the functionality of the uk version payroll support is a popular request as

alternative for your company herenot really ‚Äòaccounting software‚Äô ‚Äì a few people have complained that freeagent takes the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to be an accountant to understand our software‚Äù

accounting reports ‚Äì freeagent may not be a good match for youlimited integrations ‚Äì freeagent only integrates with about  apps and programs    which doesn‚Äôt sound too bad until you realize some accounting programs integrate with hundreds of applicationsnot scalable ‚Äì several customers say that freeagent is fantastic for oneperson businesses freelancers or small businesses of  employees or under but that it is not robust enough to accommodate a business that grows beyond that pointpositive reviews and testimonialsfreeagent has an extremely devoted user base and rave reviews about the

impressed with freeagent the first time i checked it out and updating this review has reinforced that impression it offers a good variety of features while remaining simple to use and easily comprehensible to a nonaccountant the interface is very intuitive and the automated invoicing options will be a real timesaver for many businesses the software is especially good for freelancers who have multiple clients and projects but it will serve nearly any small business well freeagent‚Äôs generous referral program also gives it the potential to be one of the most affordable accounting solutions out therereally i have very few caveats about this software the biggest one is that its primary market is still in the uk and this is pretty obvious when you look at features and recent updates as of the last numbers i‚Äôve seen freeagent only has about  us users and while this number may grow in time it does mean the developers are more likely to cater to the uk than the us demographic if you‚Äôre considering freeagent for your business i‚Äôd highly recommend you check out the free trial and give it a go yourself¬† bio google latest posts katherine milleran itinerant

looking for a while for accounting software we are a two person firm it does seem to me from reading your work that either zero or freeagent would be the software for me i liked your comments on wave but came to the view that being a nonaccountant and not wanting the hassle of bugs and lack of customer support that even though it is free it is probably not for us what is the call between zero  freeagent for the australian scene presently we are under the gst threshold and are likely to remain there the time costing expenses invoicing and payment details are the features we probably value most your feed back would be welcome pleasethis comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated replykatherine miller november   at  am hi denisthanks for your question one of my own you said the most important features to you are ‚Äútime costing expenses invoicing and payment details‚Äù can you break this down for me a little more when you say ‚Äúcosting‚Äù do you mean ‚Äújob costing‚Äù similarly with ‚Äúexpenses‚Äù do you mean ‚Äútracking expenses‚Äù or ‚Äúdoing expense reports for reimbursement‚Äùi‚Äôd be happy to weigh in just as soon as i know a little more about your needs cheers katherinethis comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated replytom hodder november   at  am i found that freeagent was ok in  but there has been
