the distance to the rouses point bridge makes it practical for substantial motor traffic to use the ferry justifying the difficulty of keeping the ferry service operating the ferries used on this run are of the icebreaking type their hulls and propellers are reinforced to allow the boats to operate through thin or broken ice by operating continuously the ferries maintain an open channel throughout the winter ice season in the past the ferries did not operate around the clock but in winter time a few runs were made through the night to prevent the ice from freezing solidly now scheduled runs

vbmadvertisesubscribeeventscalendar of eventsspecial eventslogin you are herehome psb approves sale of burlington telecom to local investor a a a psb approves sale of burlington telecom to local investor tweet vermont business magazine the city of burlington received permission from the vermont public service board to sell the assets of burlington telecom to a local investor in an order dated november   but the city will continue to be responsible for the operation of the telephone cable and internet provider under the agreement the city will fund the largest component of the citys  million settlement payment with citibank through a sale of substantially all the assets of burlington telecom to blue water holdings llc which will then lease bts assets back to the city blue water is a vermont limited liability company formed by raymond c pecor iii as owner and managing member as part of a sale and operating lease financing pecor and his family are the owneroperators of the lake champlain transportation ferries and the lake monsters minor league baseball team among other things  mayor miro weinberger said monday “todays unanimous decision by the vermont public service board following months of careful review and analysis is great news for the people of burlington the psb’s decision – both approving  the settlement agreement that my administration negotiated earlier this year and determining that all existing and ongoing violations of burlington telecom’s certificate of public good are resolved – moves the city another major step closer to putting the financial uncertainty caused by the mismanagement of bt fully behind us i want to thank the psb for the care and due diligence the board and staff brought to this process we now will move quickly to implement the settlement agreement” the psb order click here said that for more than five years the city and its finances have been burdened by the consequences of actions taken by former city officials in funding investments in burlington telecom from  to  the most serious of these continuing burdens involve the potential exposure of the city of more than  million in the citibank lawsuit and the consequences of an unauthorized  million investment by the city in bt that was funded through non reimbursed shortterm advances to bt the officials now in charge of the citys government and administration were not responsible for the citys actions that led to the citibank lawsuit the citys unauthorized funding of investments in bt or the cpg violations found by the board in october    as proposed the largest component of the city of burlingtons  million settlement payment will consist of the  million blue water will pay to the city upon the sale by the city of bts assets to blue water under a proposed sale and operating lease financing blue water will lease bts assets back to the city for a maximum fiveyear lease term and will retain ownership of bts assets during and after the term of the lease unless there is a sale of bts assets to another private entity during the lease term monthly rental payments of   a year will be made to blue water from bts net cash flow the rental payment amount reflects a  interest rate and a year schedule of amortization on  million under the proposed financing the city will have the right to direct a subsequent sale of bts assets during the first four years of the operating lease if an agreement for sale is entered into within three years the city will ultimately receive  of the net proceeds of the sale after payment to blue water of the remaining unamortized balance of  million and other deductions or  of such proceeds if an agreement for sale is entered into within four years there is no assurance there will be any future sale of bts assets or any recovery of the citys investment in bt if the city is unable to direct a sale of bts assets within four years at or above a preapproved price  because of the increased performance lately of burlington telecom the psb suggested that a better end result could be for the city to pay off citibank with a revenue bond this had not previously been suggested by any of the parties ultimately the psb acknowledged that this was not a practical alternative to the complex blue water deal citibank did not support a plan that would have required voter approval which its uncertain outcome and it would have extended the process upwards of another nine months  the psb wrote no party presented evidence opposing the proposed blue water sale and lease financing in fact all parties to this proceeding support the boards approval of the proposed blue water sale and lease financing although alternatives to the blue water sale and lease financing to fund the citibank settlement may have been possible the board concludes it is in the general good of the state to allow the city administration and the city council to make the funding and financing decisions with respect to the citibank settlement that they believe best serve the interests of the city and its taxpayers on this basis the board approves the blue water sale and lease financing while it is unclear as the psb states what role blue water will have going forward the psb supported the conclusion that the city would be responsible for the operation of burlington telecom the psb wrote after the sale of bts assets to blue water the city will continue to be the licensed operator of burlington telecom and intends to continue to assume responsibility for compliance with the cpg and other regulatory requirements the board agrees with the city and the department that the city as bts licensed operator remains the appropriate entity to be held primarily responsible for compliance with the cpg and other regulatory requirements so long as the city remains the holder of the cpg to operate burlington telecom as the department suggests in its brief board oversight over blue water as owner of the bt assets should be less than that of the city as the operator of bt  the citys and consequently burlington international airports bond rating suffered and the cost of borrowing money has been more expensive because of it however as of april   moodys changed the outlook for the citys baa bond rating from negative to stable an improvement in the citys bond rating the psb wrote would lower the interest costs on new bond issuances by the city and might allow the city to lower its debt service costs by refinancing some of its outstanding bonds   view the discussion thread   subscribe join our
