analysts about oracle corporation stock  keycorp analysts commented we focused on oracle’s cloud transition and how moving to the cloud can generate x the revenue per customer as well as oracle’s opportunity in the saas market oracle’s opportunity in cloud and saas and valuation have been the main area of investor pushback since our upgrade as oracle continues to execute on its cloud transition we believe multiple expansion can continue key investment points oracle on average could see x the revenue from a customer who moves its workload from onpremise to the cloud transitions at autodesk and adobe showed lifetime customer value driven from the cloud is much higher than from onpremise as oracle moves its customers to the cloud it should gain a similar benefit for the customer migrating to the cloud can lead to significant overall cost savings based on labor and hardware costs needed to manage onpremise solutions   according to zacks investment research oracle has outperformed the sp  on a yeartodate basis the companys offerings in saas and paas have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters which improves competitive position against salesforcecom and workday further the introduction of gen  iaas data centers is expected to improve oracle’s competitive prowess against amazon we believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive topline growth for the foreseeable future meanwhile estimates have been going up ahead of the companys q earnings release however the transition from onpremise licensing to cloudbased subscription business model will take some more time to complete which will impact upcoming results moreover higher investments on iaas will affect gross margin expansion further a strong us dollar

metrics benefited from the addition of netsuite but they also looked better organically also good cost control and an improved tax rate give us reasons to be more positive on the outlook for fy eps growth however we remain concerned that consensus expectations for fy revenues about  implied organic constantcurrency yy look too high although margins could improve next year as optics benefit from the cloud transition we think they could be pressured longerterm due to a more competitive cloud pricing environment for enterprise applications and database we would stay on the sidelines   barclays plc analysts commented if the company continues to deliver we think investors would need to rethink the story which could lead to multiple expansion fx continues to be a headwind but we are starting to see increasing cash flow from the cloud transition story hence we raise our price target to  from  and reiterate our overweight rating  are investors shorting oracle corporation oracle corporation
