proceeds will be used to advance mitoconix bio’s lead product for the treatment of huntington’s disease through preclinical and clinical development and to expand its therapeutic pipeline to treat additional neurodegenerative disorders by improving mitochondrial function   “we are very excited to complete our financing round with a leading group of investors that recognize the transformative potential of mitoconix bio’s technology for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases” said dr eyal neria ceo of mitoconix bio “the great need for medicines to slow or arrest progression of neurodegenerative diseases motivates us to rapidly advance our lead product to clinical development and to create a pipeline of therapies for these devastating diseases”   mitoconix bio is pioneering a diseasemodifying strategy of improving mitochondrial functions for treating neurodegenerative diseases mitochondria are the energygenerating organelles within cells and their proper function is critical for human health excessive mitochondrial fragmentation resulting in small and dysfunctional mitochondria is a central pathological process in human diseases and specifically neurodegenerationi mitoconix bio’s lead product mtc is a firstinclass selective inhibitor of excessive mitochondrial division for treating huntington’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders mtc has demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of huntington’s and parkinson’s diseases   established in august  in the futurx incubator mitoconix bio’s program is based on the breakthrough scientific discoveries of its founder daria mochlyrosen the george d smith professor in translational medicine at stanford university school of medicine and her team the stanford team has identified the molecularbased pathological interactions leading to excess mitochondrial fission and based on that identified pharmacological inhibitors of excess fissionii mitoconix exclusively licensed the technology from stanford university   taro inaba founder and managing partner of remiges ventures said “mitoconix bio offers a disruptive approach of improving mitochondrial health for treating neurodegenerative diseases which is based on the breakthrough discoveries of prof mochlyrosen we are extremely excited to lead mitoconix bio’s series a round that provides sufficient funds to bring

the vision behind the ddf – of creating new opportunities in dementia research – being realised so early there is no shortage of highquality international science in the field and there is a vast opportunity in taking validated interventions and insights from other disease areas and applying them to dementia we know we are making progress and we look forward to building on this strong start and making a significant difference to the field the new investment by woodford investment management is strong validation of the ddf’s highly innovative approach” scientific strategy a goal of the

specific cell types in human brain tissue rather than relying on animal models to reveal critical pathways and receptors present in vulnerable cell populations as well as molecular responses in those cell populations to diseases such as alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease “we are eager to see cerevance immediately apply its powerful approach to dementia” said tetsuyuki maruyama phd chief scientific officer of the dementia discovery fund who will serve on cerevance’s board of directors “our scientific advisory board which contains senior rd leaders from seven global pharmaceutical and biotech companies is confident that cerevance will make breakthrough discoveries enabling the company to advance new medicines that may prevent slow or reverse the process of a broad range of devastating dementias” “there are  million dementia patients worldwide and  million more being diagnosed each year” said laurence barker phd chief business officer of the dementia discovery fund “with exceptional science a strong sense of urgency a leadership team that has previously succeeded together in drug discovery and solid investor support cerevance is well positioned to deliver life changing therapeutics for dementia patients” “it is thrilling to welcome an investor whose strategic focus is so perfectly aligned with our mission” said brad margus chief executive officer of
