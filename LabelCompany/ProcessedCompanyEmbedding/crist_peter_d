of russell reynolds associates inc a global executive search firm at  already considered a consummate matchmaker and skilled headhunter up at  am exercising on his stationary bike  hours breakfast meetings by  now founder and chairman of a boutique executive recruiting firm closer in age and experience to his clients two sons working for the firm serves as chairman of the board of wintrust financial corp board member of hinsdale bank  trust co and member of the board of directors of northwestern memorial healthcare at  still up by  am and exercising on his bike what being named a  meant to him it didnt dawn on me the significance of it until later years because i was in an early class and didnt appreciate the competition to get in until later on but every year as i studied the profiles of the participants i realized how significant the accolade was even though it was  moving on from russell reynolds i found myself in my early s tending to the firms needs which would be hiring firing and opening offices i was being pulled by firmwide interests when in my heart i wanted to be doing client work my mentors ferdinand nadhery and chuck kepler said look youve got to make a decision between doing client work or ascending with the firm this is when my true heart said i was a client guy and wanted to build a firm that was truly clientcentric being a client guy “now i devote all my time to doing client work on a national level were doing projects now with american express xerox — we have a project with safeway in california im a finder so its very focused but there has been far more travel time because clients want me to be out meeting the talent im a much better client person than a business manager and i acknowledge that i believe small businesses at the very high end can do extraordinarily well and i believe were hitting the cover off the ball right now” hes just a plane ride or phone call away im a  million miles american airlines guy did you see that movie with george clooney up in the air im that guy this business allows me great independence this business allows me the flexibility since i am a telephone and airplane person we have a place in naples and i can go to naples and nobody knows where im calling from and they dont care honestly if youre in an airplane and telephone business like me people just want to know they can get to you  hiring instincts what i do is a little bit of art and a little bit of science the science piece is the information we have the data we have its the art piece that comes to play when im physically with someone you do this for  years im not a phd but my instincts i think are very finely honed so i will be able to tell you certain things about a human being i can say whether its a good fit most of my clients at the high end at the end of a search will employ an industrial psychologist to shrink someone just to make sure new recruiters dont have the ability to assess like a year person does lessons learned not trying to do everything for all clients if youre a service business you have to pick where you want to go and put all your efforts into that rather than try to be everything to everybody i have learned that if you want to be successful you have to work hard there is no disconnecting the two i get up at  in the morning every day i work out and go to work and thats just the nature of the beast retire naw in my space it takes  years to get to a point where now im on an equivalent basis with my clients in other words im dealing with ceos boards of directors every day and im on an equivalent level because im on a public board im the chairman of a public company now our firm is playing at the level that all recruiters dream about you cant walk away from that now my clients view me as a peer as a partner the ceo of american express does not want a lightweight helping him at the most critical hire he is going to be faced with youll find the  under  class of  and links to
