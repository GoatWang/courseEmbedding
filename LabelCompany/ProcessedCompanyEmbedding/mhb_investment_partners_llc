hisherits receipt of personalized individual advice from advisor big windfalls and structured settlements – what they are and how to handle themif youve received this windfall it might sound like youre fixed for life the reality is that your financial life has changed drastically and you need to plan for it a structured settlement is a way of receiving partial payments for a major amount of money youve won or received in a lottery a court or insurance case you hear a lot of commercials on the air for getting cash from structured settlements but its important to understand what they are and how they should be handled if youre ever the recipient a good place to start is with a tax expert like a certified public accountant a financial planning expert like a certified financial plannertm professional or an attorney or structured settlement consultant who has significant experience dealing with these payment structures when there is big money at stake it might make sense to consult all three some ideas first the definition a structured settlement is structured like an annuity it is a contract written by an insurance company that provides periodic payments to a winner in a lottery a lawsuit or some other settlement arrangement over time amounts can be paid out weekly monthly or yearly the benefits structured correctly  and with the right oversight going in  a structured settlement annuity provides a payment stream that may be taxfree over a period of time during the winners lifetime and remaining payments may be bequeathed to his or her survivors after their death the pitfalls one should never accept a structured settlement agreement without vetting it against their own tax situation or estate needs also it helps to have an expert who understands these agreements well enough to know whether certain fees or charges connected with that settlement are appropriate to the overall size of the award keep it in mind that the structured settlement must be purchased by the person or company that is at fault or is making the award this is why its particularly important to have an expert watching over that selection process from the moment the award is announced the lump sum alternative if a winner chooses a lump sum payment over a periodic payment based on the full amount of the award that payment will likely be handled with an insurance contract that physically pays the lump sum but at a much heftier chunk of the full total  they get a big payoff for giving you a big onetime payoff keep in mind that the lumpsum payoff idea may not be worth pursuing unless its large enough to throw off substantial investment income in the future and that you have talented management making sure that lump sum makes money over time this is why its always a good reason to confer with tax financial and investment experts on the best way to go with either a lump sum or a periodic payment from the moment youve been informed you won the money keep in mind that others get an advantage too many attorneys are also structuring their fees that are taken directly out of a court award this allows them to postpone receiving their share of an award on a taxdeferred basis so they can build their own retirement funds theres nothing wrong with this but its important to know who else in the process might benefit from any decisions that get made february
