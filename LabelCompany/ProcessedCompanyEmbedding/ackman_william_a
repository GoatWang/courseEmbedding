air products  apd will replace its ceo john e mcglade in  and elect three new independent directors to its board of directors after bill ackman of pershing square capital management took a large stake

directors in august and sold pershings stake in the struggling retail chain for a loss of more then half a billion dollars ackmans air products campaign also comes as the hedgie continues to press a
