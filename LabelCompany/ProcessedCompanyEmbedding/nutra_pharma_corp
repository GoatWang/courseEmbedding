is whollyowned and acts as the drug discovery arm of the company this subsidiary carries out both the homeopathic and drug discovery research functions in addition to clinical development while the company is engaged in the development of therapeutics targeted at autoimmune diseases and hiv we believe it is the human overthecounter and pet products that should hold the greatest nearterm interest for risk adverse smallcap investors we like the approach of emphasizing the overthecounter market versus the therapeutic products that will require extensive clinical trials and a lengthy fda approval process we believe the currently marketed overthecounter pain treatment products will allow the firm to achieve much faster revenue growth and move the company closer to profitability these profits and future financings that could come about as a result of achieving profitability can then be utilized to fund longerterm clinical trials in the therapeutic areas these include research on multiple sclerosis ms rheumatoid arthritis ra and herpes all of these areas of course are of significant size and if the company is able to make progress relative to these areas it would likely become very attractive to the larger pharma operations possibly resulting in either upfront or ongoing licensing royalties after approvals for these therapies are gained by the fda please see appendix a for graphic representation of nutra pharma’s drug discovery pipeline toward these ends the company announced late in  that it had gained a manufacturing alliance with omnia biologics to produce rpim for clinical trials in pediatric multiple sclerosis it appears that under the terms of the agreement omnia will clone the alphacobratoxin gene as a raw material for the production of rpim and that it will also produce the purified clinical trial materials for the studies considering omnia’s strong ability to provide assay development services we believe this alliance could help speed the movement of the drug through the fda approval process the pain management market – huge unsatisfied demand according to the world health organization the number of people suffering worldwide from chronic pain is rising at a dramatic rate within the us alone there are at least  million people looking for solutions for chronic pain management according to other sources at least one in five people outside of the united states also suffers from severe pain this places the market worldwide at over one billion patients an additional factor contributing to this growing market is the vast rise in the world’s geriatric population which is quickly emerging as the key growth driver for the global pain management market with the global population of geriatrics expected to rise to more than two billion over the next ten years and as conditions such as arthritis and diabetic nerve damage continue to grow at nearly unchecked rates it is clear that the market for pain treatments will be robust for many years to come no part of the worldwide market however compares to the dramatic growth rates being realized in the united states americans are much more likely to seek pain treatment than are almost any other population in fact with only  of the world’s population the american pain management market accounts for over half of the worldwide market as of the end of  the pain management market is especially exciting within the united states not only because americans seek treatment at much higher rates but also because physicians are radically curtailing prescribing powerful opiate painkillers to patients the north american opioid market is valued at over  billion per year with the vast majority of these revenues being derived via pain relief prescriptions as is outlined in exhibit one as doctors cut back on writing prescriptions patients are more active than ever in seeking alternative treatments exhibit one – north american opiate market in mid the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc issued its first ever guidelines for dispensing addictive painkillers such as vicodin all but ordering physicians to prescribe such medications only for very severe and chronic pain with an estimated two million people in the united states either addicted or actively abusing opiates and approximately  americans dying each day from painkiller overdose it is no wonder the cdc has taken such drastic actions the curtailment of prescription medication usage and the increased exposure concerning the risks of prescription pain medications have created considerable media attention on over the counter pain management solutions and alternative therapies we believe this creates a very strong opportunity for companies such as nutra pharma rpim and cobra toxin – what is it and why is it important rpim is a bioactive originally peptide extracted from asiatic cobras to aid in investor understanding bioactive peptides are substances created in cells that play important physiological functions these bioactive peptides are produced in many forms by many different types of cells within animals  the rpim molecule is shown in exhibit two in very simplistic terms bioactive peptides are molecules that signal tissues organs or body systems to do certain things different types of bioactive peptides created by different types of cells affect the animal in different ways there are bioactive peptides that kill microbes in the body antimicrobial reduce pain opiodi reduce blood clotting antithrombotic etc these peptides play an important role in the regulation of body functions and in overall health the field of bioactive peptide research relates to the identification and isolation of various types of peptides that can then be administered to humans or animals in order to induce that human or animal’s systems in a positive manner to improve health for example many food proteins are sources for peptides these include milk fish eggs and plants like rice wheat or soy by isolating certain peptides in these foods the peptides can then be concentrated and given to humans or animal in order to cause the body to reduce blood pressure reduce cholesterol levels increase mineral absorption etc nutra pharma has utilized peptides from cobra venom create a registered homeopathic product   this allows the company to make specific health claims relative to the product and to make it available as an overthecounter drug these peptides have an excellent safety record with no measurable toxicity in humans in fact injections at  times a human dosage had no adverse effects on mice other preclinical studies on animals showed no mortality even when administered directly into the cerebellum brain of animals the product is also extremely stable and resistant to heat which gives drugs and therapies on which it is based a very long shelf life possibly measured in multiple years the clinical research on the peptides derived from cobra toxin is quite impressive with more than  human clinical studies completed the data from these many studies provide compelling clinical evidence that cobra venom provides an effective treatment for many types of pain and that there are very few side effects the company has been granted several patents on this intellectual property and has conducted several preclinical trials likely the most significant development relative to the use of rpim is the granting of orphan drug designation by the us fda which allows the company to fasttrack efforts through the clinical process hopefully toward eventual approval for a multiple sclerosis indication based on the orphan designation management of the company believes it can receive accelerated approval in a relatively short timeframe this of course will be dependent on the future availability of funds to drive this process forward in the meantime we believe the company’s best prospects relative to its cobra venom related technologies are for overthecounter pain products exhibit two – the rpim molecule source nutra pharma corp nutra pharma’s otc products the company’s first overthecounter pain reliever was called cobroxin which had been clinically proven to treat chronic pain nutra pharma began selling this product in late october  but discontinued distribution in late  due to a distribution disagreement the product was available as both a topical gel and as an oral spray while currently not being marketed the company indicates it plans is to eventually relaunch the product the company’s nyloxin product which is currently being marketed is similar to cobroxin containing the same active ingredient derived from asian cobra venom the nyloxin version simply has a higher dilution level of the active ingredient the nyloxin product is available as a toptical gel packaged rollon container or in a squeeze bottle and as an oral spray it is additionally available as a topical gel which is delivered via a pump bottle the oral spray is targeted at back and neck pain headaches and migraines with the topical gel being targeted at joint pain arthritis pain neck pain and pain associated with repetitive stress conditions in addition to the regular strength version the product is also available in extra strength which is targeted at treating stage iii pain that inhibits the person’s ability to function fully the nyloxin product line is shown in exhibit three exhibit three – the nyloxin product line source nutra pharma corp in december  the company announced the availability of an even stronger version of nyloxin for sale to the united states military and veteran’s administration in late  management enhanced its marketing efforts relative to this version of the product via the appointment of maj gen kenneth dowd as a strategic advisor the new strategic advisor will concentrate efforts on presenting the product to the us military and the veteran’s administration international expansion while much of the company’s efforts have been targeted at the us markets management is also pursuing international drug registrations in mexico canada india central and south america and europe while it is relatively easy to market homeopathic drugs within the united states rules in europe are considerably different and require careful navigation of the regulatory environment for this reason we believe the company is likely facing an uphill battle relative to marketing the product to european countries conversely it appears the company is making progress in the indian market and plans to begin sales and marketing later this year it also appears the company has reasonable market prospects in china as it recently received notification of acceptance to market the product nutra pharma is now working toward identifying distribution partners and recently indicated it plans announcements later in  lastly relative to the international market the company appears to be making progress in canada with a partner recently beginning to set up warehousing and marketing resources with a plan to begin distributing nyloxin in late  the pet market opportunity nutra pharma has expanded outside of the human market and into the pet and companion animal pain treatment arena via is pet painaway product line the packaging for this product is shown in exhibit four exhibit four – pet painaway packaging source nutra pharma corp americans love their pets and the pet obsession shows no signs of letting up   approximately twothirds of american households have at least one pet and most of these are considered treasured family members not simply animals that live in the residence as is outlined in exhibit five cats remain the most popular household pet at approximately  million felines in the united states this is closely followed by dogs of which there are at least  million exhibit five – total number of pets owned in the united states in millions source us humane society pet ownership is also growing very significantly in the united states approximately twenty years ago only half of american homes had pets with most only having one today not only are there more households with pets but also there are significantly more households with multiple pets for example as one recent market research study outlined more than  of american households are considered multipet our relationship with our pets is also changing dramatically as the number of single person households continues to grow these individuals are increasingly relying on close relationships with their animals a recent study by the american animal hospital association outlines this point with one of their most interesting statistics from the study  of married female dog owners reported they received more emotional support from their pet than from their husband or children the pet products industry has even coined a new term for this phenomenon – “the humanization of pets” – to outline this growing “petreliant” subsector of consumers the market size statistics reflect this growing relationship many americans have with their pets yielding some amazingly strong numbers for the overall market and for several of the overall pet market subsectors as is outlined in exhibit six while americans spend over  billion on pet food nearly  billion on veterinary care and related medicines and over  billion on other pet services they also spend over  million per year on pet halloween costumes and approximately  million on valentine’s day gifts for their pets exhibit six – pet spending booms   source aapa study on pets  while the sheer size of the market is impressive enough on its own perhaps even more impressive is the staggering growth the market has seen over the past ten years according to the american pet products association most of the subsector pet markets have seen doubledigit growth during this period for example as is outlined in exhibit seven the veterinary care market alone grew by  from  through  most who follow the pet care industries believe the market will continue to significantly outpace gdp growth for these the next twenty years exhibit seven – veterinary market of the overall pet care market continues to boom source american pet products association in addition to the increase in the number of pets in the united states there is an additional important factor that contributed to the rapid growth in veterinary care expenditures over the past ten years as the trend toward the “humanization of pets” has accelerated so has the willingness for owners to pay for expensive veterinary treatments whereas a decade ago most pet owners would elect to leave their pets untreated in case of serious injury or disease today more than a one third of owners would elect to incur relatively large veterinary bills to save the life of loved pet   approximately  indicate that expenditures of  or more would also be acceptable to save the life of a pet the statistics outlined in exhibit eight clearly show the willingness of american pet owners to spend money on their pets with million of companion animal in the united states and an increased willingness to spend money on pet related health there certainly seems to be a viable market for the company’s pet painaway product line exhibit eight – willingness to pay for pet treatments rising source american pet products association revenue drivers and financials in our opinion it is clearly the overthecounter chronic pain market that is the primary opportunity for the company via its nyloxin product line few viable solutions to prescription pain medications currently exist and consumers have a growing fear of overthecounter pain medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen for the most recently reported quarter the threemonth period ended september   the company produced  in revenue which compared favorably to the  for the year ago period the vast majority of this increase was attributed to the sales of nyloxin the company enjoys very strong gross margins for this product line at nearly  we are anxious for the company to report on potential revenue increases from its licensing and marketing agreement with deg productions which is focused on marketing the pet version of the product pet painaway testing for the direct response television drtv marketing program began in december it appears the company has also set a goal to receive retail placements for the pet version of the product by the end of  considering the considerable sums of money north american consumers spend on their pets as we outline above we believe this pet pain management product could generate strong revenue growth during future periods we also see strong international sales growth possibilities for the company especially relative to canada and mexico the company has made process recently especially relative to the registration process in canada and has recently brought on new distributors for mexico israel and spain management has recently indicated it believes these markets should produce strong revenue growth throughout  while we believe the nearterm revenue growth opportunities relate to the human overthecounter market and the pet related products we also believe there are strong possibilities for revenue growth relative to the company’s therapeutic drug pipeline considering the recent orphan drug designation the company will now be able to move back into clinical trials in a recent shareholder letter from the ceo he indicated it is the company’s goal to complete phase iii trials in pediatric multiple sclerosis over next  months and then seek a licensing partner or move directly into phase iii trials hopefully leading to an fda indication for pediatric ms opportunities and risks opportunity – gross margins – nutra pharma enjoys very strong gross margins which easily exceed the  level with such strong gross margins much of any sales increases will directly positively impact cash flow this cash flow can then be reinvested into the business to grow otc and pet related sales or be used to further fund clinical studies for the therapeutic products opportunity – drtv – could spell fast growth – we also believe a direct response program could be highly successful there are several examples of similar products designed for the pain and pet markets that have achieved millions of dollars in revenue through direct response television marketing initiatives opportunity – drtv requires far less investment than does retail – an additional positive aspect of the direct response program is that such programs can be implemented with minimal expenditures   typically a test phase is conducted and if the test phase produces adequate revenue and cost numbers industry financing can be obtained to continue to run the campaign in order to further grow revenues while this financing is not particularly inexpensive it can still be utilized as a way to generate significant revenue growth over a relatively short period time risk – competition – as we point out above there are significant opportunities in the pain management market however this means there is also a lot of competition chasing this opportunity to the company’s advantage relative to the competitive landscape is that it already has a product on the market with proven reliability and a strong safety profile if management is able to get the word out about the strong attributes of the product they could see success relative to the developing base of competitors in the pain management market there are also other companies developing venombased drugs several of these companies including bristolmyers squibb and abbott labs are huge multinationals with considerable resources of course it would be difficult for the company to compete against such wellfinanced competitors risk – capital development – management of nutra pharma has done an admirable job in raising capital to finance corporate operations in order to drive the current marketing plan it is likely additional funds will be required the company’s drtv infomercial marketing strategy likely mitigates some of the need for marketing related capital raises as much of the effort can be financed based on a results as financing with the drtv market easily follows sales increases   nevertheless we believe it is likely the company will need to raise additional funds drive the revenue plan it is unclear how much financing management will be able to attract risk – federal and state regulation – while the marketing of homeopathics and nutraceuticals is very lightly regulated in the united states the federal government and to a lesser extent the states have in the past cracked down on certain subindustries within the marketplace   the company will need to take great care in designing its marketing programs and in the claims it makes relative to efficacy risk – relatively low barriers to possible competitive entries – the company’s product would likely be somewhat difficult to replicate due to the cobra toxin component with that said if the nutra pharma were to achieve a significant level of success it would probably attract competitors that could rather quickly develop and market competitive therapies even if these competing products have substandard efficacy it may be difficult to fend off a wellfinanced competitive attack risk – dilution – in order to complete near team corporate goals we believe it is likely nutra pharma will need to raise additional capital these capital raises and conversions of debt to equity are likely to result in common share dilution management team rik j deitsch – chairman and chief executive officer rik deitsch has been the president chief executive
