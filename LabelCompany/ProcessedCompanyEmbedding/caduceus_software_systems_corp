provincial medical services database conforming to the icd  protocol the software is capable of storing medical imagery in raw format in encrypted datastores that conform to the patient data protection law requirements the software was trialed and sold to some clinics up until  we have discontinued the software because the medical ehr regulations and the software product was traditional and we felt it would eventually be allowed to “cloudify” the product depending on client demands and potential intereat  we will revisit the idea and possibly refactor the software from being a shelf

to content caduceus software  x  software systems amazon aws services amazon aws is a cloud infrastructure that small and enterprise companies use for web hosting and advanced networking services amazon aws has products our company primarily focuses on the elastic compute cloud ec simple storage service s and the virtual private cloud vpc products for our clients we have expertise in provisioning and converting your conventional servers to be “cloud ready” and port them to ec instances today there is heightened security over public networks private lan networks that have some internet access via a tunnel tofrom the outside world already have exposure to the public internet aws services allows you to create lans and vpc with the same rigid rules that you need to keep your network safe even though it is not physically in your server room   the extra added benefit to using aws over conventional means is that your compute power can be regulated lowered or increased infinitesimally using aws whereas if you attempted this on hardware baremetal you would need to spend money and expertise on scaling your physical network physical space power cooling cpu iops ram and redundancy we think that this age of compute is truly dedicated towards cpu and iops with less emphasis on the hardware network engineering is now performed on a higher osi layer which is friendlier and more efficient for the team as a whole because provisioning is quicker via not needing to deal with physical hardware constraints we at caduceus software corp are very interested in cloud computing and will offer our services to provision through amazon aws we will also offer newsletters and blog entries on aws products as we explore and learn as we go please evolve with us and

inventory improving cash flow and delivering the highest quality of patient care until now these challenges have only been partially addressed using software solutions available to the healthcare industry drawing on substantial evidence to validate its findings caduceus systems llc can show that a robust approach to automating the inventory and materials management functions within a hospital can provide significant improvements in each of these critical areas this is opposed to the historical approach of addressing a subset of these objectives to the exclusion of others our dedication to superior materials management information systems caduceus systems is dedicated to providing the healthcare industry with a bestofbreed materials management information system software product and topquality services as a solution to the challenges of managing inventory tracking its location attributing the use of supplies to the respective patient department or caregiver and optimizing the reorder and replenishment process today the business relationships and economic conventions that govern the healthcare supply chain are driven by a push or orderbased approach to inventory management this is far different than a pull or demandutilizationbased concept for the ordering and replenishment of supplies this pullbased approach has been successfully adopted by other industries and resulted in savings being measured in the billions as a viable means to improving cash flow without degradation in supply availability a materials management system deployment should anticipate this probable scenario and position the healthcare facility to act as a catalyst in this evolution as collaborative relationships evolve between hospitals suppliers and trading partners enhanced communication capabilities will assist in furthering cost reductions and efficiency improvements through technology like edi and internetbased eprocurement however caduceus systems believes that a thorough and systematic approach to automate the internal processes associated with materials management within a hospital is both a tactical requirement and a strategic prerequisite for the successful use of eprocurement materials management personnel clinicians and caregivers must have visibility and confidence in knowing what supplies they have precisely where they are located and have continuous access to the correct supplies when and where they are needed we at caduceus systems are confident that our software solutions offer the healthcare industry an unequaled answer for meeting todays challenges and offer a building block approach to exploit other contemporary yet proven technologies as biproducts of our companys commitment to ongoing research development and continual enhancements to the caduceus mmis the future relationships between healthcare facilities and suppliers will undoubtedly include a shift in some of the costs and responsibilities associated with the

consultant and provider richard tang president of caduceus software corp heads the implementation and execution of the daily operations of the company the daily operations of the company are primarily cloud based and we consult and provide expert install and maintenance on amazon aws services ec s route  and cloud front as well as vmware esxi   amazon aws services     amazon aws is a cloud infrastructure that small and enterprise companies use for web hosting and advanced networking services   our company primarily focuses on the elastic compute cloud ec simple storage service s and the virtual private cloud vpc products for our clients we have expertise in provisioning and converting your conventional servers to be “cloud ready” and port them to ec instances   today there is heightened security over public networks private lan networks that have some internet access via a tunnel tofrom the outside world already have exposure to the public internet aws services allows you to create lans and vpc with the same rigid rules that you need to keep your network safe even though it is not physically in your server room   the extra added benefit to using aws over conventional means is that your compute power can be regulated lowered or increased infinitesimally using aws whereas if you attempted this on hardware baremetal you would need to spend money and expertise on scaling your physical network physical space power cooling cpu iops ram and redundancy we think that this age of compute is truly dedicated towards cpu and iops with less emphasis on the hardware network engineering is now performed on a higher osi layer which is friendlier and more efficient for the team as a whole because provisioning is quicker via not needing to deal with physical hardware constraints we at caduceus software corp are very interested in cloud computing and will offer our services to provision through amazon aws we will also offer newsletters and blog entries on aws products as we explore and learn as we go please evolve with us and collaborate growth is expanding on what we know now and wealth is built on expanding into the unknown hop on board    vmware

agent and our finance consultant and estimator we have consultants from washington rhode island  canada and india to help on larger projects our humble beginnings the company started out making a medical software shelf product called caduceus mms it was an electroni  health records ehr system heared towards small medical clinics it also had advanced capabilities such as pulling data from the state and provincial medical services database conforming to the icd  protocol the software is capable of storing medical imagery in raw format in encrypted datastores that conform to the patient data protection law requirements the software was trialed and sold to some clinics up until  we have discontinued the software because the medical ehr regulations and the software product was traditional and we felt it would eventually be allowed to “cloudify” the product depending on client demands and potential intereat  we will revisit the idea and possibly refactor the software from being a shelf
