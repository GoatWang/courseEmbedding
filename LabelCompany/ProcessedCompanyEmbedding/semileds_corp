design file investors semileds illuminating the globesemileds search this site home » support » focus segments » uv curing datasheets application notes focus segments general lighting uv curing currency verification tanning optics design file contact us          uv curing uv curing refers to a special way in which coatings inks and adhesives are cured or dried using “energy” from uv light sources rather than conventional heat in effect the ultraviolet light spectrum in a uv lamp interacts with specially formulated chemistries to cure materialstypically more quickly using less energy and thereby at lower cost than by other methods  the advantages of uv have been welldocumented particularly when used with manufactured products that include inks adhesives and coatings on substrates that are sensitive to heat in addition uv is considered environmentally friendly since most of the solvents in inks paints adhesives and coatings can be eliminated thanks to the special capabilities of uv curing  the uv led technology is further revolutionizing the uv curing space since traditional uv light sources such as tubes and arc lamps contain mercury a notorious pollutant the availability of mercury free uv leds is bringing further environmental soundness to the uv curing industry  semileds provides a wide range uv leds in the uva range nm  nm please visit our products page to learn

upon and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes and other information included elsewhere in this quarterly report in our  annual report and in other filings with the sec table of contents company overview we develop manufacture and sell light emitting diode led chips and led components our products are used primarily for general lighting applications including street lights and commercial industrial and residential lighting our led chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications such as ultraviolet or uv curing of polymers led light therapy in medicalcosmetic applications counterfeit detection led lighting for horticulture applications architectural lighting and entertainment lighting utilizing our patented and proprietary technology our manufacturing process begins by growing upon the surface of a sapphire wafer or substrate several very thin separate semiconductive crystalline layers of gallium nitride or gan a process known as epitaxial growth on top of which a mirrorlike reflective silver layer is then deposited after the subsequent addition of a copper alloy layer and finally the removal of the sapphire substrate we further process this multiplelayered material to create individual vertical led chips we package our led chips into led components which we sell to distributors and a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets including taiwan the united states and china including hong kong we also sell our enhanced vertical or ev led product series in blue white green and uv in selected markets we sell our led chips to packagers or to distributors who in turn sell to packagers our lighting products customers are primarily original design manufacturers or odms of lighting products and the end�users of lighting devices we also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain led products and for certain aspects of our product fabrication assembly and packaging processes based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process we have developed advanced capabilities and proprietary knowhow in reusing sapphire substrate in subsequent production runs optimizing our epitaxial growth processes to create layers that efficiently convert electrical current into light employing a copper alloy base manufacturing technology to improve our chips thermal and electrical performance utilizing nanoscale surface engineering to improve usable light extraction developing a led structure that generally consists of multiple epitaxial layers which are verticallystacked on top of a copper alloy base and developing low cost chip scaled packaging csp technology these technical capabilities enable us to produce led chips and led component products we entered into a foundry services and licensing agreement with an odm partner in december  to assist us with the restructuring of our chips manufacturing operations we granted our odm partner a royaltyfree nontransferable nonexclusive license to use our technology and intellectual property for internal use by the odm partners employees at its facilities for the purpose of manufacturing testing and supplying us its products the odm partner is working with us to enable it to odm vertical chips for us using our vertical technology we believe these capabilities knowhow and partnership should also allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs and our dependence on sapphire a costly raw material used in the production of sapphirebased led devices we were incorporated in the state of delaware on january   and sold our first led chips in november  we are a holding company for various wholly owned subsidiaries semileds optoelectronics co ltd or taiwan semileds is our wholly owned operating subsidiary where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located where a portion of our research development manufacturing and sales activities take place taiwan semileds owns a  equity interest in taiwan bandaoti zhaoming co ltd formerly known as silicon base development inc which is engaged in the research development manufacture and substantial portion of marketing and sale of led products and where most of our employees are based key factors affecting our financial condition results of operations and business the following are key factors that we believe affect our financial condition results of operations and business our ability to raise additional debt funding sell additional equity securities and improve our liquidity we need to improve our liquidity access alternative sources of funding and obtain additional equity capital or credit when necessary for our operations however we may not be able to obtain such debt funding or sell equity securities on terms that are favorable to us or at all the raising of additional debt funding by us if required and available would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financing covenants or liens on our assets that would table of contents restrict our operations the sale of additional equity securities if required and available could result in dilution to our stockholders our ability to outsource manufacturing and our ability to get chips from other chip suppliers our reliance on our new odm partner exposes us to a number of significant risks including reduced control over delivery schedules quality assurance and production costs lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply and the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the contract manufacturer because of factors beyond our control for example both parties are waiting for the qualification for the chip products manufactured by the odm partner using their facilities the delay for delivering products on time at a satisfactory level of quality has resulted in difficulties for fulfilling our customer orders as a consequence our revenues attributable to the sales of our led chips declined if our odm partner were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products at requested quality quantity performance and costs or in a timely manner our business and reputation could be seriously harmed as a result we would have to attempt to identify and qualify substitute manufacturers which could be time consuming and difficult and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems our inability to procure chips from other chip suppliers at the desired quality quantity performance and cost might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems in such events our customer relationships business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected industry growth and demand for products and applications using leds the overall adoption of led lighting devices to replace traditional lighting sources is expected to influence the growth and demand for led chips and component products and impact our financial performance we believe the potential market for led lighting will continue to expand leds for efficient generation of uv light are also starting to gain attention for various medical germicidal and industrial applications since a substantial portion of our led chips led components and our lighting products are used by end users in general lighting applications and specialty industrial applications such as uv curing medicalcosmetic counterfeit detection horticulture architectural lighting and entertainment lighting the adoption of leds into these applications will have a strong impact on the demand of led chips generally and as a result for our led chips led components and led lighting products average selling price of our products the average selling price of our products may decline for a variety of factors including prices charged by our competitors the efficacy of our products our cost basis changes in our product mix the size of the order and our relationship with the relevant customer as well as general market and economic conditions competition in the markets for led products is intense and we expect that competition will continue to increase thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment for example some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices accelerating the decline in our revenues and the gross margin of our products when prices decline we must also write down the value of our inventory furthermore the average selling prices for our led products have typically decreased over product life cycles therefore our ability to continue to innovate and offer competitive products that meet our customers specifications and pricing requirements such as higher efficacy led products at lower costs will have a material influence on our ability to improve our revenues and product margins although in the near term the introduction of such higher performance led products may further reduce the selling prices of our existing products or render them obsolete changes in our product mix we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell and the utilization of our manufacturing capacity in any given period among other things for example we continue to pursue opportunities for profitable growth in areas of business where we see the best opportunity to develop as an endtoend led module solution supplier by providing our customers with high quality flexible and more complete led system solution customer technical support and led modulesystem design as opposed to just providing customers with individual components as a strategic plan we have placed greater emphasis on the sales of led components rather than the sales of led chips where we have been forced to cut prices on older inventory steadily growth of the module product and the continued commercial sales of our uv led product are expected to improve our gross margin operating results and cash flows in addition we have adjusted the lowerpriced led components strategy as appropriate we have adopted a strategy to adjust our product mix by exiting certain high volume but low unit selling price product lines in response to the general trend of lower average selling prices for products that have been available in the market for some time however as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices or execute new business initiatives a change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may increase volatility in our revenues and gross margin from period to period our ability to reduce cost to offset lower average selling prices competitors may reduce average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs and competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average selling prices to address increased pricing pressure we have improved and increased our production yields to reduce the perunit cost of production of our products however such cost savings currently have limited impact on our gross profit as table of contents we currently suffer from the underutilization of manufacturing capacity and must absorb a high level of fixed costs such as depreciation we are moving toward a fabless business model in which we would utilize foundry fabs to odm our chips using our developed technology as part of the restructuring we continue to explore opportunities to sell our chip manufacturing equipment to our odm partner or others which will help us to reduce the idle capacity costs while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we expect to be required to invest substantially in led component products development and production equipment if we are to grow our ability to continue to innovate as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to be innovative in product design to deliver new products and to improve our manufacturing efficiencies our continued success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new technologically advanced and lower cost products such as more efficient better performance led component products if we are unable to introduce new products that are commercially viable and meet rapidly evolving customer requirements or keep pace with evolving technological standards and market developments or are otherwise unable to execute our product innovation strategy effectively we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise execute our business plan or be able to compete effectively in august  we launched two uv cob module products d and d these high density uv modules are suggested to be driven at w and w respectively with efficient thermal management to differentiate ourselves from other led package manufacturers we are putting more resources towards module and system design along with our technical knowhow in the chip and package sectors we are able to further integrate electrical thermal and mechanical manufacturing resources to provide customers with onestop system services services include design prototyping oem and odm key markets that we intend to target at the system end include different types of uv led industrial printers aquarium lighting medical applications niche imaging light engines horticultural lighting and high standard commercial lighting the modules are designed for various printing curing and pcb exposure industrial equipments providing uncompromised reliability and optical output our led components include different sizes and wattage to accommodate different demands in the led market general economic conditions and geographic concentration many countries including the united states and the european union the eu members have instituted or have announced plans to institute government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting these actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds the global financial crisis that began in late  caused extreme disruption in the financial markets although the disruption in the financial markets moderated thereafter the global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained economic recovery when the global economy slows or a financial crisis occurs consumer and government confidence declines with levels of government grants and subsidies for led adoption and consumer spending likely to be adversely impacted our revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets including taiwan the united states and china including hong kong given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter therefore our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets for example the aggressive support by the chinese government for the led industry through significant government incentives and subsidies to encourage the use of led lighting and to establish the ledsector companies has resulted in production overcapacity in the market and intense competition furthermore due to chinese package manufacturers increasing usage of domestic led chips prices are increasingly competitive leading to chinese manufacturers growing market share in the global led industry in addition we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers some of our largest customers and what we producehave produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete large projectbased purchases and broadening customer base among other things for the three and nine months ended may   sales to our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for  and  of our revenues respectively intellectual property issues competitors of ours and other third parties have in the past and will likely from time to time in the future allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture use or sell products found to be infringing in june  we settled an intellectual property dispute involving cree we agreed to dismiss amended complaints filed against each other without prejudice we agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction that was effective october   that precludes us from andor from assisting others in making using importing selling andor offering to sell in the united states certain accused products andor any device that includes such an accused product after that date and to payment of a settlement fee for past damages all accused products sold before the date of settlement are released under this agreement and our customers and distributors are specifically released all remaining claims between cree and us were withdrawn without prejudice with each retaining the right to assert them in the future however other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products or our customers products that incorporate our technologies or products any table of contents such legal action or the threat of legal action against us or our customers could impair such customers continued demand for our products this could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations declining cash position our cash and cash equivalents decreased to  million as of may   primarily due to the combination of our net cash used in operating activities and payments related to longterm debt we have implemented actions to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve operational efficiencies the plan is further enhanced through the fabless business model in which we implemented certain workforce reductions and are exploring opportunities to sell certain equipment related to the manufacturing of vertical led chips to our odm partner or others in order to reduce the idle capacity charges minimize our research and development activities associated with chips manufacturing operation we believe we will be able to generate positive cash inflows through the restructuring of our chip operation and the significant ongoing cost savings in the form of reduced payroll and research and development activities the shipment of our new module product and the continued commercial sales of our uv led product are expected to grow steadily based on our current financial projections we believe that we will have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditure plans for the next  months please see critical    jul   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more
