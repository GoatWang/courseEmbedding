employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

facebook twitter linkedin close white elm’s whitehot streak july     stephen taub tiger grandcub matthew iorio is one of the strongest performers of the julian robertsonaffiliated managers this year white elm capital’s matthew iorio continues to have one of the hottest hands among the tiger management offspring iorio — who is unofficially called a tiger grandcub because he worked with tiger cub stephen mandel jr of greenwich connecticut–based lone pine capital for six years — posted gains of between  and  percent in the second quarter of  in his main fund white elm capital partners depending on the share class this was nearly double the nearly  percent increase posted by the sp  for the first half of the year the hedge fund is up between  and  percent compared with  percent for the sp  the strong gains come on the heels of a roughly  percent profit in  since its september   inception greenwich connecticutbased white elm capital partners has risen between  and  percent compared with just  percent for the sp  little surprise then that iorio has been able to bring in new capital of late according to his secondquarter letter dated july  the firm manages a little more than  billion more than double the total at the end of the third quarter of  the flagship fund itself now runs  million compared with  million at the end of the third quarter iorio and his team of analysts seek out stocks that could double over three years he also prides himself on making money and generating strong outperformance on his short positions we focus on what we can analyze and avoid macro debates he explained in the thirdquarter report in addition iorio looks for sectors and themes where he can find clear winners and losers that he says create dispersion iorio and his team eschew cyclicality negative free cash flow and macro or policyrelated debates put simply if we cannot answer the key questions with research we are not investing he told clients in the report like his mentor mandel iorio takes a global approach at the end of the first quarter only about  million was invested in us stocks our long investments in europe and north america continued their solid performance iorio stated in his secondquarter letter one of his biggest winners was also a favorite of his mentor cable operator kabel deutschland holding which recently received a takeout offer from vodafone group it was also among lone pine’s best performers in the second quarter according to investors we have owned kabel since its initial public offering in march  as we had identified the strong secular growth trends in the german cable market and kabel’s underappreciated competitive advantage iorio stated in the letter iorio also did very well with liberty global another major european cable company however he stressed that his long positions in north american companies were the fund’s biggest source of alpha outperforming the sp  index on an exposureweighted basis by more than  percentage points among the stocks in north america white elm’s biggest contributors to its long performance were the mortgage servicers the structural shift of mortgage servicing from the banking system into specialty servicers is progressing iorio wrote his favorites are ocwen financial corp and altisource portfolio solutions iorio’s biggest loser among his longs was golar lng a londonbased liquefied natural gas shipping company he is sticking with it however asserting in the letter that the longterm thesis is still intact given golar’s growing role in the global liquefied natural gas markets and the prospective upside from its expansion into floating lng projects in general white elm’s shorts marginally detracted from performance which is sort of a moral victory iorio explained that the environment for shorting remains tricky given the aggressive loose monetary policy among central banks he lamented the recent correction in many leveraged equities such as operators of cell towers which would be hurt by higher borrowing costs if interest rates continue to increase iorio however said the fundamentals of these businesses remain very strong therefore given current valuations the prospective returns for these businesses more than compensate for the risk of higher financing costs he added iorio also told clients he is looking for new ideas in more dislocated markets like europe that have lagged the us and japanese stock markets europe has traditionally been a source of opportunity for white elm as we have been able to invest in many highquality businesses at compelling valuations he wrote for example he singled out ukbased domino’s pizza group which he said is one of the largest franchisers for domino’s pizza internationally through great management effective deployment of technology to drive consumer engagement and an innovative menu domino’s uk has executed well in a difficult consumer environment iorio added entering the third quarter white elm’s five largest long positions in alphabetical order were altisource portfolio solutions a luxembourgbased provider of services to the real estate and mortgage portfolio management industry golar liberty global ocwen financial which serves highrisk real estate loans and sba communications corp which owns and operates wireless communications towers related articles  most read morning brief john paulson
