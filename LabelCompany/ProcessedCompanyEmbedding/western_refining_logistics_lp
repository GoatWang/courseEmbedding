includes delivering education and public safety information to our neighborspetroleum pipelines in your community americans consume more than  million gallons of petroleum products each day some of these products like fuel and heating oil play a fundamental role in our everyday lives underground pipelines transport half of all the petroleum products shipped domestically the use of these pipelines helps keep the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products down and are vital to our nation’s economy pipelines are safe pipelines are the safest method of transporting petroleum and they can operate safely for an indefinite period of time western refining logistics is committed to the safe operation of its pipelines for the safety of the public and the environment we maintain an outstanding safety record that includes hour surveillance routine inspections computer monitoring corrosion protection maintenancetesting programs and employee training you can help us by learning how to prevent pipeline emergencies how to recognize a pipeline leak and what to do if a leak occurs follow these safety guidelines and keep this information pamphlet as a handy reference is there a pipeline near you in fact there are pipelines currently located across new mexico and texas look for pipeline markers western refining logistics pipeline system transports two different products crude

transported and how to contact western refining logistics familiarize yourself with the location of any markers that may be in your neighborhood markers are located at public roads rail crossings and other intervals along the pipeline path call before you dig anywhere near a pipeline it is a state law that any individual or company must call  state of new mexico and texas one call center two days prior to any movement of the earth recognize a pipeline leak your senses of sight smell and hearing are the best way to recognize a pipeline leak and while leaks rarely occur recognizing these signs is the first step in protecting yourself your family and our neighborhood look for discolored plants or trees surrounding the pipeline in an otherwise green area flames originating from the ground or valve along the pipeline route a dense white cloud or fog bubbling in standing water an oily or multicolored sheen on land or water listen for a hissing or bubbling sound near a pipeline or an area of the pipeline smell for a strange or unusual smell – the product will have a petroleum odor like oil or a rotten egg odor possible hazards associated a crude oil the vapors of crude oil are generally heavier than air however not in all cases they tend to remain close to the ground and will flow along ground contours and may especially fill depressions such as ditches valleys and canyons in the event of a release of crude oil careful consideration should be given to surface terrain direction and velocity of wind and the proximity of ignition sources such as vehicles buildings and railroads crude oil vapors are flammable some transported crude oils may contain hydrogen sulfide gas hs hs is a colorless gas which is irritating to the eyes skin and respiratory tract at low concentrations and at higher concentrations may cause respiratory paralysis unconsciousness and death hs has a distinctive rotten egg odor b hvl high volatile liquids hydrocarbons are classified as lpg liquefied petroleum gas it is a petroleum derived gas which is compressed into a liquid and stored and handled as a liquid under pressure lpg is colorless and odorless in its natural form hvl vapors are flammable lpg gases are not considered toxic they can however dilute the oxygen content of air to levels insufficient for breathing the vapors of lpg products are heavier than air they tend to remain close to the ground assisted by the visible fog of condensed water vapor created and will flow along the contour of the surface what to do in a pipeline emergency immediately leave the area on foot in an upwind direction avoid making contact with escaping liquids or vapors avoid potential ignition sources do not light a match start an engine or automobile use a telephone or switch onoff an electric light or appliance abandon all equipment being used in the area do not drive into an area in which you encounter a leak or vapor cloud warn others to stay away from the area do not try to operate any

distributable cash flow we believe certain investors and financial analysts use ebitda and distributable cash flow to evaluate wnrl’s financial performance between periods and to compare wnrls performance to certain competitors we believe certain investors and financial analysts use distributable cash flow to determine the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders these

liquidity measure most directly comparable to ebitda and distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities these nongaap financial measures should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or net cash provided by operating activities ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are •         ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments •         ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt •         ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and •         ebitda as we calculate it may differ from the ebitda calculations of our affiliates or other companies in our industry thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure ebitda and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks to assess •         our operating performance and liquidity as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry without regard to financial methods historical cost basis or capital structure •         the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to make distributions to our unitholders •         our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and •         the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities distributable cash flow is a standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is in part measured by its yield yield is based on the amount of cash distributions a

presentation of these nongaap measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap ebitda excludes some but not all items that affect net income attributable to limited

three months ended march   the results of operations for the st paul park logistics assets are excluded from the ebitda and distributable cash flow calculations for the comparable periods in the prior
