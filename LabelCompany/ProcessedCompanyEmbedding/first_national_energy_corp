  item a  risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form ka and other documents we file with the sec if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or operating results could suffer as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and we caution that this list of risk factors may not be exhaustive our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as overall us and nonus economic and industry conditions a global economic slowdown geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time which we cannot predict additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition            first national energy company is a development stage company with a limited operating history that makes it impossible to reliably predict future growth and operating results   the company has not demonstrated that it can     ● manufacture products in a manner that will enable it to be profitable   ● establish many of the business functions necessary to operate including sales marketing manufacturing administrative and financial functions   ● establish appropriate financial controls   ● respond effectively to competitive pressures or   ● raise the capital necessary to implement its business plan   first national energy company has incurred operating losses since inception   since its inception in  the company has incurred losses every quarter the extent of the company’s future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain and it may never achieve or sustain profitability  the company has incurred a net loss for the nine months ended september   of   at september   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating loses for the foreseeable future and it is possible that the company will never generate substantial revenues from its products   the company’s future capital needs are uncertain the company will need to raise additional funds now and in the future and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all   the company believes that its current cash will not be sufficient to meet projected operating requirements for at least the next  months and it is therefore necessary that the company will need to seek additional funds from public andor private stock offerings borrowings under credit lines or other sources the company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors including     ● the revenues generated by products that it manufactures   ● the costs required to develop its manufacturing processes   ● the expenses it incurs in manufacturing and placing its products   ● the costs associated with any expansion of its business   ● the costs associated with capital expenditures and   ● the number and timing of any acquisitions or other strategic transactions                        as a result of these factors the company will need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all furthermore if the company issues equity or debt securities to raise additional funds its existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of its existing shareholders if the company cannot raise funds on acceptable terms it may not be able to develop or enhance its products execute its business plan take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated counterparty requirements   the company’s success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and technical staff   the company believes future success will depend on its ability to manage its growth successfully including attracting and retaining skilled personnel for its manufacturing and site maintenance operations hiring qualified management and technical personnel may be difficult  if the company fails to attract and retain personnel particularly management and technical personnel it may not be able to succeed in its planned operations   our executive officers board of directors and key employees are crucial to our business and we may not be able to recruit integrate and retain the personnel we need to succeed   our success will depend upon a number of key management sales technical and other critical personnel including our executive officers our board of directors and key employees with expertise in the industry the loss of the services of any key personnel or our inability to attract integrate and retain highly skilled technical management sales and marketing personnel could result in significant disruption to our operations including our inability or limited success in locating new sites effectiveness of sales efforts quality of customer service and completion of our initiatives including growth plans and the results of our operations any failure by us to find suitable replacements for our key senior management may be disruptive to our operations competition for such personnel in the technology industries is intense and we may be unable to attract integrate and retain such personnel successfully   we may have to depend on outside advisors for some of our primary business operations            to supplement the business experience of our officers and directors we may be required to employ accountants technical experts appraisers and attorneys or engage other consultants or advisors the selection of any such advisors will be made by our directors and officers without any input from shareholders furthermore it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an “as needed” basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us in the event management considers it necessary to hire outside advisors they may elect to hire persons who are affiliates if they are able to provide the required services   if the company does not effectively manage its growth its business resources may become strained and its results of operations may be adversely affected   the company expects to rapidly increase its employee base proportionate to expansion of its manufacturing capabilities this may provide challenges to the company’s organization and may strain its management and operations the company may misjudge the amount of time or resources that will be required to effectively manage any anticipated or unanticipated growth in its business or it may not be able to attract hire and retain sufficient personnel to meet its needs if the company cannot scale its business appropriately maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated and unanticipated growth its business resources may become strained it may not be able to deliver contracted products in a timely manner and its results of operations may be adversely affected   the company may be subject to potential product liability and other claims and it may not have the insurance or other resources to cover the costs of any successful claim   defects in the companys products could subject it to potential product liability claims for damage to property or personal injuries  the company’s product liability insurance if available at reasonable cost may not be adequate to cover future claims product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on terms that are acceptable to the company if it is available to it at all plaintiffs may also advance other legal theories supporting their claims that the companys products or actions resulted in some harm  a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage could significantly harm its business and financial condition   risks related to capital structure   there is no assurance of an established public trading market   although the companys common stock trades on the otc bulletin board a regular trading market for the securities may not be sustained in the future the otc bulletin board is an interdealer overthecounter market that provides significantly less liquidity than other exchanges quotes for stocks included on the otc bulletin board are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for other major exchanges therefore prices for securities traded solely on the otc bulletin board may be difficult to obtain and holders of common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original offering price or at any price market prices for the companys common stock will be influenced by a number of factors including     ● the issuance of new equity securities pursuant to its recent issuance of shares for a technology license or a future offering   ● changes in interest rates   ● competitive developments including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments   ● variations in quarterly operating results   ● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts   ● the depth and liquidity of the market for the companys common stock   ● investor perceptions of the company and the alternative energy industry generally and   ● general economic and other national conditions   the companys common stock is considered a penny stock   the companys common stock is considered to be a penny stock since it meets one or more of the definitions in rules g through g promulgated under section g of the exchange act these include but are not limited to the following i the stock trades at a price less than  per share ii it is not traded on a recognized national exchange iii it is not quoted on the nasdaq stock market or even if so has a price less than  per share or iv is issued by a company with net tangible assets less than  million if in business more than three years or with average revenues of less than  million for the past three years the principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities brokerdealers cannot recommend the stock but must trade in it on an unsolicited basis            brokerdealer requirements may affect trading and liquidity   section g of the exchange act and rule g promulgated thereunder by the sec require brokerdealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investors account   potential investors in the companys common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be penny stock moreover rule g requires brokerdealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor this procedure requires the brokerdealer to i obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation investment experience and investment objectives ii reasonably determine based on that information that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions iii provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the brokerdealer made the determination in ii above and iv receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor confirming that it accurately reflects the investors financial situation investment experience and investment objectives compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for holders of the companys common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise   following the company’s recent technology license transaction the principal shareholders of the licensor will have significant influence over the company   the officers directors and insiders of the company beneficially own in the aggregate  of the companys outstanding voting stock as a result the principal shareholders of boreas research corporation the company’s technology licensor will possess significant influence over the company giving them the ability among other things to elect a majority of the companys board of directors and to approve significant corporate transactions such stock ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control of the company impeding an acquisition consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company   the company does not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future   we currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  the company has not paid any dividends since its inception   anticipated liquidity and capital resources   the company’s management anticipates that substantial additional capital will be required to implement its business plan however there can be no assurance that management will be successful in raising such necessary additional capital if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced shareholders may experience additional dilution and such securities may have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to implement our business plan fund expansion take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures such inability could harm the company’s business results of operations and financial condition   risks related to wind energy industry   we have a limited operating history and we have not demonstrated that we can develop market install and manage our licensed supplemental energy generating systems on a large scale     we have a limited history of managing supplemental energy generating systems and limited data upon which you can evaluate our business our prospects for success must be considered in the context of a new company in a developing industry the risks we face include developing and acquiring successful relationships with large scale wind farms reliance on third parties operating in a competitive environment in which electricity rates will be set by the operation of market forces and regulatory constraints uncertain performance of our supplemental energy generating systems financing our business and meeting the challenges of the other risk factors described herein if we are unable to address all of these risks our business results of operations and financial condition may suffer            the revenues generated by wind farms depend on market prices of energy in competitive wholesale energy markets market prices for both energy and capacity are volatile and depend on numerous factors outside our control including economic conditions population growth electrical load growth government and regulatory policy weather the availability of alternate generation and transmission facilities balance of supply and demand seasonality transmission and transportation constraints and the price of natural gas and alternative fuels or energy sources the wholesale power markets are also subject to market regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission independent system operators and regional transmission operators which can impact market prices for energy and capacity sold in such markets including by imposing price caps mechanisms to address price volatility or illiquidity in the markets or system instability and market power mitigation measures we cannot assure you that market prices will be at levels that enable us to operate profitably or as anticipated a decline in electricity or capacity market prices below anticipated levels could have a material adverse impact on our revenues or results of operations in markets where wind farms qualify to receive capacity payments it is typical that only a portion of the wind farm’s capacity is eligible to receive capacity payments this portion is typically based on the previous year’s average net capacity factor during peak periods in addition changes to regulatory policy or market rules regarding the qualification of wind generation as a capacity resource could limit or eliminate a wind farm’s ability to receive payments for its generating capacity   the governments of the united states and canada may not extend or may decrease existing tax incentives for renewable energy including wind energy which would have an adverse impact on our development strategy   tax incentives applicable to the wind energy industry currently in effect include the production tax credit “ptc” and accelerated tax depreciation for certain assets of wind farms the current version of the ptc provides the owner of a wind turbine with a credit against its federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine the accelerated depreciation for certain assets of wind farms provides for a fiveyear depreciable life for these assets rather than the  to  year depreciable lives of many nonrenewable energy assets we also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated depreciation of wind farm assets will not be modified amended or repealed in the future if the current tax incentives are not extended or renewed or are extended or renewed at a lower rate financing options for wind farms may be reduced and development plans for additional wind farms could be adversely affected thereby severely restricting the number of potential sites for the company’s products   tax equity investors have limited funds and wind energy producers compete with other renewable energy producers for tax equity financing in the current rapidly expanding market the cost of tax equity financing may increase and there may not be sufficient tax equity financing available to meet the total demand in any year in addition one or more current tax equity investors may decide to withdraw from this market thereby depleting the pool of funds available for tax equity financing alternative financing will be more expensive and there may not be sufficient liquidity in alternate financial markets as a result development of additional wind farms and the company’s growth potential would both be adversely affected   the performance of wind farms and by extension the company’s products are dependent upon meteorological and atmospheric conditions that fluctuate over time the production of electricity generated by our supplemental wind energy systems will be the source of substantially all of our revenues as a result our results of operations will be highly dependent on meteorological and atmospheric conditions   operational factors may reduce energy production from the company’s supplemental wind energy generation systems below projections causing a reduction in revenue the amount of electricity generated depends upon many factors in addition to the quality of the wind resources including but not limited to turbine performance aerodynamic losses resulting from wear on the wind turbine degradation of other components icing or soiling of the blades and the number of times an individual turbine or an entire wind farm may need to be shut down for maintenance or to avoid damage due to extreme weather conditions in addition conditions on the electrical transmission network can impact the amount of energy a wind farm can deliver to the network we cannot assure you that any of our supplemental wind energy generation systems will meet energy production expectations in any given time period   as with all power generation facilities operation of our supplemental wind energy generation systems will involve operating risks including     ● our possible inability to achieve the output and efficiency levels for our supplemental wind energy generation systems that we have projected and   ● shutdown due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes violation of permit requirements whether through operations or change in law operator error or catastrophic events such as fires explosions floods or other similar occurrences affecting us our supplemental wind energy generation systems or third parties upon which our business may depend            the occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly reduce revenues expected to be produced by our supplemental wind energy generation systems or significantly increase the expenses of our supplemental wind energy generation systems thereby adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition   our financial projections assume that we will be able to operate our supplemental wind energy generation systems nearly continually and we may have trouble meeting our obligations if we are not successful   we will need to achieve high levels of availability and dispatch for our supplemental wind energy generation systems to operate profitably we operate under the assumption that we will achieve high levels of availability and dispatch in developing the revenue figures included in our financial projections however developments could affect the dispatch rate of our supplemental wind energy generation systems including the following     ● equipment problems or other problems which affect the ability of our supplemental wind energy generation systems to operate   ● implementation of additional or more stringent environmental compliance measures or   ● the market introduction of new and competing products which may be more efficient and cost effective than our supplemental wind energy generation systems   changes in energy laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or result in additional expenditures for us failure by us to comply or failure to satisfy requirements could also subject us to the imposition of penalties and fines governmental laws regulations and policies applicable to alternative energy sources are currently subject to modifications and are expected to continue to evolve resulting laws and policies may restrict the structuring of the sales of the power generated by wind farms federal law regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities we cannot predict whether federal or state governmental entities or regulatory authorities will adopt new laws or regulations or modify existing laws affecting the generation andor transmission of electricity or the ability of our counterparty wind farm operators to comply with them such new laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition   various state governments may not extend or may decrease incentives for renewable energy including wind energy which would have an adverse impact on our development strategy   various types of incentives which support the sale of electricity generated from wind energy presently exist in regions where we plan to market install and operate our products on existing wind farms we cannot assure you that governmental support for alternative energy sources will continue at current levels or that the wind farms we partner with will qualify for such incentives any decrease in such statelevel incentives could have an adverse impact on our development strategy   we depend on our ability to locate and develop new sources of wind power in a timely and consistent manner and failure to do so would adversely affect our operations and financial performance   our success in the industry requires additional and continuing development to become and remain competitive we expect to continue to make substantial investments in development activities our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to locate additional wind power sites this development activity will require continued investment in order to maintain and grow our market position we may experience unforeseen problems in our development endeavors we may not achieve widespread market acceptance of our supplemental wind energy generation systems these factors could materially affect our ability to forecast operations and negatively affect our stock price results of operations cash flow and financial condition   the number of desirable sites available for successful wind farms is limited and our inability to successfully negotiate for access with the owners and operators of such sites would limit our ability to implement our development strategy   we are a small company and we will be operating in a highly competitive market and this competition may accelerate in the future potential competitors have or may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources and in some cases greater name recognition and experience than we have such potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may also be able to devote greater resources to the development and promotion of supplemental wind energy generation systems than we can potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective counterparties it is possible that new competitors or alliances among potential competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share this would in turn reduce our market share reduce our overall revenues and require us to invest additional funds in new technology development if we cannot compete successfully against competitors this will have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow            we will depend on electric transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity that we sell we will typically connect to transmission networks through the facilities owned and controlled by our counterparty wind farm owners and operators the capacity of the local transmission network may be limited or constrained and the owner of the network may not allow us to interconnect our supplemental wind energy system without first constructing any necessary system upgrades many wind farms are located in remote areas with limited transmission networks where intense competition exists for access to and use of capacity on the existing transmission facilities we cannot assure you that we will obtain sufficient network connections for all future installations within planned timetables and budgetary constraints   our counterparty wind farm owners and operators are required to meet certain technical specifications in order to be connected to the transmission network if any wind farm does not meet or ceases to comply with these specifications we will not be able to connect to or remain connected to the transmission network we may also incur liabilities and penalties including disconnection from the network if the transmission of electricity by one or more of such host wind farms does not comply with applicable technical requirements in the interconnection agreements between wind farms and the applicable transmission owner or operator the transmission owner or operator retains the right to interrupt or curtail transmission deliveries as required in order to maintain the reliability of the transmission network we cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely impacted by any such interruption or curtailment   item b  unresolved staff
