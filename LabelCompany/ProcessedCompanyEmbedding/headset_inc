press otherhow did you hear about us ccia customer event employee referral industry reports partner publication ad purchased list trade show webinar website otherthank you your submission has been receivedoops something went wrong while submitting the formindustry reportswhat are the most popular cannabis productsjune  there are a lot more ways to get high than there used to be due to the legalization movement and proliferation of cannabis dispensaries if marijuana users don’t feel like rolling themselves they can pick up something prerolled and if they don’t feel like smoking at all they can get their high by eating a cookie or drinking a sodaso which products are most popular and will edibles or drinks ever become the primary way users get high at headset our cannabis retailer transaction dataset accounts for about  of legal marijuana transactions in washington state we decided to use our data to understand which products consumers are buying most—and the dispensaries’ profit margins from these salesaccording to the data flower which is “traditional” marijuana bud is still the most popular product with  of transactions compared to only  for edibles the next highest but many nontraditional products like live resin a special type of concentrate and carbonated beverages are on the rise we also found that while flower is the most popular product it is the least profitable product category for retailers edibles in the form of brittle and cake prerolled blunts and thc in pill form are the most profitable product typesaccounting for essentially half of all purchases flower remains an overwhelming favorite among consumers but a few new products seeing growth in excess of  per month could be indicating the start of a shift in the marketwhich products are the most popularwe began our analysis by looking at products from the broadest level we grouped approximately two years of transactions by product category and calculated the percentage of total transactions involving a product from each groupincluded in just under half of all transactions flower is by far the most popular product category edible and preroll are next at about  and  respectively concentrates and vapor pens which are newer crazes among marijuana users are in the middle of the pack while we can attribute this mostly to  preference it is possible that some of this difference is driven by the need to buy concentrates or oils less frequently due to higher potencyeach category can be broken down further into product types so we conducted a similar analysis with more specific categoriesunsurprisingly the top three products are all of the flower variety hybrid flower in over  of all transactions tops the list indica flower weed that gives the user a “body high” is next at  and sativa flower weed that give the user a “head high” follows shortly at  cartridges for vapor pens and wax which is typically consumed using a vapor pen but can also be consumed out of a bowl with flower round out the top fivea few surprising products crack the top  as well edibles such as chocolate cookies and even truffles rank above the famous weed brownie carbonated beverages a literal take on herbinfused drinks which hit the shelves just two years ago are the th most popular productwhich products are becoming more popularwe also wanted to see if any products are growing in popularity to examine this we looked at the average monthly increase in product transactions over the last yearwant to read the restfill out the form below to get access headset industry

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
