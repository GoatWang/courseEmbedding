reviewaverage rating  reviewssummaryrealtyshares has some strong points including adequate capital support from savvy backers a userfriendly website and some good press investors also like its low minimums  for your first deal generally  thereafter and hold periods as short as six months it is also trying some innovative things such as accepting bitcoin and providing marketspecific products aimed at its core investor base among it professionals in five cities but the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators the site does have some funds and multifamilycommercial projects but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the re crowdfunding universe investors who like the deals it offers will find realtyshares a likeable and easy to navigate platform but it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved background founded in q  by ceo nav athwal realtyshares has received  million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including  million in a series a funding in april  its backers include well known venture capitalists menlo ventures general catalyst partners and  startups menlo ventures’ managing director john jarve who sits on the board of hot automated investing service betterment is on the realtyshares board realtyshares has been compared to a lending club for real estate offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects it funds about  to  projects a month the inspiration for athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on realtyshares after the financial crisis of  traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access open a realtyshares accountquick factsminimum investment assets under management unknownyear founded number of users realtyshares fees management fees for investorsexpert walkthrough pros low minimum of  for first investment otherwise usually  focus on deals with short lifecycles cons deal quality is not high weighted to single family home flip market only for accredited investors high fees bottom line realtyshares is a smaller player in the realestate crowdfunding arena it has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments but its deal flow includes many single family home flips which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms its fees are considered higher than average too philosophy realtyshares’ founder athwal says that realtyshares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served especially small real estate developers and house flippers the process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the  economic crisis they often will not lend to individuals without w income crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns in one case covered by cnbc chicago house flipper ben walhood said he can get full funding from realtyshares in as little as an hour investors in his deals would earn around  vs loans around  if backed by fannie mae and freddie mac in traditional financing realtyshares is “able to provide quicker more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards banks just aren’t meeting that need” athwal said typical projects and geography at the time of our test there were five live deals on the site including a fund two single family flips and two apartment buildings three were in california and the others in new york and florida realtyshares has done transactions in  states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from florida california illinois and texas the deals we saw ranged in size from  to  million for the realtyshares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions minimum investment ranged from  to  and hold terms from eight months to five years realtyshares says it welcomes cashflowingvalue add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investment in fix and flips in high demandlow supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate target demographic realtyshares is only open to accredited investors meaning those with net worth of  million or income of  a year the platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the  million to  million range and all types of cashflowing residential and commercial projects realtyshares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model realtyshares said in  that  to  of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate interest in innovation athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities it is creating marketspecific products to enable developers in seattle dallas austin miami and chicago to raise funding from local investors realtyshares’ interest in innovation led it in  to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment the platform says this is a more costeffective and streamlined way for investors to send money especially if they are abroad because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers website popularity as of june  realtyshares has an estimated  monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about  minute on the site with  page views about  of the traffic is from the united states as of midmay  realtyshares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the united states leadership team realtyshares’ founder athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer he worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing california and national developers and reits in the san francisco bay area he doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid the management team is rounded out by eight specialists with handson experience in operations transactions engineering and other disciplines again they have strong resumes but not high name recognition realtyshares’ leadership earned a b grade in one review what do the experts think realtyshares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as  startups so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform but it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin blogger mark robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on realtyshares while he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays he said they have met or beat expectations summary realtyshares looks like a solid platform with longterm potential while its low minimum investments are attractive it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees it is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals especially fix and flip single family home projects it’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors deal structure investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or secondposition loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of  annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period andor a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property how does realtyshares screen investments realtyshares reviews the sponsors first looking for companies with experience it says it runs background and credit checks then it reviews proposed transactions including financials geography property type and quality and investment structure “while each investment includes risk and realtyshares cannot guarantee results our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform” it says “once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity and if so how much” so like other crowdfunded real estate sites it’s up to you to do your due diligence underwritingdeal flow ceo athwal said that as of spring  realtyshares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about  in  properties that are offered to it “i think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property” he said however the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips these are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lowerquality deals than bigger budget projects fees realtyshares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications but the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement the ones we viewed were plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher as best we could tell the ongoing fees to realtyshares as manager of the transaction llc amounted to  a year realtyshares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals this article says realtyshares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of  percent to  percent it also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment including providing investors with tax documents and distributions through the platform a realtyshares presentation for a funding round in february  showed it earning fees of  that is comparatively high among re crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment ease of use realtyshares has a more involved signup process than other platforms we have test driven while some sites initially ask only for an email address and password realtyshares seeks your phone number address employer amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you if you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment that might make you leery but it also suggests realtyshares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests so it could be a plus for some it offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with  return  month hold unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals after signing up you see a countdown clock on the day cooling off period you are also directed to a helpful eightminute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it we liked this feature a lot listings the page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow there’s a deal dashboard and tabs allow you to view an overview financials documents photos background on management and faqs one closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project which provided a wealth of information what am i buying on realtyshares realtyshares explains what you are actually buying this way realtyshares sets up a separate limited liability company llc for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform that llc in turn will make a loan on a real estate property in the case of a debt investment or hold equity in an llc or lp that in turn owns real estate property in the case of an equity investment when you invest through realtyshares you own shares in that llc using this structure you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level if you invest in a debt deal the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account if you invest in an equity investment opportunity usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents andor a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold as with debt investments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account how safe is my money as we’ve said before real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices and that holds even truer for realtyshares experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals real estate by its nature can be a risky investment and realtyshares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals while offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum realtyshares could do a much better job of making its site transparent it says it is currently affiliated with wealthforge a registered brokerdealer with finra and member of sipc both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors and that wealthforge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to realtyshares but it’s unclear if sipc protections apply to realtyshares investments even if they do they do not protect against loss in value liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors they would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer in truth it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate open a realtyshares accountrealtyshares reviews investorjunkie  there are various pluses and minuses with the service but realtyshares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors crowdfunding generally democratizes investing making it available to even the smallest investors the accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals we’ll give realtyshares a rating of  out of  stars with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative crowdfunding website reviews we have singled out realtyshares for the purpose of our first real estate crowdfunding site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye not the least of which is their forwardthinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using bitcoin we love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments this move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing the tech crowd open a realtyshares account lone star specialty products  llc  lone star drive abilene tx  usa  buyer report —

department pechiney manufactures ingots and sells aluminum mr sanders was suspended from work and ultimately fired on january   for substandard quality or quantity in work performance a charge which mr sanders disputes local  united steelworkers of america aflcio union filed a grievance on behalf of mr sanders which reached a step five arbitration proceeding on august   on october   an opinion

to be reinstated pursuant to the arbitration decision is an unfair labor practice pursuant to the labor management relations act   usca §  a hearing was held on the present motion on april    ii pechiney challenges both counts of the complaint with regard to count i pechiney argues in the alternative that the court should dismiss the count because plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted or the court should grant summary judgment because the plaintiff has failed to establish an issue as to a material fact that would support his claim under rule b  of the federal rules of civil procedure a defending party may move to dismiss if the pleading party has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted a rule b  motion tests the sufficiency of the pleading but does not resolve factual disputes the merits of a claim or the applicability of defenses republican party of nc v martin  fd   th cir  in considering the motion the claims must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and all allegations accepted as true id see also darcangelo v verizon communications inc  fd   th cir dismissal is appropriate only when it appears

sufficient to establish that element celotex corp v catrett  us    s ct   l ed d   the nonmoving party must satisfy this burden of proof by offering more than a mere scintilla of evidence in support of his or her position anderson  us at  s ct  with respect to count ii pechiney argues that the count should be dismissed because this court lacks jurisdiction to hear it a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b  of the federal rules of civil procedure raises the fundamental question of whether a court is competent to hear and adjudicate the claims brought before it pechiney questions whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to sustain the courts jurisdiction in that event all the facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true and the plaintiff in effect is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a rule b  consideration adams v bain  fd   th cir  iii section  of the labor management relations act lmra  usc §  provides for suits by and against labor organizations with respect to federal court jurisdiction the statute provides suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this act or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties  usc § a the supreme court has also created a hybrid  action by which employees may sue their employers for a breach of the collectivebargaining agreement such a suit as a formal matter comprises two causes of action the suit against the employer rests on §  since the employee is alleging a breach of the collectivebargaining agreement the suit against the union is one for breach of the unions duty of fair representation which is implied under the scheme of the national labor relations act yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent to prevail against either the company or the union  employeeplaintiffs must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the union the employee may if he chooses sue one defendant and not the other but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one the other or both the suit is thus not a straightforward breachofcontract suit under §   but a hybrid § fair representation claim amounting to a direct challenge to the private settlement of disputes under the collectivebargaining agreement delcostello v international bhd of teamsters  us    s ct   l ed d   internal citations omitted see also thompson v aluminum co of am  fd  th cir  pechineys motion is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege any breach of duty by the union in his response to pechineys motion plaintiff contends that the present action is simply one to enforce an arbitration award and in no sense a socalled hybrid  claim in which a breach by the union of its duty of fair representation must first  be demonstrated plaintiffs memorandum in opposition to pechineys motion to dismiss at  thus the primary issue presented to the court is whether or not plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to sustain a claim for enforcing an arbitration award when plaintiff has not alleged any wrongdoing by the union section  of the lmra provides jurisdiction for suits in the district court between labor organizations employers and employees for violations of collective bargaining agreements hines v anchor motor freight inc  us    s ct   l ed d   suits under §  encompass those seeking to vindicate uniquely personal rights of employees such as wages id quoting smith v evening news assn  us    s ct   l ed d   the eleventh circuit has addressed the required showing that the plaintiff in this case must make to prevail on his claim as the courts have made clear when an employee sues his employer under section  for breach of uniquely personal rights created by a collective bargaining agreement after the employer has settled the controversy with the employees union representative pursuant to binding grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement the employee is required in some way to show that the unions duty to represent him fairly  has been breached before he is entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim diaz v schwerman trucking co  fd   th cir quoting united parcel service inc v mitchell  us   s ct   l ed d   in diaz the eleventh circuit upheld the district courts denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the plaintiffemployee had alleged inter alia that the employer refused to comply with the arbitrators decision and that the union did not enforce the decision thereby breaching its duty of fair representation id at  the second circuit has also addressed the case where an employee brings suit to challenge an arbitration award holding if there is no claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation an individual employee represented by a union generally does not have standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding to which the union and the employer were the only parties plaintiff was not a party to the arbitration between the union and employer in addition nothing in plaintiffs petition supports a claim for breach of duty on the part of the union accordingly plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the award and her petition was properly dismissed katir v columbia univ  fd   nd cir  internal citations omitted the eighth circuit has also required a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation in failing to enforce the arbitration award in order for an employee to prevail against the employer livingstone v schnuck mkt inc  fd  th cir the seventh circuit has noted that there are two exceptions to this rule neither of which is applicable to the case at hand  in a similar factual case to the one at hand a court in this district recently affirmed the requirement that an employee must demonstrate bad faith on the part of the union to enforce an arbitration decision against the employer smoot v eagle energy inc civil action no   us dist lexis  sdw va knapp j see also cannelton indus inc v district  united mine workers of am  f supp d  sdwva haden cj in smoot the district court evaluated the complaint based on the katir principle that individual union members do not generally have standing under section  of the labor management relations act to challenge modify or confirm arbitration awards id the court then dismissed the action because plaintiff herein is not a party to the arbitration award and therefore cannot seek to enforce the award even though the award addresses plaintiffs recall rights id the court particularly relied on the fact that the union was contemporaneously seeking to enforce the arbitration through a separate legal action in much the same way as the union in the present case is doing through its grievance procedures plaintiff makes several arguments to support the adequacy of the complaint first plaintiff points out that the union and pechiney have agreed to an arbitration procedure for settling grievances plaintiff goes on to state naturally in signing the cba both pechiney and the union agreed to abide by the results of any arbitration award in this case the union has done so but pechiney has not because it has not mr sanders has a cause of action against pechiney for breach of contract plaintiffs memorandum in opposition to pechineys motion to dismiss at  emphasis added this is an inaccurate statement the cause of action in this case belongs to the union not to mr sanders because mr sanders was neither a party to the collective bargaining agreement nor to the arbitration as the fourth circuit has recently stated an individual employee represented by a union  generally does not have standing to challenge modify or confirm an arbitration award because he was not a party to the arbitration bryant v bell atl md inc  fd   th cir in bryant the fourth circuit affirmed the district courts grant of defendants motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff had not attempted to show that the union breached its duty of fair representation thus the court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to enforce the arbitration award id plaintiff also relies on williams v united states steel  f supp  ndind affd  fd  th cir in williams an employee brought suit under §  to enforce an arbitration award that the union secured on his behalf defendant moved for summary judgment arguing that the complaint was timebarred based on the sixmonth limitation announced in delcostello the court found that in the seventh circuit unions did not have a duty to enforce an arbitration award therefore the enforcement of the award is left to the employee through a straight §  suit not a hybrid  id at  this court declines to follow williams for two reasons first the holding in williams is contrary to the language discussed above in bryant which is the applicable law in this circuit second it is extremely unclear as to whether williams is even the governing law in the seventh circuit in cleveland v porca co   fd  th cir the seventh circuit was presented with a group of employees who sued to enforce an arbitration order under §  the employees filed suit against the employer for violation of the collective bargaining agreement and against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation the seventh circuit first analyzed the claim against the union and found no breach of duty id at  the court went on to analyze the claim against the employer holding the plaintiffs lack standing to enforce the arbitration award however because when employees are represented by a union they are not parties to either the collective bargaining agreement or any union company arbitration the plaintiffs also cannot maintain a claim against the employer under section  for breach of the collective bargaining agreement to state such a claim the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the employer breached the collective bargaining agreement and that the union violated its duty of fair representation id at  this court is inclined to follow the holding of the seventh circuit rather than a district court therein particularly since bryant refers to and applies this language next plaintiff relies on teamsters local union no  v keal driveaway co  fd  th cir plaintiff singularly relies on keal driveaways discussion of the hybrid suit wherein the court stated it is true that an employee or local union may maintain separate actions for distinct injuries resulting from an employers breach of contract and a unions breach of its duty of representation in the handling of a subsequent grievance id at  this statement is inapplicable to plaintiffs argument first keal driveaway involved a motion to dismiss based on the failure to join a necessary party where a union which lost an arbitration sued the employer but not the union that won the arbitration the issue was failure to add a necessary party not standing to bring the action furthermore the above quoted language only allows for suits to be brought by either an employee or a local union against both the employer and the union the language does not however preempt the requirements of a suit by sanders against pechiney one of which is to allege breach of duty of fair representation against the union see delcostello  us at   s ct  finally plaintiff relies on wilks v american bakeries co  f supp  wdnc plaintiff argues that wilks is a factually similar case in which the employee was allowed to bring suit against the employer wilks however is not at all like the present case because in wilks both the employee and the union filed suit against the employer under §  there is no question that §  allows suits by unions against employers to enforce arbitration agreements in the present case not only is the union a defendant but sanders has specifically denied any breach of a duty of fair representation by the union wilks does not inform the present question plaintiff argues that it seems bizarre to allow repeated arbitrations to settle disputes over the enforcement of previous awards plaintiffs remedy is to bring a suit against pechiney and allege a breach by the union if he believes the union is breaching its duty of fair representation by failing to seek enforcement of a favorable arbitration award this would prevent plaintiffs russian dolls hypothetical wherein an endless string of arbitrations is required to enforce a single decision as noted during argument however the union is grieving the plaintiffs claim that his firing was improper and a pretext to circumvent the arbitrators award   iv count ii of the complaint alleges that pechineys failure to reinstate plaintiff pursuant to the arbitration decision constitutes an unfair labor practice pursuant to  usc §  pechiney argues that this court does not have jurisdiction over this count because the national labor relations board has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim plaintiff argues that since arbitration awards are enforced in federal courts then this claim can also be heard in federal court plaintiff is again incorrect as discussed above plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to maintain its claim to enforce the arbitration decision therefore if count ii merely alleges damages based on pechineys alleged refusal to implement the decision then this count is repetitive and must also be dismissed if as plaintiff seems to argue this is a wholly separate count then its jurisdiction must be separately assessed the supreme court has recently summarized the law with respect to federal court jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims when a plaintiff challenges an action that is arguably subject to §  or §  of the nlra this challenge is within the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb but when a plaintiff alleges a breach of the duty of fair representation this claim is cognizable in the first instance in federal court the qualificationif her challenge is a duty of fair representation claimis important the ritualistic incantation of the phrase duty of fair representation is insufficient to invoke the primary jurisdiction of federal courts as we noted in beck employees may not circumvent the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb simply by casting statutory claims as violations of the unions duty of fair representation when a plaintiffs only claim is that the union violated the nlra the plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdiction of the nlrb by characterizing this alleged statutory violation as a breach of the duty of fair representation to invoke federal jurisdiction when the claim is based in part on a violation of the nlra there must be something more than just a claim that the union violated the statute the plaintiff must adduce facts suggesting that the unions violation of the statute was arbitrary discriminatory or in bad faith  the power of federal courts to resolve statutory issues under the nlra when they arise as collateral matters in a duty of fair representation suit does not open the door for federal court first instance resolution of all statutory claims federal courts can only resolve §  and §  claims that are collateral to a duty of fair representation claim marquez v screen actors guild  us    s ct   l ed d   citing san diego bldg trades council v garmon  us    s ct   l ed d   vaca v sipes  us    s ct   l ed d   communications workers of am v beck  us   s ct   l ed d   just as the supreme court has not allowed the bootstrapping of unfair labor practice claims by relabeling them as a breach of the duty of fair representation this court will not allow identical bootstrapping by plaintiffs characterization of his claim as enforcing an arbitration award plaintiffs count ii relies solely on  usc §  which is one of two sections that garmon declares to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb see garmon  us at   s ct  plaintiff has failed to state a claim against pechiney to enforce the arbitration award this court is not fooled by plaintiffs semantics and an examination of the specific paragraphs of  count ii

casting department pechiney manufactures ingots and sells aluminum mr sanders was suspended from work and ultimately fired on january   for substandard quality or quantity in work performance a charge which mr sanders disputes local  united steelworkers of america aflcio union filed a grievance on behalf of mr sanders which reached a step five arbitration proceeding on august   on october   an

currently set for arbitration before the original arbitrator on may   sanders filed the present action on january   count i of the complaint alleges breach of the collective bargaining agreement and seeks to enforce the october   arbitration award count ii is entitled unfair labor practice and alleges that the employers flagrant disregard for the collective bargaining process and for the rights of the plaintiff to be reinstated pursuant to the arbitration decision is an unfair labor practice pursuant to the labor management relations act   usca §  a hearing was held on the present motion on april   ii pechiney challenges both counts of the complaint with regard to count i pechiney argues in the alternative that the court should dismiss the count because plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted or the court should grant summary judgment because the plaintiff has failed to establish an issue as to a material fact that would support his claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure a defending party may move to dismiss if the pleading party has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted a rule b motion tests the sufficiency of the pleading but does not resolve factual disputes the merits of a claim or the applicability of defenses republican party of nc v martin  fd   th cir in considering the motion the claims must be

favor anderson  us at   s ct  summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmoving party has the burden of proof on an essential element of his or her case and does not make after adequate time for discovery a showing sufficient to establish that element celotex corp v catrett  us    s ct   l ed d   the nonmoving party must satisfy this burden of proof by offering more than a mere scintilla of evidence in support of his or her position anderson  us at  s ct  with respect to count ii pechiney argues that the count should be dismissed because this court lacks jurisdiction to hear it a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure raises the fundamental question of whether a court is competent to hear and adjudicate the claims brought before it pechiney questions whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to sustain the courts jurisdiction in that event all the facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true and the plaintiff in effect is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a rule b consideration adams v bain  fd   th cir iii section  of the labor management relations act lmra  usc §  provides for suits by and against labor organizations with respect to federal court jurisdiction the statute provides suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this act or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties  usc § a the supreme court has also created a hybrid  action by which employees may sue their employers for a breach of the collectivebargaining agreement such a suit as a formal matter comprises two causes of action the suit against the employer rests on §  since the employee is alleging a breach of the collectivebargaining agreement the suit against the union is one for breach of the unions duty of fair representation which is implied under the scheme of the national labor relations act yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent to prevail against either the company or the union  employeeplaintiffs must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the union the employee may if he chooses sue one defendant and not the other but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one the other or both the suit is thus not a straightforward breachofcontract suit under §   but a hybrid § fair representation claim amounting to a direct challenge to the private settlement of disputes under the collectivebargaining agreement delcostello v international bhd of teamsters  us    s ct   l ed d   internal citations omitted see also thompson v aluminum co of am  fd  th cir  pechineys motion is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege any breach of duty by the union in his response to pechineys motion plaintiff contends that the present action is simply one to enforce an arbitration award and in no sense a socalled hybrid  claim in which a breach by the union of its duty of fair representation must first  be demonstrated plaintiffs memorandum in opposition to pechineys motion to dismiss at  thus the primary issue presented to the court is whether or not plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to sustain a claim for enforcing an arbitration award when plaintiff has not alleged any wrongdoing by the union section  of the lmra provides jurisdiction for suits in the district court between labor organizations employers and employees for violations of collective bargaining agreements hines v anchor motor freight inc  us    s ct   l ed d   suits under §  encompass those seeking to vindicate uniquely personal rights of employees such as wages id quoting smith v evening news assn  us    s ct   l ed d   the eleventh circuit has addressed the required showing that the plaintiff in this case must make to prevail on his claim as the courts have made clear when an employee sues his employer under section  for breach of uniquely personal rights created by a collective bargaining agreement after the employer has settled the controversy with the employees union representative pursuant to binding grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement the employee is required in some way to show that the unions duty to represent him fairly  has been breached before he is entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim diaz v schwerman trucking co  fd   th cir quoting united parcel service inc v mitchell  us   s ct   l ed d   in diaz the eleventh circuit upheld the district courts denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the plaintiffemployee had alleged inter alia that the employer refused to comply with the arbitrators decision and that the union did not enforce the decision thereby breaching its duty of fair representation id at  the second circuit has also addressed the case where an employee brings suit to challenge an arbitration award holding if there is no claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation an individual employee represented by a union generally does not have standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding to which the union and the employer were the only parties plaintiff was not a party to the arbitration between the union and employer in addition nothing in plaintiffs petition supports a claim for breach of duty on the part of the union accordingly plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the award and her petition was properly dismissed katir v columbia univ  fd   nd cir  internal citations omitted the eighth circuit has also required a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation in failing to enforce the arbitration award in order for an employee to prevail against the employer livingstone v schnuck mkt inc  fd  th cir the seventh circuit has noted that there are two exceptions to this rule neither of which is applicable to the case at hand  in a similar factual case to the one at hand a court in this district recently affirmed the requirement that an employee must demonstrate bad faith on the part of the union to enforce an arbitration decision against the employer smoot v eagle energy inc civil action no   us dist lexis  sdw va knapp j see also cannelton indus inc v district  united mine workers of am  f supp d  sdwva haden cj in smoot the district court evaluated the complaint based on the katir principle that individual union members do not generally have standing under section  of the labor management relations act to challenge modify or confirm arbitration awards id the court then dismissed the action because plaintiff herein is not a party to the arbitration award and therefore cannot seek to enforce the award even though the award addresses plaintiffs recall rights id the court particularly relied on the fact that the union was contemporaneously seeking to enforce the arbitration through a separate legal action in much the same way as the union in the present case is doing through its grievance procedures plaintiff makes several arguments to support the adequacy of the complaint first plaintiff points out that the union and pechiney have agreed to an arbitration procedure for settling grievances plaintiff goes on to state naturally in signing the cba both pechiney and the union agreed to abide by the results of any arbitration award in this case the union has done so but pechiney has not because it has not mr sanders has a cause of action against pechiney for breach of contract plaintiffs memorandum in opposition to pechineys motion to dismiss at  emphasis added this is an inaccurate statement the cause of action in this case belongs to the union not to mr sanders because mr sanders was neither a party to the collective bargaining agreement nor to the arbitration as the fourth circuit has recently stated an individual employee represented by a union  generally does not have standing to challenge modify or confirm an arbitration award because he was not a party to the arbitration bryant v bell atl md inc  fd   th cir in bryant the fourth circuit affirmed the district courts grant of defendants motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff had not attempted to show that the union breached its duty of fair representation thus the court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to enforce the arbitration award id plaintiff also relies on williams v united states steel  f supp  ndind affd  fd  th cir in williams an employee brought suit under §  to enforce an arbitration award that the union secured on his behalf defendant moved for summary judgment arguing that the complaint was timebarred based on the sixmonth limitation announced in delcostello the court found that in the seventh circuit unions did not have a duty to enforce an arbitration award therefore the enforcement of the award is left to the employee through a straight §  suit not a hybrid  id at  this court declines to follow williams for two reasons first the holding in williams is contrary to the language discussed above in bryant which is the applicable law in this circuit second it is extremely unclear as to whether williams is even the governing law in the seventh circuit in cleveland v porca co   fd  th cir the seventh circuit was presented with a group of employees who sued to enforce an arbitration order under §  the employees filed suit against the employer for violation of the collective bargaining agreement and against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation the seventh circuit first analyzed the claim against the union and found no breach of duty id at  the court went on to analyze the claim against the employer holding the plaintiffs lack standing to enforce the arbitration award however because when employees are represented by a union they are not parties to either the collective bargaining agreement or any union company arbitration the plaintiffs also cannot maintain a claim against the employer under section  for breach of the collective bargaining agreement to state such a claim the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the employer breached the collective bargaining agreement and that the union violated its duty of fair representation id at  this court is inclined to follow the holding of the seventh circuit rather than a district court therein particularly since bryant refers to and applies this language next plaintiff relies on teamsters local union no  v keal driveaway co  fd  th cir plaintiff singularly relies on keal driveaways discussion of the hybrid suit wherein the court stated it is true that an employee or local union may maintain separate actions for distinct injuries resulting from an employers breach of contract and a unions breach of its duty of representation in the handling of a subsequent grievance id at  this statement is inapplicable to plaintiffs argument first keal driveaway involved a motion to dismiss based on the failure to join a necessary party where a union which lost an arbitration sued the employer but not the union that won the arbitration the issue was failure to add a necessary party not standing to bring the action furthermore the above quoted language only allows for suits to be brought by either an employee or a local union against both the employer and the union the language does not however preempt the requirements of a suit by sanders against pechiney one of which is to allege breach of duty of fair representation against the union see delcostello  us at   s ct  finally plaintiff relies on wilks v american bakeries co  f supp  wdnc plaintiff argues that wilks is a factually similar case in which the employee was allowed to bring suit against the employer wilks however is not at all like the present case because in wilks both the employee and the union filed suit against the employer under §  there is no question that §  allows suits by unions against employers to enforce arbitration agreements in the present case not only is the union a defendant but sanders has specifically denied any breach of a duty of fair representation by the union wilks does not inform the present question plaintiff argues that it seems bizarre to allow repeated arbitrations to settle disputes over the enforcement of previous awards plaintiffs remedy is to bring a suit against pechiney and allege a breach by the union if he believes the union is breaching its duty of fair representation by failing to seek enforcement of a favorable arbitration award this would prevent plaintiffs russian dolls hypothetical wherein an endless string of arbitrations is required to enforce a single decision as noted during argument however the union is grieving the plaintiffs claim that his firing was improper and a pretext to circumvent the arbitrators award  iv count ii of the complaint alleges that pechineys failure to reinstate plaintiff pursuant to the arbitration decision constitutes an unfair labor practice pursuant to  usc §  pechiney argues that this court does not have jurisdiction over this count because the national labor relations board has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim plaintiff argues that since arbitration awards are enforced in federal courts then this claim can also be heard in federal court plaintiff is again incorrect as discussed above plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to maintain its claim to enforce the arbitration decision therefore if count ii merely alleges damages based on pechineys alleged refusal to implement the decision then this count is repetitive and must also be dismissed if as plaintiff seems to argue this is a wholly separate count then its jurisdiction must be separately assessed the supreme court has recently summarized the law with respect to federal court jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims when a plaintiff challenges an action that is arguably subject to §  or §  of the nlra this challenge is within the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb but when a plaintiff alleges a breach of the duty of fair representation this claim is cognizable in the first instance in federal court the qualificationif her challenge is a duty of fair representation claimis important the ritualistic incantation of the phrase duty of fair representation is insufficient to invoke the primary jurisdiction of federal courts as we noted in beck employees may not circumvent the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb simply by casting statutory claims as violations of the unions duty of fair representation when a plaintiffs only claim is that the union violated the nlra the plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdiction of the nlrb by characterizing this alleged statutory violation as a breach of the duty of fair representation to invoke federal jurisdiction when the claim is based in part on a violation of the nlra there must be something more than just a claim that the union violated the statute the plaintiff must adduce facts suggesting that the unions violation of the statute was arbitrary discriminatory or in bad faith  the power of federal courts to resolve statutory issues under the nlra when they arise as collateral matters in a duty of fair representation suit does not open the door for federal court first instance resolution of all statutory claims federal courts can only resolve §  and §  claims that are collateral to a duty of fair representation claim marquez v screen actors guild  us    s ct   l ed d   citing san diego bldg trades council v garmon  us    s ct   l ed d   vaca v sipes  us    s ct   l ed d   communications workers of am v beck  us   s ct   l ed d   just as the supreme court has not allowed the bootstrapping of unfair labor practice claims by relabeling them as a breach of the duty of fair representation this court will not allow identical bootstrapping by plaintiffs characterization of his claim as enforcing an arbitration award plaintiffs count ii relies solely on  usc §  which is one of two sections that garmon declares to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb see garmon  us at   s ct  plaintiff has failed to state a claim against pechiney to enforce the arbitration award this court is not fooled by plaintiffs semantics and an examination of the specific paragraphs of  count ii
