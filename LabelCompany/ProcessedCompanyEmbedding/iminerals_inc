states iminerals trueqtm quartz performs well in glaze and fusion testing mar   iminerals lnc reported the results of recent research that confirms the excellent quality of the companys high purity quartz products recent testing by a ceramic manufacturer confirmed the iminerals trueqtm is a desirable product for use in ceramic glazes as a clear transparent glaze formed during testing in addition iminerals achieved excellent results from a recent sodalimesilicate glass fusion confirming trueqtm produces a more water white or less colored glass as compared with another western quartz product the results of this work not only support the low fe values but also discovered the clarity of the quartz is as clear as the color a heavy liquid separation was completed using a certified analytical company and showed heavy minerals were below detection in the trueqtm products this research in addition to specific wet and dry processing techniques preserves the physical particle size distribution and quality aspects of the product which sets company apart from the incumbent producer iminerals has developed different grades of quartz trueqtm  sio and its high purity trueqtm  sio currently research is underway to investigate the geologic deposits of the helmerbovill property for areas that may also have areas of low titanium these test results confirm trueqtm is well suited for use in the solar glass specialty glass display glass fine ceramics and glaze markets while opportunities exist for trueqtm as a feedstock for certain ultrahigh purity quartz applications and potentially the sodium silicate manufacturing industries based on analytical testing to date a small reduction in titanium will open up additional higher value markets including fiber optics and led lighting

basic flotation of primary clay material vancouver bc july    iminerals inc tsxvima  us otc imahf announces it has received initial results from dorfner anzaplan “dorfner” a specialty quartz testing laboratory in germany dorfner’s initial work included a detailed analysis of the quartz product derived from the primary clay material from the company’s bovill kaolin project the material was first processed at ginn mineral research in sandersville georgia wherein the clay fraction kaolin  halloysite was separated from the sand fraction feldspar  quartz the sand fraction was then sent to minerals research laboratory at north carolina state university “mrl” where four quartz products were created using a multiple flotation techniques a  mesh one float product “ f ” a finer grind  mesh one float product “ f ” a  mesh two float product “ f ” and a  mesh three float product “ f ” dorfner completed analysis of each of the four samples with the results as follows  f   f   f   f  total impurities ppm     sio purity     high pure quartz products have total impurities less than  parts per million “ppm” or greater than  sio all of the  mesh products tested by dorfner reported total impurities of  ppm or less the purity levels achieved after the single and second float are some of the best results achieved to date at least  of impurities are attributable to alkna indicating there is likely trace amounts of feldspar in the quartz product high pure quartz products are used in a variety of applications including solar glass specialty chemicals manufacturing and optical applications including fibre optics various applications required different specifications for total element content iminerals is undertaking additional analysis for less common elements to confirm the quartz product is acceptable into a variety of markets and applications the company has commissioned dorfner to undertake a series of leach testing to see how much further the trace elements can be reduced with these results we have now produced high pure quartz from both the granitoid ores of our kelly’s basin deposit and the primary clay from the neighboring bovill kaolin project” commented thomas conway president and ceo of iminerals inc ”to have achieved this level of purity through basic flotation leaves the company well positioned to be a low cost producer of high purity quartz products and naturally we are all very encouraged with these results” a lamar long cpg is the qualified person “qp” for the helmerbovill project under ni  he oversees the quality control and quality assurance program and the construction of all samples for metallurgical analysis and reviews all analytical results prior to public release about iminerals inc iminerals holds ten minerals leases in northwestern idaho that hosts kelly’s basin feldsparquartz deposit that is the subject of an ongoing feasibility study  high purity quartz  sio can be produced through a standard flotation process a prefeasibility study completed by srk consulting usa inc of denver co “srk” calculated a npv of  million and an irr of  preliminary exploration work on occurrences of primary clay deposits has identified variable concentrations of kaolinite halloysite quartz and feldspar the company commissioned srk to complete and initial assessment of the primary clay deposits through a preliminary economic assessment the “pea” which is based upon limited widely spaced drilling over large areas while additional assessment work is required to fully assess the economic viability of the deposits the pea yielded a npv of  million and an irr of  and indicated these primary clay deposits may represent the largest deposit of halloysite in north america halloysite is a unique tubular shaped

deposit is hosted in a border zone of the unweathered thatuna granodiorite within a lobe of the idaho batholith iminerals has identified an initial resource of  million tons of thatuna granodiorite estimated to contain  million tons of feldspar and  million tons of quartz in december  iminerals completed a prefeasibility study on the kelly’s basin deposit which contemplated the joint mining of kelly’s basin and the wbl tailings extensive metallurgical testing repeatedly demonstrates iminerals can produce a high quality sodium feldspar “naspar” and high purity quartz products  sio  as part of the prefeasibility process the kelly’s basin mill facility was designed to produce both high quality feldspar and quartz products through a standard flotation process and high pure quartz products through multistage flotation as designed the flotation circuit would not discharge water which when coupled with the benign nature of the ores mined would be expected to have limited environmental impact on the surrounding areahowever when compared with the economic assessment of the kelly’s basin deposit the bovill kaolin deposits appear to have a higher value mineral product mix a superior npv and irr lower initial capital costs and a shorter payback period accordingly the bovill kaolin deposits will be the focus of iminerals efforts in the near term with the kelly’s basin deposit to be

mortars it causes an aggressive reaction with calcium hydroxide lime to form compounds with enhanced performance characteristics including increased strength reduced permeability greater durability effective control of efflorescence and control of degradation caused by alkalisilica reaction the quality of a metakaolin is determined by i the amount of lime it is able to bind ii the velocity at which the hydrated lime is reacted iii the mechanical properties of mortars and concrete and iv the color whiter metakaolin can be more easily colored iminerals will move its kaolin into metakaolin market under the brand name bovill metakaolin long term testing by a leading cement laboratory has demonstrated its initial metakaolin product performed at least as well as fly ash a more common pozzolan in the pacific northwest bovill metakaolin has a finer particle size than iminerals’ initial metakaolin product and is now generating pozzolanic results more comparable with higher cost pozzolans such as silica fume at present there is no metakaolin production in the pacific northwest and transportation costs to bring a georgia sourced metakaolin make it a high priced pozzolan fly ash lower cost and generally inferior pozzolan compared to metakaolin is coming under ever increasing environmental pressures presenting a significant market opportunity for imineral’s bovill metakaolin uses beyond standard ceramic applications other uses for kaolin include paper coating filler paint plastics fiberglass catalysts and other specialty applications it is also used as a key ingredient in natural pesticides that are suitable for organic farming applications iminerals however will focus almost exclusively on the metakaolin markets a bridge deck in a northern climate where it is subject to the wear and tear associated with plowing and salting is a prime metakaolin application for more information bovill metakaolin overview transportation feldspar quartz kaolin

silicon dioxide is crystalline silica the second most common mineral in the crust of the earth it is well known for its hardness and its use in glass however different types of glass require different sio purity levels with the most basic flat glass eg house windows only requiring sio purities of about  while more complex glass such as solar glass or lcd glass have desired purities in excess of  sio although silicon dioxide is abundant not all deposits are chemically exact with the sio purity and the levels of various trace element impurities varying across different deposits contamination of quartz can be from mineral and fluid inclusions and nonsilica elements entering atomic sites usually occupied by silicon and oxygen iminerals is developing three quartz products under the trueqtm that offer different sio purities and each product will be available in a variety of grinds trueqtm is a single float  sio product trueqtm is a twice floated  sio product and trueqtm is a thrice floated  sio product uses higher value applications for quartz products the company is targeting include sodium silicate fused silica epoxy molding compounds square quartz crucibles for polysilicon manufacture halogen fluorescent and xenon lamps quartz for making fused silica grain specialty ceramic glazes paint solar glass optical glass art glass glass bulbs liquid crystal display lcd glass fused silica grain is a raw material for square silica crucibles used to produce directionally solidified polycrystalline solar cells ppm of ti is limiting the use of trueq in mainstream led and fibre optic applications but iminerals is undertaking additional testing to see how much ti can be removed and in the interim it is examining quartz fibers and quartz tubes that are doped with titanium for optical andor catalyst application eg lasers and tanning lights for more information trueq®g float glass product trueq®    mesh trueq®  sio overview transportation feldspar quartz kaolin halloysite
