for your interest in learning more about seres therapeutics’ clinical trials below we’ve included information on our science and technology and on why clinical trials are important to helping us bring treatments that are safe and effective to patients what is the microbiome the microbiome refers to the trillions of small organisms that live in or on your body for a long time scientists and doctors didn’t realize the important role the microbiome played in keeping humans healthy in the last decade the scientific community has begun to understand just how the microbiome helps to keep our bodies healthy by fighting germs resisting disease and absorbing nutrients from the food we eat to name just a few examples seres has been studying the gut microbiome as a way to understand the treatment of disease we believe that certain diseases flourish in bodies that have an imbalanced or disrupted microbiome a condition known as dysbiosis and that by developing medicines that treat dysbiosis directly we are able to help bodies return to a healthy state click here to read more about the microbiome on our website our science and technology seres takes a new approach to the way we develop our therapeutic medicines our scientists study data from healthy microbiomes and compare them with microbiomes that have dysbiosis and are associated with a disease state by comparing these data and combining them with a deep understanding of the functional characteristics of different microbes we are able to empirically identify alterations in the microbiome of healthy individuals that result in the disrupted diseased microbiomes we then use our proprietary drug development platform to design and formulate compositions of microbes that deliver the missing functions back to the gut by reestablishing these metabolic and immunological functions we have been able to show that we can treat disease click here to read more about our science and technology on our website what are clinical trials and why should i participate clinical trials are an important step in the drug development process they help to ensure that our medicines are safe and effective the food and drug administration fda the government organization that regulates medicines in the united states will review the results of our clinical trials and decide whether to approve our medicines to be made available to the public for many patients who have found the usual course of treatment ineffective clinical trials are an opportunity to be a part of the testing process for an investigational drug some patients may find that the investigational drug is more effective than other treatments they have tried by taking part in clinical trials patients can make an important contribution to ongoing research and to better understanding of a disease our current clinical disease targets clostridium difficile infection cdi our program ser is developing a treatment to prevent recurring clostridium difficile infection cdi clostridium difficile is a bacteria that can cause unpleasant and sometimes serious symptoms including frequent loose watery bowel movements diarrhea and stomach pain approximately  americans die from cdi each year cdi most frequently occurs after a patient has received an antibiotic typically within a hospital setting antibiotics are given to destroy harmful bacteria that cause disease but occasionally can also destroy helpful bacteria that fight harmful bacteria such as clostridium difficile we are evaluating ser and ser in cdi click here to read more about our cdi programs

reaction to important study results that missed the mark brian feroldi tmftypeoh jul   at pm image source getty images what shares of seres therapeutics nasdaqmcrb a clinicalstage biotech focused on developing microbiome technology are collapsing today down more than  as of noon edt on huge volume in response to the news that an important clinical study didnt go according to plan so what seres therapeutics released interim results from its ecospor study today which was testing its lead product candidate ser as a potential treatment for the bacterium clostridium difficile or c diff  the patient placebocontrolled phase  study was attempting to show that using ser could reduce the relative risk of c diff infection cdi recurrence unfortunately the companys interim data that were collected at week eight of the study showed ser has failed to meet its primary objective specifically cdi recurrence was observed in  of patients who used ser compared to  of patients who used a placebo even though the result for seres product was slightly better it was not high enough to be statistically significant seres therapeutics ceo roger pomerantz offered up this commentary on the disappointing study results these are unexpected clinical results in view of the positive data in our prior investigatorsponsored phase b trial as well as in a wide range of supporting clinical and preclinical data specifically the recurrence rates observed in the overall ser treatment group in the age stratified subgroups and in the placebo groups are inconsistent with our expectations our priority is to complete a full review of the clinical results and microbiome data of the phase  study and to compare it to data from the prior investigator sponsored phase b based on this information and pending discussions with the fda we plan to make any necessary changes to our development plans for ser now what ser was the companys most advanced product candidate so its no surprise to see seres shares getting wiped out today  if youre looking for a silver lining here the study hinted that ser may still hold promise as a treatment for older adults specially subjects who were older than  and used ser experienced cdi recurrence in only  of cases which compared favorably to the  recurrence observed in the placebo group still that number was from a much smaller patient population so its possible that the result occurred purely by chance in addition ser performed far worse with the younger patient population ser was associated with cdi recurrence in  of subjects under age  versus only  in the placebo group seres therapeutics stock has put investors on a rough ride since first hitting the public markets in june  even prior to todays collapse shares trailed the poorly performing

how you can learn more about clinician and patient participation in clinical trials what is the microbiome’s role in human health discoveries made over the past decade have radically reshaped clinical understanding of the role that the human microbiome plays in regulating human health once seen only in adversarial terms today the trillions of bacteria that inhabit or live on our bodies are known to play important beneficial roles in a wide range of biological processes including resistance to pathogens regulation of immune function and energy metabolism seres is leading a paradigm shift in the understanding and treatment of human diseases that result from functional deficiencies of the human microbiome a condition known as dysbiosis we believe the microbiome holds great promise for patients whose conditions are not served by current approaches click here to read more about the microbiome how does this new approach to treating disease work rather than take aim at traditional disease targets our microbiome therapeutics platform is designed to find and fix functional deficiencies that derive from a disrupted microbiome and that that give rise to a given disease early data from our lead clinical program in recurrent c difficile infection suggests that this approach can lead to unprecedented clinical efficacy our proprietary discovery and design platform enables us to elucidate how changes in the composition of microbes in a disrupted dysbiotic microbiome relate to alterations in the metabolic and immunological function of the microbiome and to design and empirically optimize ecobiotic® drugs that disrupt the diseased microbiome and catalyze the repair of the microbiome improving health click here to learn more about our microbiome therapeutics platform our
