heavyduty trucks for longhaul shortradius distribution and construction site operations the portfolio is rounded off with a range of specialpurpose vehicles including for municipal operations the art of engineering the most beautiful form of art for us at daimler trucks as technology leader we aspire to shape the future of transport actively after all it is clear that the haulage sector will continue to grow sharply over the next few decades here the challenges we face as a manufacturer are formidable more than ever there is a need to reconcile the demands of the environment and the economy – and that can only be achieved through innovations latest testimony to our technology leadership comes in the shape of our autonomous mercedesbenz future truck  or also the first autonomous truck licensed for use on public roads in nevadausa the freightliner inspiration truck furthermore we have sent the mercedesbenz actros with highway pilot the worlds first autonomous seriesproduction truck out onto a german motorway we offer our customers the leadingedge technologies that they need for their business to be successful when it comes to efficiency safety and connectivity we lead the way and continue to raise the bar in these areas we are constantly working on new technologies which provide our customers with financial benefits and promote societys interests fuel consumption is a key factor in determining a trucks overall running costs – making it a decisive purchasing argument for our customers thats why we take full advantage of the technological possibilities of further reducing the fuel consumption of our trucks compared with the previous actros model the average consumption has been cut by up to  percent since  thanks to the introduction of the new actros the predictive powertrain control system and the new engine generation we are also a pioneer in the area of safety having added a host of key innovations for active and passive safety to our vehicles the blind spot monitoring system for instance warns truck drivers when turning not only of other road users but also of imminent collisions with stationary obstacles such as traffic lights or road signs while it may still be some time before autonomous trucks are approved for usage on public roads worldwide connectivity is already a routine part of daily life for many longdistance drivers the usage of stateoftheart telematics systems offers fleet operators major benefits overall they benefit from lower fuel consumption and higher vehicle availability telematics is therefore a key component in
