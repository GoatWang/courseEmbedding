rfsuny business wire mar    am est kyto biopharma inc “kyto” otcbb kbph is pleased to announce that it has signed a licensing agreement with the research foundation of the state university of new york “rfsuny” the licensing agreement grants kyto patent rights to the transcobalamin vitamin b  receptor and to an additional broad group of other patents which are critical to kyto’s research and development strategy for the treatment of cancer kyto scientists have isolated and cloned the transcobalamin receptor which has been shown to be over expressed in various forms of cancer the primary therapeutic approach developed by kyto is directed at the selective targeting of the transcobalamin receptor in cancer cells by monoclonal antibodies this approach intends to minimize many of the potential complications arising from current chemotherapy treatments such as acute systemic toxicity to date kyto has been successful in developing specific murine monoclonal antibodies to the transcobalamin receptor a candidate antibody identified as mabtcr has been demonstrated to be effective in targeting cancer cells and in inhibiting cell proliferation in a number of cell lines including solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies the conjugation of the mabtcr antibody to saporin a highly effective intracellular cytotoxic agent did not affect the biological activity of the antibody the mabtcr – saporin conjugate demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in a spectrum of cancer cell lines the licensing agreement is a critical milestone for kyto and is the culmination of over  years of research and development funding provided by kyto to the state university of new york suny the suny group based in brooklyn and headed by dr edward quadros and dr jeffrey sequeira has been focused on targeting the vitamin b  pathway for the treatment of cancer georges benarroch president and ceo of kyto complemented the suny scientists and rfsuny for their invaluable contributions to and support of kyto for over a decade “kyto is currently developing a humanized version of the mabtcr antibody as it advances its candidate product towards the clinic” stated dr uri sagman cofounder

monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of various forms of cancer the kyto research and development program is conducted by the state university of new york suny brooklyn kyto is currently engaged in the development of a portfolio of potential targeted biologic treatments based on i antibodydrug conjugates adcs to target the delivery of cytotoxins to cancer cells via the coupling of saporin or other cytotoxic payloads to mabs that are internalized after binding to the vitamin b receptor ii monoclonal antibodies mabs to block the vitamin b uptake to cancer cells iii sirna oligonucleotides designed to downregulateinhibit the cancer cells ability to express the vitamin b receptor leading to cell death vitamin b regulates one of two major cellular pathways for the production of folates the progenitor for the synthesis of dna cancer cells require increased levels of vitamin b for proliferation than do normal cells and in turn overexpress the receptor for the uptake of vitamin b kyto is targeting the overexpression of the vitamin b receptor in the treatment of various forms of cancer the primary approach developed by kyto is directed at selective targeting of the vitamin b receptor in cancer cells by monoclonal antibodies the kyto technology is intended to exploit overexpression of vitamin b receptors in cancer cells by coupling toxins such as saporin to monoclonal antibodies that directly target the vitamin b receptor and are internalized thereby releasing the toxin directly within the tumor cells kytos portfolio consists of molecules at the

disclosure during the quarter ended december   we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the  act based on this evaluation because of the company’s limited resources and limited number of employees management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of december   limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include but are not limited to the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended december
