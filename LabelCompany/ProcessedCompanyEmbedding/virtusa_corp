the globe it services a diverse set of industries including banking financial services insurance healthcare telecom and media the company offers a wide range of business services including erp solutions and cloud services it’s poised to capitalize on the growing technology needs of global companies virtusa moved out of its bottom and is moving sideways a monthly chart of vrtu shows that it completed an intermediateterm bottom last year it’s been stuck in a sideways pattern right at the bottom completion level though the monthly chart also shows that vrtu’s alltime high is at  so it has plenty of room to move up from its current position figure  monthly chart of vrtu chart provided by freestockchartscom the weekly chart of vrtu gives us a closer look at the current sideways pattern the stock has moved sideways for almost all of  notably there are some large black candles where highfrequency traders hft jumped in to drive the stock down the trend was also slowly slipping down

control during this recent sideways action figure  weekly chart of vrtu chart provided by freestockchartscom we should also check the daily chart to see what the stock is currently up to right now the stock is trending back up to the highs of the sideways pattern the candles look stronger and lack indecisive wicks or tails we can also see that hfts tried to sell the stock down on  but couldnt drive it down very far so some large investment firm’s buy zone is likely nearby overall the current volume is low with mostly green bars and a few red spikes green volume has dominated more over the past couple of weeks though overall the patterns in the charts show that some buyers are carefully moving into this stock but there’s not a lot of momentum in it right now figure  daily chart of vrtu chart provided by freestockchartscom virtusa has grown strongly over the past year the charts show that there could be some potential for this stock but do the company’s fundamentals back up what we see in the charts we can find out by checking the companys financials firstly the income statement shows that virtusa’s revenues have grown strongly over the past year in fact revenues have increased over the past  quarters and that revenue growth is accelerating net income hasn’t grown as consistently however income fell badly in the first quarter of fiscal year  the drop was largely due to the acquisition of polaris consulting and the resulting restructuring of the company since then however income has steadily climbed over the last three quarters costs are rising in tandem with revenues but at a much slower pace overall it looks like virtusa is making an effort to control its costs and its financials look very strong figure  income statement for vrtu data provided by google finance virtusa has a moderate amount of longterm debt that debt slowly declined over that past  quarters though so the company is controlling its debt load its current ratio is  however which is a little on the high side so the company may not be using its assets efficiently figure  balance sheet for vrtu data provided by google finance institutional holdings of vrtu is at  which is very high the data from nasdaqcom shows that more institutions have sold or lowered their holdings though figure  institutional activity for vrtu but three of the top holders for vrtu are giant funds including one giant bank these funds are adding to or maintaining their positions in vrtu a quick glance at this data shows that’s likely just smaller and less experienced funds moving out of this stock the larger and more experienced funds seem to expect this stock to continue upwards figure  institutional holders for vrtu virtusa’s last earnings report shows slower growth so far virtusa’s financials look promising but can it continue to grow at this pace let’s look at the last earnings report and find out the management commentary was very positive and aggressive in the fourth quarter fiscal year  report chief financial officer ranjan kalia stated “we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin accretion in the fourth quarter our q nongaap eps was below the midpoint of our guidance range primarily due to a shift forward of certain expenses in our cost of sales looking to fiscal  we expect to deliver aboveindustry revenue growth as well as continued margin accretion even after absorbing inr headwinds of approximately  basis points” the company’s expectations for the next quarter however are lackluster virtusa expects revenues of  to  million according to earningswhisperscom analysts expect revenues closer to  million that’s pretty flat compared to last quarter’s  million the company also expects earnings per share of just  to  analysts expect slightly higher earnings per share of  but both estimates are significantly lower than last quarter’s earnings per share of  virtusa is expected to report around august th so we’ll see then how the company fared in the first quarter of fiscal year  virtusa expects better results for the full fiscal year  though annual revenues are expected to be in the range of  to  million analysts expect the company to hit above the midpoint of its guidance at  million this would be a  increase over last year it doesnt match the strong revenue growth the company experienced last year but it’s still respectable annual earnings per share are expected in the range of  to  but analysts expect virtusa to hit above this range at  but even the company’s lower estimates represent a nice jump over last year’s earnings per share of  so it looks like virtusa expects to keep costs down and grow its earnings throughout fiscal year  conclusion vrtu moved up nicely out of its recent bottom on strongly improving revenues it’s stuck in a sideways range right now though its fiscal year  financials were strong overall although earnings lagged due to restructuring costs related to an acquisition it looks like revenues won’t climb as strongly this year although income should greatly improve due to lower costs revenues and earnings look like they’ll both dip in the fiscal first quarter however so if this stock is of interest consider waiting to enter until later in the year also hold off on entering the stock until it moves beyond the highs of its sideways range at  overall this stock shows some promise thanks to its interesting product offerings and a growing market disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote
