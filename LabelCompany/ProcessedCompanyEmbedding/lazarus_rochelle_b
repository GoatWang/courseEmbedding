external advisory council lazarus received an undergraduate degree from smith college and an mba from columbia university company brief ogilvy  mather wwwogilvycom based in new york is one of the largest marketing communications networks in the world with more than  offices in  countries specializing in advertising relationship and interactive marketing public relations sales promotion and related services the agency services fortune global  companies including american express bp cisco cocacola dupont ford glaxosmithkline ibm kimberlyclark kraft mattel motorola nestlé sap unilever and yum brands inc ogilvy  mather is a subsidiary of wpp group plc this company understood community engagement early on how critical is that at a time when corporate responsibility is being heavily promoted it has been part of our core and culture what is lucky for us is that what we know how to do fits so perfectly in the world of philanthropy you almost can’t create a movement or drive a mission for the world without great communications so we’ve had an obvious central role in the world of corporate citizenship from the very start it has been less about writing checks and more about contributing our time attention passion and skills to causes all over the world and covering almost every field of endeavor it is also so motivating to the staff to take what you know how to do professionally and apply it to something you believe in works magic on the way you feel about your professional life is there a real shift today in drawing the line between business and philanthropy the line is completely blurred – it’s not even about philanthropy but about citizenship there is an expectation now that companies will behave as responsible citizens of the local and global community so ge’s ecomagination was something you could argue is of enormous value to the quality of the environment but it also has an economic imperative because all ge customers are trying to do more with less therefore ge is making products to satisfy their customers’ needs but those customer needs are all about having products that are friendlier to the environment it’s a wonderful virtuous circle now and what might have been considered philanthropy  years ago is not philanthropy at all – it’s smart business do shareholders understand that transition and how it has evolved the enlightened ones do most companies i know proclaim they are market driven the market has spoken and the market cares what the ethos is of a company those who demonstrate that they don’t care about their role in society and the contribution they make are marked down for it is it important that the citizenship efforts align with the business strategy and are there examples where it has worked effectively absolutely there are so many examples the most obvious being ronald mcdonald house so much of mcdonald’s business comes from providing healthy meals for children so giving back for them means helping children who have health issues cocacola’s focus on water is another one as well as avon’s focus on breast cancer and domestic violence avon sees itself as not just making products that sell to women but being about an affirmation of women’s role in society and women’s independence ecomagination comes out of what ge does and the dove selfesteem fund for young women comes from dove’s focus on helping the world understand what real beauty is dupont worked with a town in north carolina to rebuild their infrastructure after a tornado but in a sustainable way so they contributed dupont sustainable products – it was like a live product demo of the future of dupont’s rd efforts in sustainability the world has moved beyond writing checks to having all the giving back to the community come out of the heart of what the company does that’s so much more potent because you’re dealing with the economic power of the entire enterprise – not just the philanthropy budget for a company like ogilvy with a number of resources around the world is it tough to sometimes have to say no to certain causes it is but if there is someone within this company who believes strongly in a certain enterprise and wants to devote his personal time to helping that organization figure out how to communicate and motivate people better i don’t stand in the way so these become individual choices but without a champion within the agency it won’t work we have another great advantage these days because so much of our client activities are focused on these efforts that have societal impact so you don’t have to beg for philanthropy when you work on dove for instance you’re working on selfesteem for young women it’s not what you do late at night it’s your day job are young people today looking for a philanthropic company culture absolutely it used to close the sale to people who were coming into the company but now we start with it and the younger you are the more it matters no matter how large this company has grown the values are never lost what is it about ogilvy that has made it work so well we were lucky because we had a founder who laid out a culture before he had any clients he was a great copywriter so it was expressed in a way that once you heard it you could not help but remember it strong cultures tend to attract people who are taken with the culture and repel people for whom the culture doesn’t resonate so it’s a selfperpetuating machine because the stronger your culture is the stronger it continues to be because you immediately know when you walk in the door as a potential employee if this is the right place for you and vice versa is the business still exciting for you every time you go to a new client with a new set of opportunities problems or issues it’s like having a new job that’s what keeps me fresh• click here to download a pdf of an interview with rochelle b lazarus chairman ogilvy  mather see other features from leaders magazines april may june

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
