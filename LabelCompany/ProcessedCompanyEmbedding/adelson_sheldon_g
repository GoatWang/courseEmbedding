plans to publish a free daily newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election

newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the

tougher about irans suspected nuclear weapons program controversy arose when he said you pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say ok let it go and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and

newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the largest donor to donald trumps white house bid adelsons newspaper the las vegas reviewjournal was the first and only major newspaper nationwide to endorse trump adelson was also the largest donor to trumps inaugural celebrations with a  million donation to the celebrations us policy on iranedit in a panel discussion at yeshiva university on october   adelson said that the united states must get tougher about irans suspected nuclear weapons program controversy arose when he said you pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say ok let it go and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on tehran the us should then say if you iran want to be peaceful just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes energy purposes adelsons spokesman told reporters that adelson was obviously not speaking literally about using an atomic bomb in the desert and that he was using hyperbole to make a point

adelson told forbes magazine that he is against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections but as long as its doable im going to do it because i know that guys like soros have been doing it for years if not decades and they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money i have my own philosophy and im not ashamed of it i gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it i dont want to go through ten different corporations to hide my name im proud of what i do and im not looking to escape recognition edit in  adelson and his wife

newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the

 he recovered his initial million investment in one year and because he owns  of the stock he increased his wealth when he took the stock public in december  since the opening of the sands macao adelsons personal wealth has multiplied more than fourteen times in august  adelson opened the billion venetian macao resort hotel on cotai and announced that he planned to create a massive concentrated resort area he called the cotai strip after its las vegas counterpart adelson said that he planned to open more hotels under brands such as four seasons sheraton and st regis his las vegas sands planned to invest  billion and build  hotel rooms on the cotai strip by  adelsons company was reportedly under federal investigation over alleged violations of the foreign corrupt

clubs and  luxury hotel rooms israeli pressedit in  adelson made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the israeli newspaper maariv when this failed he proceeded with parallel plans to publish a free daily newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the

weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and

entrepreneurship embodies the spirit of innovation and transformative thinking central to its mission the plan is efficient and modular with tall spaces designed to be conveniently reconfigured to support a variety of teaching environments the building is an extended metaphor for the entrepreneurial mindset  clear straightforward no frills while simultaneously assertive dynamic passionately creative and humane save this picture  amit geron the design of the building promotes an idea that the school can be read as both a conceptual and literal factory for the production of creativity and collaborative pursuits however unlike a actual factory that deals strictly with the efficient processing of materials into useful objects the raw materials of this school are people who want to work together collaboratively efficiently and in a spirit of opportunity and inspiration save this picture  amit geron the factory is conceptual in the use ofthe modular reconfigurable  meter wide

façade shading – italfim exa  expanded metal mesh xpmthe glazed west façade is protected with a series of vertical sun louvers that baffle the strong afternoon sun while both promoting views of the campus landscapes and allowing natural light to penetrate deep into the building the design uses  identical vertical louver units made from painted steel and aluminum xpm mesh each unit is  meters high and  meters deep spaced  cm apart the architects strategically selected the appropriate mesh pattern and orientation thereby creating a simple smart filter for the sun light with the blades of the mesh turning slightly to the north the mesh blocks the light coming from the southwest while permitting views straight on and to the northwest a small amount of diffuse and reflected light still penetrates from the southwest giving the louver system a lightness and airiness save this picture  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit geron  amit

which raised  million twice as much money as any other inaugurationthe stream of money is a striking contrast to the way mr trump funded his campaign chiefly with small donations and his own fortune while some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime trump friends and associates much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding washington influence

said fred wertheimer the president of the watchdog group democracy  and a longtime advocate of tighter campaign finance rules “he also said he knew from personal experience that you can buy influence

have stood to gain as much under mr trump as private prison operators and they gave generously to his inauguration two of the largest such companies the corrections corporation of america now known as corecivic and the geo group each contributed since then the outlook for both companies has greatly improved in february attorney general jeff sessions rescinded an obamaera order that would have phased out the use of such prisons by the justice department and mr trump directed his administration to prioritize the detention and deportation of unauthorized immigrants proposing hundreds of

in mr trump’s circle after making the donation he earned a coveted spot at the chairman’s global dinner a preinauguration blacktie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps a photo from the event shows mr zuberi in conversation with mr trump and other guestsmr zuberi did not return a phone call seeking commentbecause inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaign fundraising each administration sets its own restrictionsgeorge w bush for example capped gifts at  for his first inaugural and at  for his second mr obama accepted gifts up to only  in  while banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether he loosened those restrictions in  accepting corporate gifts up to  million and individual gifts up to mr trump set comparatively loose restrictions he did not limit how much individuals could give and his team said it would not solicit corporate donations over  millionperhaps no donors were granted greater access than the adelson family mr trump singled out mr adelson and his wife to thank them for their support during a luncheon honoring congressional republicans on inauguration eve the next morning the pair sat along the aisle just a few rows back from mr trump on the inaugural platform as he took the oath of office mr mercer and his daughter rebekah sat some rows farther back a representative of mr adelson had no commentjust what other perks and souvenirs their donations helped pay for will probably remain a mystery while donations must be reported the federal election commission does not

republicans familiar with mr adelson’s plans spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publiclymr adelson’s pledge to mr trump the presumptive republican presidential nominee comes at an opportune time mr trump has relied on a mix of his own wealth and smalldollar contributions to finance his primary effort and lacks the sort of major donor network needed to sustain him in the general election mr trump has said that he may need  billion for the campaign but has only recently begun scheduling fundraisers and hiring finance staff members many of the republican party’s wealthiest contributors including the billionaire brothers charles g and david h koch have indicated they are unlikely to give to his candidacywhat remains unclear is how mr adelson plans to contribute his money to mr trump he will give the maximum allowed to mr trump’s campaign and the republican national committee but to spend the amount he contemplates would require donating

 weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the largest donor to donald trumps white house bid adelsons newspaper the las vegas reviewjournal was the first and only major newspaper nationwide to endorse trump adelson was also the largest donor to trumps inaugural celebrations with a  million donation to the celebrations us policy on iranedit in a panel discussion at yeshiva university on october   adelson said that the united states must get tougher about irans suspected nuclear weapons program controversy arose when he said you pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say ok let it go and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on tehran the us should then say if you iran want to be peaceful just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes energy purposes adelsons spokesman told reporters that adelson was obviously not speaking literally about using an atomic bomb in the desert and that he was using hyperbole to make a point that … actions speak louder than

majority leader tom delay rtx about a bill proposed by representative tom lantos d that would have prevented the us olympic committee from voting in favor of the chinese bid to host the  summer olympics a few hours later delay called back and told adelson he could tell the mayor of beijing this bill will never see the light of day the resolution did not pass adelson testified in court that

correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the

newspaper to compete with israeli a newspaper he had cofounded in  but had left the first edition of the new newspaper israel hayom was published on july   on march   adelson received the goahead from a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the

tougher about irans suspected nuclear weapons program controversy arose when he said you pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say ok let it go and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and

a jerusalem court to purchase maariv and the conservative newspaper makor rishon in  adelsons attorney announced that he does not own israel hayom it is owned by a relative of his according to a target group index tgi survey published in july  israel hayom which unlike all other israeli newspapers is distributed for free became the numberone daily newspaper on weekdays four years after its inception this survey found that israel hayom had a  weekday readership exposure yedioth ahronoth  maariv  and haaretz  the yedioth ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a  readership exposure compared to  for the israel hayom weekend edition  for maariv and  for haaretz this trend was already observed by a tgi survey in july  in  the israeli press said that adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on israeli channel  which alleged that adelson had acquired a casino license in las vegas inappropriately through political connections the channel apologized after adelson threatened a lawsuit this led to the resignations of the news chief reudor benziman the news editor ruti yuval and the news anchor guy zohar who objected to the apology after two months of deliberations the israeli second authority for television and radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate ideologyedit in a  wall street journal oped titled i didnt leave the democrats they left me adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties first he cites foreign policy pointing to a gallup poll that suggests republicans are more supportive of israel than democrats second he cites statistics that suggest republicans are more charitable than democrats to support this claim adelson adduces a report from the chronicle of philanthropy which found after studying tax data from the irs that us states that vote republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote democratic my father who kept a charity box for the poor in our house  would have frowned on this fact about modern democrats this leads him to his third reason—economic policy—for leaving the democratic party he writes democrats would reply that taxation and government services are better vehicles for helping the underprivileged and yes government certainly has its role but when you look at states where democrats have enjoyed years of oneparty dominance—california illinois new york—you find that their liberal policies simply dont deliver on their promises of social justice take for example president obamas adopted home state in october a nonpartisan study of illinoiss finances by the state budget crisis task force offered painful evidence that liberal illinois is suffering from abject economic demographic and social decline with the worst credit rating in the country and with the secondbiggest public debt per capita the prairie state has been doing back flips on a high wire without a net according to the report adelson then quotes at length political scientist walter russell mead who adelson claims summed up the sad results of these findings at the american interest illinois politicians including the present president of the united states have wrecked one of the countrys potentially most prosperous and dynamic states condemned millions of poor children to substandard education failed to maintain vital infrastructure choked business development and growth through unsustainable tax and regulatory policies — and still failed to appease the demands of the public sector unions and feeseeking wall street crony capitalists who make billions off the states distress adelson concluded the article with these words although i dont agree with every republican position—im liberal on several social issues—there is enough common cause with the party for me to know ive made the right choice its the choice that i believe my old immigrant jewish neighbors would have made they would not have let a few disagreements with republicans void the importance of siding with the political party that better supports liberal democracies like israel the party that better exemplifies the spirit of charity and the party with economic policies that would certainly be better for those americans now looking for work the democratic party just isnt what it used to be others have attributed different motives for adelsons party switch why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else he reportedly said to an associate according to the new yorker which claims adelson began making major contributions to the republican national committee following clashes with labor unions at his las vegas properties the new yorker article also quoted shelley berkley a nevada democratic party congresswoman with whom adelson has had a long and notable feud who formerly worked for him in the s as vicepresident of legal and governmental affairs who said adelson told her that old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats the boston globe claims that adelson has waged some bitter antiunion battles in las vegas berkley is further quoted in the new yorker article as saying that adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money adelson denies those explanations for his political beliefs and behavior suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics own political ideology he stated my critics nowadays like to claim its because i got wealthy or because i didnt want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature no the truth is the democratic party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing adelson questioned the obama administration in an interview with forbes what scares me is the continuation of the socialiststyle economy weve been experiencing for almost four years that scares me because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism and to more of the government controlling peoples lives what scares me is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience just let the government take care of everything us domestic politics is very important to me because i see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great … i’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give people are less willing to share there are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government i believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current administrations quest to socialize this country it won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy support for donald trumpedit adelson sat out the  republican primaries with some early indicators at the beginning of  interpreted as showing that adelson favored trump in may  explaining his reasons for officially endorsing donald trumps presidential bid adelson cited the importance of ceo experience in a presidential nominee i felt strongly that someone with that level of ceo experience would be welltrained for the job of president it turns out that is exactly what we are getting in trump he is a candidate with actual ceo experience shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public’s he is a ceo success story that exemplifies the american spirit of determination commitment to cause and business stewardship despite being the grandson of a welsh coal miner and the son of a boston cab driver i’ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost  different businesses in my more than year business career so tell me i’m not a conservative enough republican or i’m too hawkish on israel or whatever else you may think but i think i’ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership on september  adelson announced a  million donation to trumps presidential campaign as part of a  million donation to the republican electoral campaign for  this makes adelson by far the biggest donor in either party republicans or democrats in the  election cycle it also makes him by far the

tougher about irans suspected nuclear weapons program controversy arose when he said you pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say ok let it go and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever” he went on to explain that after a show of force and
