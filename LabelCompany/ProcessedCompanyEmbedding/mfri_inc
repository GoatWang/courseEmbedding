markets had an amazing bull run in  many stocks have had nice runs and even some that were not profitable in  it may be more of a stock pickers market and finding undervalued companies may be rare as many stocks enjoyed a healthy  i believe i have found an undervalued stock that remains in mfri inc mfri mfri is a multiline company engaged in the following businesses  permapipe inc global leader in preinsulated piping  leak detection systems permapipe inc is the largest manufacturer of preinsulated piping systems for district heating and cooling in north america and a global leader operating six  strategically placed manufacturing facilities worldwide our full product line also includes pipeinpipe containment systems for environmental control of hazardous fluids subsea oil  gas pipelines and

comprising dust collector inspection filter cleaning and filter replacement this segments products and services are used in utility and industrial coalfired boilers incinerators and cogeneration plants and the production of metals cement chemicals and other industrial products mfri results are impressive and unnoticed for the first  months of fiscal  ytd net sales of  million increased  from  million for the prioryear period piping systems sales increased  or  million due to the previously mentioned projects in saudi arabia filtration products decreased by  million due primarily to reduced domestic demand for fabric filter bags eps from continuing operations was  for the first  months of fiscal  as compared to a loss  for the same period in fiscal  the companys backlog from continuing operations increased  or  million from october   president and ceo bradley mautner commented the demand environment for piping systems remains active and we are now pursuing a wide variety of promising opportunities worldwide of varying size and duration with the aim of diversifying our business from a product project and geographic point of view we are also pursuing certain ventures that offer the potential over the long term to replicate the success we have had in the middle east risks for mfri would be slow replacement of their backlog however the ceo seemed optimistic in his comments additionally mfri has only  million shares outstanding and a public float of approximately  million shares lower share structure stocks can be volatile in trading and subject to extreme moves a comparable company for mfri is donaldson company inc nysedci dci is a leading worldwide provider of filtration systems and replacement parts founded in  donaldson is a technologydriven company committed to satisfying customer needs for filtration solutions through innovative research and development donaldson serves customers in the industrial and engine markets including dust collection power generation specialty filtration compressed air purification offroad equipment industrial compressors heavy trucks and light vehicles comparing mfri and dci to me shows how undervalued and unnoticed the mfri results are dci did  in eps in the most recent fiscal year and trades at  for a pe ratio of  mfri had more eps in the first  months of fiscal  than dci had all year mfri did  eps for the first  months of fy  the third quarter was exceptionally strong so assuming that the fourth quarter results would be more like the first two mfri may be on track to have eps of  for fiscal  mfri is trading at  so that is a pe ratio of  a  pe ratio on  of eps would be a stock price of  if one were to apply the dci pe ratio of  to  of eps that would be a stock price of  therefore it is
