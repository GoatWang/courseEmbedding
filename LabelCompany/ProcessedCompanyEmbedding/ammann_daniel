click here to submit a letter to the editor and we may publish it in print detroit  just over five years ago dan ammann was a littleknown thirtysomething wall street investment banker toiling away on complex corporate deals and restructurings for morgan stanley the evenkeeled new zealander harbored no ambitions about joining the auto industry let alone scaling the heights of a giant automaker but in a surprise career change and then startling ascension ammann now oversees general motors operations around the world as president hes responsible for two tasks that his boss ceo mary barra sees as key to the companys success revitalizing chevrolet and cadillac while also unifying how the companys historically fractured regional businesses make and sell vehicles both are goals that have eluded generations of gm executives most of whom had far more auto experience than ammann he was promoted from cfo to gms top operations job in early  as a career finance guy with little operational background now ammann who turned  last week has his hands on virtually every important aspect of the business he oversees the heads of gms four big regions north and south america europe and its international operations unit which includes china global chevy chief alan batey and cadillac president johan de nysschen report to him product planning and gm financial also are under his purview ammann has been showing up everywhere in his first  months as president untethered from the financial jobs that mostly sequestered him in detroit or new york hes chatted up factory workers in china peeled around racetracks in britain and popped into dealerships from dubai to dallas much of his overseas work has focused on aligning gms marketing and sales operations which long have been run autonomously for example gm is using its us dealership network setup as a template in other countries another example ammann recently promoted us buick chief duncan aldred to lead the brand globally the move gives aldred oversight of gms massive buick business in china even two years ago that couldnt have happened ammann said during a recent interview the people over there would have said look this is 9 cars the us is  weve got this thing under control ammann is trying to fix a problem that has long handicapped gm relative to volkswagen ag toyota motor corp and other big rivals says xavier mosquet a senior partner at boston consulting group who advised the us government on its bailout of gm in  gm historically has been not only regionally managed but regionally independent that mentality is why some opel executives were pulling for gm to sell opel when gm was shopping the european business in  mosquet says ammann joined gm as treasurer in april  after advising the company on its restructuring a year earlier his work caught the eye of thengm cfo christopher liddell  a fellow kiwi  and steve girsky who had joined gms board after advising the governments task force ammann is known among colleagues for an unflappable demeanor cuttothechase questions and a dry wit asked in the interview about the recent russia move he answered with a straight face weve decided its better to have a more commercial forprofit mindset he then chuckled at the reference to gms historical habit of tolerating losses hes also frank about the challenge of returning chevy and cadillac to glory the efforts of chevy marketing boss tim mahoney and batey over the past two years to unify chevys hodgepodge identity across the globe have given gms core brand a good starting point but thats all it is ammann says in cadillac gm has the beginnings of a legitimate luxury business but one that needs work rebuilding cadillac is a task that ammann made a top priority almost immediately after taking the job three years as cfo gave him a close look at the need for cadillac which now represents just  percent of gms global vehicle sales to pull more weight so that gm isnt overly reliant on pickups and suvs for profit even before his promotion ammann had casually discussed the luxury business with dealers competitors analysts  pretty much anyone who would talk to me he concluded that cadillac was stuck in a mainstream sales enterprise with its sister gm brands when luxury requires a more nuanced approach ammann separated cadillac as a standalone unit with its headquarters in manhattan in early  ammann courted de nysschen the theninfiniti boss in clandestine meetings at auto shows in geneva and other places he has given de nysschen wide latitude to execute his turnaround plan a big part of ammanns job is to serve as a conduit between the brands and gms productdevelopment organization run by mark reuss ammann often sits in on powertrain planning meetings on thursdays some fridays are spent with reuss testing engineering mules at gms proving grounds near detroit reuss says that ammann gives him a single point contact for us to execute what customers want in each of his regions if reuss chooses a continuously variable transmission for a future vehicle rather than a dualclutch ammanns team is in on the decision so its not secondguessed later it makes everything a hell of a lot easier reuss says it also makes it easier that ammann likes cars says reuss gms highestprofile car enthusiast ammann used his first bonus from morgan stanley to buy a 9 cadillac series  convertible and is a certified test driver on the nurburgring nordschleife racetrack in germany those are carguy bona fides that were lacking in the gm finance enterprise of old ammann views the most important part of his job as having the right people in the right places he likes the current mix of gm lifers and outsiders including a large contingent of vw veterans such as de nysschen international operations head stefan jacoby and opel chief karlthomas neumann he says not to expect the sort of constant executive turnover that has marked gm in the six years since bankruptcy i think we underestimate the benefit that will come from the consistency of people being in position he says and getting the chance to execute and deliver you can reach mike colias at mcoliasautonewscom tags
