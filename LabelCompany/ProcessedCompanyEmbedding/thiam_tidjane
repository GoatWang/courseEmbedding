qa with tidjane thiam ‘i will never declare victory’ qa with tidjane thiam‘i will never declare victory’ by francine lacqua  august   photographs by felicity mccabe from bankers face a daunting environment today particularly chief executives of european institutions—as tidjane thiam of credit suisse has learned firsthand since thiam took the reins as ceo in july  the yearold bank has lost more than half its market value critics have scrutinized him from the start for a lack of banking experience and the swiss media has repeatedly speculated about a possible replacement born in the ivory coast thiam studied engineering at école nationale supérieure des mines de paris one of france’s most prestigious universities before working as a consultant at mckinsey then rising in his native country’s government to become a cabinet member and eventually taking over as ceo of insurer prudential months after thiam’s start at credit suisse—a bank steeped in history but mired in controversy—thiam announced his strategy expand wealth management and reduce dependence on trading he raised capital and pushed ahead with cost cuts an abysmal first quarter was followed by an unexpected secondquarter profit supporters say thiam’s turnaround is already working operating expenses recently fell to the lowest level in more than two years and the lender’s core capital ratio increased over two interviews in july thiam explained why sports is a blueprint for running a bank divulged what type of criticism wounds him most and discussed the bank’s strategy progress and many challenges “luck is not a strategy” he says francine lacqua you’ve been in charge at credit suisse for a little more than a year now it’s been rocky at times what have you learned tidjane thiam it’s been a very interesting busy year we’ve defined a new strategy for credit suisse which is really leveraging the brand of the bank it’s very old and strong one of the reference brands in the world of banking there was a lot of heavy lifting at the beginning because we had to strengthen our capital balance sheet and change the nature of our market activities—to consume less capital and to also have less volatile earnings when you describe all of that it’s sensible the real challenge has been to do that in very challenging markets the last  months have not been very bankfriendly fl your secondquarter results were better than expected are you starting to win tt oh god i will never declare victory i played a lot of sports and you never declare victory until the final whistle but it’s a good start i’m pleased for our people who’ve worked really hard what is nice in life is to succeed together it’s why i’ve always liked team sports fl were those results a signal to the market that you don’t need to raise capital tt i’m a cautious man so i will never say words like “we don’t need to raise capital” i will caveat that with in most foreseeable scenarios we do not need to raise capital being in control of our own destiny i think that’s ultimately what management is about now we can focus on what the business is supposed to do which is serve the clients you always have to go back to the clients and start from there this interview appears in the new issue of bloomberg markets subscribe now cover artwork alexandra compaintissier fl how is that guiding you tt a business has to have a purpose and the purpose of what we do is to create value for our clients it’s the raison d’être we are nothing without our clients if you listen to your clients then the rest is relatively easy it becomes we understand what they want we’re going to support them fl are you going to update the strategy at all tt when you design a strategy you have to make it flexible as the world moves from brexit to other things there will always be unexpected events that we need to take into account but overall in its key features the strategy should last i believe in the strategy we’ve defined i’ll tell it to you in one sentence to be a leading private bank wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities fl you’ve been under scrutiny because of the share price how much of that scrutiny is fair tt the share price frankly has dropped a lot there are many reasons why overall i’m very pleased with the progress made because you have to think about what we’ve been trying to achieve which has been to fundamentally derisk the business if you go back to the third quarter of  we had the var value at risk at about  million the average european bank had  million so we were running about twice the trading risk of the average european bank and our cet ratio tier  capital was about  percent the average european bank had about  percent the way the business was organized meant that we were taking quite a bit of risk with not a lot of capital the journey we’ve been on is to change those terms fl how’s morale can you put it on a scale of  to  tt i cannot quantify it but it’s improving—it’s even palpable people inside the company comment that it’s an improving trend directs attention to a year chart of credit suisse’s share price and then pinpoints his july  arrival this is me the narrative in the media is “an evil person clearly came and destroyed this great bank look” sorry that didn’t happen maybe we’ve gone down by  percent since i started but it was divided by  first—and that’s over  years i’m here and if i’m going to be crucified for that so be it but the facts are the facts and the facts are stubborn fl are you unlucky tt no it’s not a question of being unlucky it’s just the way it is i can do many things but i have not created problems of that scale in  or  months we are dealing with a situation that developed over a period of  years at least now the problems are visible and we have a strategy to tackle them they were there before and not visible so we have given the markets transparency sometimes the truth is not very pleasant but that’s what it is at least now there’s a chance that it’s going to be addressed fl how much time do you have to correct the share price tt look ultimately the share price is the single most important thing am i happy with where the share price is no i feel sorry for our shareholders that we are at this price level—and remember i am a shareholder too we are working hard to correct this situation i firmly believe that it will be corrected because the share price absolutely does not reflect the value of the company we have a lot of work to do to convince the market that we have a new model i believe it’s the right model but we need to build a track record we’re also not the only bank in this position fl how long does it take to build a track record tt i cannot make a forecast all i know is that in my previous experience as ceo it took quite a few quarters—which is fair and you have to demonstrate results quarter after quarter fl what do your biggest shareholders say tt they really want us to drive the strategy forward to execute and not get distracted it’s very simple control the elements control the risk one shareholder told me “thank you you are reducing risk for many years i’ve been told we were reducing risk now i believe it’s being reduced i can see it” the fact that we have derisked allows us to focus on serving our clients rather than worrying about balance sheets and winning in the marketplace “the process is often as important as the outcome” fl what have your critics gotten wrong about you and what have they gotten right tt the kinds of changes i’ve described that we are implementing cannot happen without disruption that disruption is painful i don’t minimize it i recognize it it’s very difficult for a lot of people and of course it generates a lot of noise and discomfort but we believe we can develop this together fl this economic environment presents more than a few challenges what’s the path forward tt if you look at the sector today ultimately the real challenge is a lack of belief in our ability to grow sustainably and profitably at the end of the day the evaluation of a company is about growth the only answer is to cut costs that becomes the only way to grow earnings if there’s never any topline growth that’s necessary in certain parts of any business but ultimately you also need to be able to grow fl when will you feel as if you’ve cut enough costs tt when we don’t have to cut them anymore my real philosophy about cost is productivity gain i am for all my faults and sins an engineer i come from a culture of automation technology i believe in productivity improvements an organization should improve productivity by  or  percent every year and i always prefer to talk about productivity more than cost it’s a much better word because that’s what’s relevant we’re promoting a culture of continuous improvement and the restructuring and reengineering is very deep it’s about changing the structure of processes and redesigning them in a more efficient way our global markets division has done a pilot of that and their solution was a fronttoback but also backtofront reengineering in eight weeks they’re really excited about the opportunities where we can serve our clients better cheaper and faster but for that you need to break the silos you need to get people around the table and say “how can we work better” fl so how do you build a team tt it’s a very important thing maybe that’s all we do in business—because at the end of the day that’s the only way we can impact reality and change things you have to be inclusive i hear all the criticism but if you look at the five divisions we have they’re each run by someone from within i didn’t bring one person from the outside to run the businesses i could have but i didn’t so it was a form of a compliment to the organization i really have nothing but respect for the people inside and then it’s really getting the team to work together there’s no substitute for spending time together it’s the only way humans get to know each other the central point of which is that we can reliably predict what we’re going to do and with that you can control the outcomes often the problems come from the uncertainty and not knowing how we’re going to react also having gone through a fire together generates trust that’s human nature and trust is the glue with which you move forward fl do you have the support of your investment bankers tt the proof of the pudding is in the eating i wrote a memo to congratulate everyone for brexit because it took a lot of coordination to manage that well we had worked for weeks two weeks before i got uncomfortable i could see the bookies were saying there was a  percent chance of brexit which was too high it was a bit like a russian roulette probability we had to set a maximum loss and then we took that number down we went into the referendum in a safe place and our execution was excellent because it was across units across markets across divisions it was a robust reallife stress test and i’m thrilled how well the organization performed everybody pulled together fl why do shareholders have so many questions about credit suisse tt i’m not sure that they have more fundamental questions i think it’s really as i described we’re doing the heavy lifting derisking restructuring in markets that are completely unsupportive so if you think about what we did between the end of the year and the end of the first quarter we cut the var by onethird we reduced the risk by onethird that’s a massive derisking—one of the most massive ever conducted in the industry and we conducted it very quickly and at a reasonable cost fl less than four months into the job you unveiled a whole new strategy for credit suisse should you have waited tt no because we really needed the capital i won’t elaborate on what would have happened if we had hit the fourth quarter without the capital fl but it would have been ugly tt i will leave the choice of words to you it would have been at least uncomfortable extremely uncomfortable my view on risk is that you never know when things are going to go wrong so you always need to be in a position where you can withstand any shock luck is not a strategy fl was there a communication problem when you unveiled the strategy shareholders said they didn’t get enough details which led some to question it tt the key thing is to learn some lessons from every situation as we all know one cannot change the past what happened happened and it’s really “what do we do going forward” fl it’s been said you look at risk as a consultant does which you once were tt i’ve been working for  years i was a consultant for  of them i left mckinsey in  that’s a long time ago kids who were born then are in college now like my son so no my focus on risk is because financial services is all about risk it has little to do with my consulting background it’s about taking risks and making sure you’re appropriately rewarded for them i think the fear when you focus on risk is that you’re not a risk taker but i don’t think there’s a lot of evidence of that in my life and my career “the single most important thing in life is not to die first you stay alive then you can think about the future and evaluate risk” fl how has your view of risk changed tt risk is at the heart of capitalism without risk there isn’t capitalism and i’m a great believer in the capitalist system but the risk appetite of investors has changed postcrisis regulations have changed the interest rate environment has changed and the macroeconomic environment has changed tolerance for a certain level of volatility of earnings in regulated companies has gone down people have no appetite so companies have to take that into account and when i say we have to profoundly rethink how we run a bank that’s part of the debate my absolute no  priority was to shore up the capital from there it’s a chance to survive the single most important thing in life is not to die first you stay alive then you can think about the future and evaluate risk we didn’t have that luxury not with the lowest cet in the industry and carrying twice the risk fl if you could change one thing about credit suisse straightaway what would you do tt you mean other than the share price laughs fl is that what you would change tt no see the thing with change is that the process is often as important as the outcome you grow and you develop and you learn by achieving difficult things that has enormous value a magic change would almost not be worth having because you wouldn’t learn anything and you might end up repeating the same mistake i’m tempted to say nothing because it’s good to learn things there’s a lot that an organization and its people can learn from that process fl when you took charge of credit suisse you were seen as an outsider are you still an outsider looking in or are you an insider tt in my head i’m an insider it was a big decision for me to take this job it’s an unusually important job i’m really excited about it i think the power of this franchise will show over time the central point in all this is that we’ve really given a lot of thought to what a bank should look like in the new postcrisis world we’ve come up with a model that addresses those questions and every indication we have in terms of numbers shows it’s working we’re dealing with a lot of issues that aren’t resolved but we’re convinced that these are the right issues to deal with photographer felicity mccabe fl so if you had to build a bank from scratch what would it look like tt clientfocused client client client to me we should only engage in activities that mean something for a client somewhere that’s a question i ask “what is this going to do and for whom” that has to drive the whole business so it’s a bank that’s really clientfocused and is trying to understand its clients and accompany them in what they do it’s also having really really good people i pay credit here to credit suisse and the culture of this bank we have a long tradition of great people who are really creative and willing to change things—which we’re doing now finally and maybe this is a more personal thing i like doing meaningful things in the societal sense of the word i see us as a force for good in the world economy fl you’ve made ultrahighnetworth individuals a big part of your strategy how do you win their business tt it’s a people business a relationship business which is something i like it gives a huge premium to the human aspect of it there’s an alignment and a closeness between our people and the clients that’s great to see there’s a lot of wealth accumulating in emerging markets where we’ve built a strong presence all that wealth all that gdp is driven by entrepreneurs we see opportunities everywhere we have  billion of assets in asia there’s plenty of room for growth there we see opportunities in europe in the us there’s about  billionaires in the us our investment bank serves about  of them how do you develop those relationships by doing things for them fl what sort of things tt either from a business perspective—buy a company bring ideas—or what i talk about in asia the monetization of illiquid wealth this is really a central concept in our emergingmarkets strategy for these billionaires much of their wealth is in physical assets what you do as a banker is monetize those assets moving them out of that position takes a lot of investment banking skill we can only be successful in the long term if we are best in class at investment banking these clients don’t want to deal with the second best or third best “we need to create a better track record unless you have credibility your share price will be under pressure” fl what do you wish someone would have told you when you were considering this job tt i think i went into it with my eyes open i knew it would be very difficult a lot of issues weren’t hidden no it was—and is—a big executional challenge which is something where we as a bank haven’t excelled delivering what we’ve said on the cost the capital the development of the businesses and that’s why i focus so much on our execution fl where is there the most room for improvement tt we need to create a better track record if you look at the last  quarters we’ve only met or beaten expectations six times which means we’ve missed them  percent of the time our peers have a positive statistic they’ve missed  percent of the time and hit the other  unless you have credibility your share price will be under pressure fl when do you think you’ll have less scrutiny tt i don’t know one hundred percent of my energy is focused on driving the company it’s hard enough doing what’s right for the company it’s not the first time i’ve submitted to scrutiny so i just have to live with it look how do i feel about my life i get up in the morning and i try to do my best and i do that every day one day at a time—from when i get up to when i go to bed and that’s what i focus on because that’s what i control the level of scrutiny i cannot control fl how often do you feel you’re misrepresented tt it’s my fault i must misspeak too much fl there aren’t many black ceos in europe do you see yourself as a champion of diversity tt oh that’s a simple issue i happen to be black i say i’m black and i’m righthanded when i get up in the morning i think about neither i wasn’t given a choice i could have been lefthanded but i’m righthanded i don’t spend a lot of time wondering what life would have been like if i’d been lefthanded fl let’s talk about your cultural influences you have many do you feel european swiss do you feel like a londoner do you feel ivorian tt i’m all of those things fortunately or unfortunately first of all i speak in french which is my mother tongue—and not by choice it’s the fruit of history because france colonized my country a long time ago i’m a great believer that language shapes and structures your way of thinking i’m european if only by language my home was steeped in french culture french literature i read a lot then i discovered progressively the englishspeaking world—england the us—i loved that too i’ve also got very strong african roots in my family when we went home we always took off our western clothes and wore african clothes once a week we sat down and ate from the common bowl on the floor my mother generally wore african clothes at a time in the s when it wasn’t really popular to do so and so i’m all of that i also happen to have spent a good part of my childhood in morocco so i have a good understanding of the arab world fl tell me something else that people don’t know about you or that they get wrong tt that would be a very long list fl there must be something that bugs you tt i’m revealing a vulnerability here but any accusation of arrogance that really wounds me very deeply because that’s just—i’m completely happy to admit to many faults i can be impatient for instance but arrogance i have such respect for other human beings it’s such a central part of who i am that’s something that i find extremely unfair fl and you’ve always been like that tt yes absolutely i come from a very humanistic culture one that’s focused on the person i was raised deeply like that by my parents both my parents they passionately believed in justice the first day my father was in the ivory coast in  he got arrested for not stepping off the curb when he met a white person because that’s the way it was and so my parents just really believed in fairness and equality they never asked for any advantages also there was a big emphasis on education a strong belief in some kind of meritocracy those values were very important fl how was your relationship with your siblings tt i’m the seventh of seven with four brothers there was a lot of competition but healthy competition they really wanted me to achieve the most i could fl how rough were they tt i had a double fracture in my leg from one of my brothers tackling me so it was real but there was a lot of love too “i’m black and i’m righthanded when i get up in the morning i think about neither” fl you have two sons what would you like to instill in them tt hmm what do i tell them the most i think i’ve always felt that your real capital in life is your selfesteem i have always thought of parenthood as a huge responsibility because you have to take a human being to adulthood with the maximum amount of selfesteem i tell them not to compromise that selfesteem dignity it’s all you have if that’s taken away it will kill you as surely as a bullet all the rest—possessions et cetera—can be taken away fl is that something you learned from your parents tt yes although my mother would put it differently but it’s very important in the end that’s the core of your personality and your ability to do things and if it’s damaged it leads to a lot of dysfunctional behaviors fl how did your mother put it tt i’ll keep that for myself i don’t have her approval to quote her and she’s been gone a long time fl who else have you learned from tt i learn from everybody really i always recruit people to work for me who are much better than i am at many things and i watch them and try to learn from them because i really think everybody is good at something—at least one thing if not more and if you look every once in a while you think “wow that person is really interesting” fl whom do you admire tt i’m not going to tell you then everyone else will be annoyed no there are many people i admire fl you heard from roger federer when you became ceo of credit suisse tt i was very touched he sent a video message saying “welcome to switzerland we hope you have a good time here” i have immense admiration for athletes in some ways they exemplify the best features of the human spirit the level of excellence they achieve the apparent ease the grace roger is a model of a human being he always behaves with dignity he’s a great champion he’s always gracious to his opponents whether he wins or loses and he’s a credit suisse client laughs fl who else photographer felicity mccabe tt well i have a fascinating life on my last trip to china i counted  billionaires—in dollars—individually in an hour well three hours because it was a dinner and each of them is exceptional i went to china for the first time in  so often i ask “what were you doing in ” and the answer generally is “all i owned was a bicycle” and then you go through how they got to where they are they’re exceptional people i love spending time with them and i learn a lot fl how does your business in asia differ from elsewhere tt on the state of wealth in asia  percent is in the hands of the first generation—so the people who actually made the money in europe most of the money—more than half—is in the hands of the fourth or fifth generation the kind of wealth management you do in those two universes is very different fl do you see consolidation among european banks tt i think that would be very difficult in this new environment one of the biggest headlines in the media remains “too big to fail” if that’s the motto how do you make institutions bigger by definition if you put two institutions together you create a bigger institution fl if you were to buy one bank tt as i’ve said the whole mood is not supportive of that we have plenty of organic growth available plenty we don’t need to do a transaction fl credit suisse itself is the product of consolidation does the first boston legacy hinder or help tt look you can’t separate things we’re the product of several traditions and each is a core part of our identity this is like asking someone if their parents hinder or help you’ve got what you’ve got you have a mother you have a father that’s our genetic heritage and there are many great things about first boston it’s precious to have in our dna because it was always able to punch above its weight i like the kind of grit and gogetter attitude there fl which do you prefer winning or competing tt oh that’s a philosophical question i think both are very enjoyable i enjoy competition but fair competition with rules transparent competition where everybody has a chance winning is nice if it’s done the right way without breaking the rules and if you can win in many championships there’s a fair play title if you can both get the fair play prize and win then that’s great fl and in business tt it depends on how you define winning to me winning is serving your clients having their loyalty because ultimately that’s what business is that’s what keeps you going and then lasting prudential where i was ceo previously was created in  credit suisse was created in  so i’ve had the privilege of serving relatively old companies and that’s always present in my mind i have to pass the baton i have to keep it going because god it’s been going a long time fl what’s a better business insurance or banking tt laughs they are both vital for the world economy and play a very important social role fl you more than doubled the share value at prudential do you want to be the ceo who saved prudential or the one who saves credit suisse tt i just aspire to leave the company in a better state than i found it and that can continue fl would you ever go back to politics tt no that’s the easiest question you’ve asked me fl why not tt there’s a time for everything i don’t regret doing it i learned an enormous amount about how the government operates the complexities and the challenges which gives me a better understanding visàvis public sector employees they have a difficult job having tried to drive an economy that’s a humbling experience driving a company is hard enough the sevenyear short mark hart of corriente advisors has been betting that china’s currency will collapse he’s not about to give up now fl you love your job tt laughs i love the people because they are worth it this is why accusations hurt when people say i am distant if you come to a town hall with me or the trading floor it’s the people who are interesting and there is nothing more exciting than when you can get people to do something they think they’re not able to do that’s very very gratifying fl if you were to lose your job tomorrow what would be your biggest regret tt that’s a fantastic question not being part of the collective journey anymore that it’s going to go on without me when i think i can make a positive contribution fl how hungry are you for this job compared with when you started tt hungrier i see more opportunities now i saw some from the outside but now i can really see the scale and range of the opportunities and they are vast of course you also understand the problems and the challenges but

little more than a year now it’s been rocky at times what have you learned tidjane thiam it’s been a very interesting busy year we’ve defined a new strategy for credit suisse which is really leveraging the brand of the bank it’s very old and strong one of the reference brands in the world of banking there was a lot of heavy lifting at the beginning because we had to strengthen our capital balance sheet and change the nature of our market activities—to consume less capital and to also have less volatile earnings when you describe all of that it’s sensible the real challenge has been to do that in very challenging markets the last  months have not been very bankfriendly fl your secondquarter results were better than expected are you starting to win tt oh god i will never declare

raise capital” i will caveat that with in most foreseeable scenarios we do not need to raise capital being in control of our own destiny i think that’s ultimately what management is about now we can

the strategy at all tt when you design a strategy you have to make it flexible as the world moves from brexit to other things there will always be unexpected events that we need to take into account but overall in its key features the strategy should last i believe in the strategy we’ve defined i’ll tell it to you in one sentence to be a leading private bank wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities fl you’ve been under scrutiny because of the share price how much of that scrutiny is fair tt the share price frankly has dropped a lot there are many reasons why overall i’m very pleased with the progress made because you have to think about what we’ve been trying to achieve which has been to fundamentally derisk the business if you go back to the third quarter of  we had the var value at risk at about  million the average european bank had  million so we were running about twice the trading risk of the average european bank and our cet ratio tier  capital was about  percent the average european bank had about  percent the way the business was organized meant that we were taking quite a bit of risk with not a lot of capital the journey we’ve been on is to change those terms fl how’s morale can you put it on a scale of  to  tt i cannot quantify it but it’s improving—it’s even palpable people inside the company comment that it’s an improving trend directs attention to a year chart of credit suisse’s share price and then pinpoints his july  arrival this is me the narrative in the media is “an evil person clearly came and destroyed this great bank look” sorry that didn’t happen maybe we’ve gone down by  percent since i started but it was divided by  first—and that’s over  years i’m here and if i’m going to be crucified for that so be it but the facts are the facts and the facts are stubborn fl are you unlucky tt no it’s not a question of being unlucky it’s just the way it is i can do many things but i have not created problems of that scale in  or  months we are dealing with a situation that developed over a period of  years at least now the problems are visible and we have a strategy to tackle them they were there before and not visible so we have given the markets transparency sometimes the truth is not very pleasant but that’s what it is at least now there’s a chance that it’s going to be addressed fl how much time do you have to correct the share price tt look ultimately the share price is the single most important thing am i happy with where the share price is no i feel sorry for our shareholders that we are at this price level—and remember i am a shareholder too we are working hard to correct this situation i firmly believe that it will be corrected because the share price absolutely does not reflect the value of the company we have a lot of work to do to convince the market that we have a new model i believe it’s the right model but we need to build a track record we’re also not the only bank in this position fl how long does it take to build a track record tt i cannot make a forecast all i know is that in my previous experience as ceo it took quite a few quarters—which is fair and you have to demonstrate results quarter after quarter fl what do your biggest shareholders say tt they really want us to drive the strategy forward to execute and not get distracted it’s very simple control the elements control the risk one shareholder told me “thank you you are reducing risk for many years i’ve been told we were reducing risk now i believe it’s being reduced i can see it” the fact that we have derisked allows us to focus on serving our clients rather than worrying about balance sheets and winning in the marketplace “the process is often as important as the outcome” fl what have your critics gotten wrong about you and what have they gotten right tt the kinds of changes i’ve described that we are implementing cannot happen without disruption that disruption is painful i don’t minimize it i recognize it it’s very difficult for a lot of people and of course it generates a lot of noise and discomfort but we believe we can develop this together fl this economic environment presents more than a few challenges what’s the path forward tt if you look at the sector today ultimately the real challenge is a lack of belief in our ability to grow sustainably and profitably at the end of the day the evaluation of a company is about growth the only answer is to cut costs that becomes the only way to grow earnings if there’s never any topline growth that’s necessary in certain parts of any business but ultimately you also need to be able to grow fl when will you feel as if you’ve cut enough costs tt when we don’t have to cut them anymore my real philosophy about cost is productivity gain i am for all my faults and sins an engineer i come from a culture of automation technology i believe in productivity improvements an organization should improve productivity by  or  percent every year and i always prefer to talk about productivity more than cost it’s a much better word because that’s what’s relevant we’re promoting a culture of continuous improvement and the restructuring and reengineering is very deep it’s about changing the structure of processes and redesigning them in a more efficient way our global markets division has done a pilot of that and their solution was a fronttoback but also backtofront reengineering in eight weeks they’re really excited about the opportunities where we can serve our clients better cheaper and faster but for that you need to break the silos you need to get people around the table and say “how can we work better” fl so how do you build a team tt it’s a very important thing maybe that’s all we do in business—because at the end of the day that’s the only way we can impact reality and change things you have to be inclusive i hear all the criticism but if you look at the five divisions we have they’re each run by someone from within i didn’t bring one person from the outside to run the businesses i could have but i didn’t so it was a form of a compliment to the organization i really have nothing but respect for the people inside and then it’s really getting the team to work together there’s no substitute for spending time together it’s the only way humans get to know each other the central point of which is that we can reliably predict what we’re going to do and with that you can control the outcomes often the problems come from the uncertainty and not knowing how we’re going to react also having gone through a fire together generates trust that’s human nature and trust is the glue with which you move forward fl do you have the support of your investment bankers tt the proof of the pudding is in the eating i wrote a memo to congratulate everyone for brexit because it took a lot of coordination to manage that well we had worked for weeks two weeks before i got uncomfortable i could see the bookies were saying there was a  percent chance of brexit which was too high it was a bit like a russian roulette probability we had to set a maximum loss and then we took that number down we went into the referendum in a safe place and our execution was excellent because it was across units across markets across divisions it was a robust reallife stress test and i’m thrilled how well the organization performed everybody pulled together fl why do shareholders have so many questions about credit suisse tt i’m not sure that they have more fundamental questions i think it’s really as i described we’re doing the heavy lifting derisking restructuring in markets that are completely unsupportive so if you think about what we did between the end of the year and the end of the first quarter we cut the var by onethird we reduced the risk by onethird that’s a massive derisking—one of the most massive ever conducted in the industry and we conducted it very quickly and at a reasonable cost fl less than four months into the job you unveiled a whole new strategy for credit suisse should you have waited tt no because we really needed the capital i won’t elaborate on what would have happened if we had hit the fourth quarter without the capital fl but it would have been ugly tt i will leave the choice of words to you it would have been at least uncomfortable extremely uncomfortable my view on risk is that you never know when things are going to go wrong so you always need to be in a position where you can withstand any shock luck is not a strategy fl was there a communication problem when you unveiled the strategy shareholders said they didn’t get enough details which led some to question it tt the key thing is to learn some lessons from every situation as we all know one cannot change the past what happened happened and it’s really “what do we do going forward” fl it’s been said you look at risk as a consultant does which you once were tt i’ve been working for  years i was a consultant for  of them i left mckinsey in  that’s a long time ago kids who were born then are in college now like my son so no my focus on risk is because financial services is all about risk it has little to do with my consulting background it’s about taking risks and making sure you’re appropriately rewarded for them i think the fear when you focus on risk is that you’re not a risk taker but i don’t think there’s a lot of evidence of that in my life and my career “the single most important thing in life is not to die first you stay alive then you can think about the future and evaluate risk” fl how has your view of risk changed tt risk is at the heart of capitalism without risk there isn’t capitalism and i’m a great believer in the capitalist system but the risk appetite of investors has changed postcrisis regulations have changed the interest rate environment has changed and the macroeconomic environment has changed tolerance for a certain level of volatility of earnings in regulated companies has gone down people have no appetite so companies have to take that into account and when i say we have to profoundly rethink how we run a bank that’s part of the debate my absolute no  priority was to shore up the capital from there it’s a chance to survive the single most important thing in life is not to die first you stay alive then you can think about the future and evaluate risk we didn’t have that luxury not with the lowest cet in the industry and carrying twice the risk fl if you could change one thing about credit suisse straightaway what would you do tt you mean other than the share price laughs fl is that what you would change tt no see the thing with change is that the process is often as important as the outcome you grow and you develop and you learn by achieving difficult things that has enormous value a magic change would almost not be worth having because you wouldn’t learn anything and you might end up repeating the same mistake i’m tempted to say nothing because it’s good to learn things there’s a lot that an organization and its people can learn from that process fl when you took charge of credit suisse you were seen as an outsider are you still an outsider looking in or are you an insider tt in my head i’m an insider it was a big decision for me to take this job it’s an unusually important job i’m really excited about it i think the power of this franchise will show over time the central point in all this is that we’ve really given a lot of thought to what a bank should look like in the new postcrisis world we’ve come up with a model that addresses those questions and every indication we have in terms of numbers shows it’s working we’re dealing with a lot of issues that aren’t resolved but we’re convinced that these are the right issues to deal with photographer felicity mccabe fl so if you had to build a bank from scratch what would it look like tt clientfocused client client client to me we should only engage in activities that mean something for a client somewhere that’s a question i ask “what is this going to do and for whom” that has to drive the whole business so it’s a bank that’s really clientfocused and is trying to understand its clients and accompany them in what they do it’s also having really really good people i pay credit here to credit suisse and the culture of this bank we have a long tradition of great people who are really creative and willing to change things—which we’re doing now finally and maybe this is a more personal thing i like doing meaningful things in the societal sense of the word i see us as a force for good in the world economy fl you’ve made ultrahighnetworth individuals a big part of your strategy how do you win their business tt it’s a people business a relationship business which is something i like it gives a huge premium to the human aspect of it there’s an alignment and a closeness between our people and the clients that’s great to see there’s a lot of wealth accumulating in emerging markets where we’ve built a strong presence all that wealth all that gdp is driven by entrepreneurs we see opportunities everywhere we have  billion of assets in asia there’s plenty of room for growth there we see opportunities in europe in the us there’s about  billionaires in the us our investment bank serves about  of them how do you develop those relationships by doing things for them fl what sort of things tt either from a business perspective—buy a company bring ideas—or what i talk about in asia the monetization of illiquid wealth this is really a central concept in our emergingmarkets strategy for these billionaires much of their wealth is in physical assets what you do as a banker is monetize those assets moving them out of that position takes a lot of investment banking skill we can only be successful in the long term if we are best in class at investment banking these clients don’t want to deal with the second best or third best “we need to create a better track record unless you have credibility your share price will be under pressure” fl what do you wish someone would have told you when you were considering this job tt i think i went into it with my eyes open i knew it would be very difficult a lot of issues weren’t hidden no it was—and is—a big executional challenge which is something where we as a bank haven’t excelled delivering what we’ve said on the cost the capital the development of the businesses and that’s why i focus so much on our execution fl where is there the most room for improvement tt we need to create a better track record if you look at the last  quarters we’ve only met or beaten expectations six times which means we’ve missed them  percent of the time our peers have a positive statistic they’ve missed  percent of the time and hit the other  unless you have credibility your share price will be under pressure fl when do you think you’ll have less scrutiny tt i don’t know one hundred percent of my energy is focused on driving the company it’s hard enough doing what’s right for the company it’s not the first time i’ve submitted to scrutiny so i just have to live with it look how do i feel about my life i get up in the morning and i try to do my best and i do that every day one day at a time—from when i get up to when i go to bed and that’s what i focus on because that’s what i control the level of scrutiny i cannot control fl how often do you feel you’re misrepresented tt it’s my fault i must misspeak too much fl there aren’t many black ceos in europe do you see yourself as a champion of diversity tt oh that’s a simple issue i happen to be black i say i’m black and i’m righthanded when i get up in the morning i think about neither i wasn’t given a choice i could have been lefthanded but i’m righthanded i don’t spend a lot of time wondering what life would have been like if i’d been lefthanded fl let’s talk about your cultural influences you have many do you feel european swiss do you feel like a londoner do you feel ivorian tt i’m all of those things fortunately or unfortunately first of all i speak in french which is my mother tongue—and not by choice it’s the fruit of history because france colonized my country a long time ago i’m a great believer that language shapes and structures your way of thinking i’m european if only by language my home was steeped in french culture french literature i read a lot then i discovered progressively the englishspeaking world—england the us—i loved that too i’ve also got very strong african roots in my family when we went home we always took off our western clothes and wore african clothes once a week we sat down and ate from the common bowl on the floor my mother generally wore african clothes at a time in the s when it wasn’t really popular to do so and so i’m all of that i also happen to have spent a good part of my childhood in morocco so i have a good understanding of the arab world fl tell me something else that people don’t know about you or that they get wrong tt that would be a very long list fl there must be something that bugs you tt i’m revealing a vulnerability here but any accusation of arrogance that really wounds me very deeply because that’s just—i’m completely happy to admit to many faults i can be impatient for instance but arrogance i have such respect for other human beings it’s such a central part of who i am that’s something that i find extremely unfair fl and you’ve always been like that tt yes absolutely i come from a very humanistic culture one that’s focused on the person i was raised deeply like that by my parents both my parents they passionately believed in justice the first day my father was in the ivory coast in  he got arrested for not stepping off the curb when he met a white person because that’s the way it was and so my parents just really believed in fairness and equality they never asked for any advantages also there was a big emphasis on education a strong belief in some kind of meritocracy those values were very important fl how was your relationship with your siblings tt i’m the seventh of seven with four brothers there was a lot of competition but healthy competition they really wanted me to achieve the most i could fl how rough were they tt i had a double fracture in my leg from one of my brothers tackling me so it was real but there was a lot of love too “i’m black and i’m righthanded when i get up in the morning i think about neither” fl you have two sons what would you like to instill in them tt hmm what do i tell them the most i think i’ve always felt that your real capital in life is your selfesteem i have always thought of parenthood as a huge responsibility because you have to take a human being to adulthood with the maximum amount of selfesteem i tell them not to compromise that selfesteem dignity it’s all you have if that’s taken away it will kill you as surely as a bullet all the rest—possessions et cetera—can be taken away fl is that something you learned from your parents tt yes although my mother would put it differently but it’s very important in the end that’s the core of your personality and your ability to do things and if it’s damaged it leads to a lot of dysfunctional behaviors fl how did your mother put it tt i’ll keep that for myself i don’t have her approval to quote her and she’s been gone a long time fl who else have you learned from tt i learn from everybody really i always recruit people to work for me who are much better than i am at many things and i watch them and try to learn from them because i really think everybody is good at something—at least one thing if not more and if you look every once in a while you think “wow that person is really interesting” fl whom do you admire tt i’m not going to tell you then everyone else will be annoyed no there are many people i admire fl you heard from roger federer when you became ceo of credit suisse tt i was very touched he sent a video message saying “welcome to switzerland we hope you have a good time here” i have immense admiration for athletes in some ways they exemplify the best features of the human spirit the level of excellence they achieve the apparent ease the grace roger is a model of a human being he always behaves with dignity he’s a great champion he’s always gracious to his opponents whether he wins or loses and he’s a credit suisse client laughs fl who else photographer felicity mccabe tt well i have a fascinating life on my last trip to china i counted  billionaires—in dollars—individually in an hour well three hours because it was a dinner and each of them is exceptional i went to china for the first time in  so often i ask “what were you doing in ” and the answer generally is “all i owned was a bicycle” and then you go through how they got to where they are they’re exceptional people i love spending time with them and i learn a lot fl how does your business in asia differ from elsewhere tt on the state of wealth in asia  percent is in the hands of the first generation—so the people who actually made the money in europe most of the money—more than half—is in the hands of the fourth or fifth generation the kind of wealth management you do in those two universes is very different fl do you see consolidation among european banks tt i think that would be very difficult in this new environment one of the biggest headlines in the media remains “too big to fail” if that’s the motto how do you make institutions bigger by definition if you put two institutions together you create a bigger institution fl if you were to buy one bank tt as i’ve said the whole mood is not supportive of that we have plenty of organic growth available plenty we don’t need to do a transaction fl credit suisse itself is the product of consolidation does the first boston legacy hinder or help tt look you can’t separate things we’re the product of several traditions and each is a core part of our identity this is like asking someone if their parents hinder or help you’ve got what you’ve got you have a mother you have a father that’s our genetic heritage and there are many great things about first boston it’s precious to have in our dna because it was always able to punch above its weight i like the kind of grit and gogetter attitude there fl which do you prefer winning or competing tt oh that’s a philosophical question i think both are very enjoyable i enjoy competition but fair competition with rules transparent competition where everybody has a chance winning is nice if it’s done the right way without breaking the rules and if you can win in many championships there’s a fair play title if you can both get the fair play prize and win then that’s great fl and in business tt it depends on how you define winning to me winning is serving your clients having their loyalty because ultimately that’s what business is that’s what keeps you going and then lasting prudential where i was ceo previously was created in  credit suisse was created in  so i’ve had the privilege of serving relatively old companies and that’s always present in my mind i have to pass the baton i have to keep it going because god it’s been going a long time fl what’s a better business insurance or banking tt laughs they are both vital for the world economy and play a very important social role fl you more than doubled the share value at prudential do you want to be the ceo who saved prudential or the one who saves credit suisse tt i just aspire to leave the company in a better state than i found it and that can continue fl would you ever go back to politics tt no that’s the easiest question you’ve asked me fl why not tt there’s a time for everything i don’t regret doing it i learned an enormous amount about how the government operates the complexities and the challenges which gives me a better understanding visàvis public sector employees they have a difficult job having tried to drive an economy that’s a humbling experience driving a company is hard enough the sevenyear short mark hart of corriente advisors has been betting that china’s currency will collapse he’s not about to give up now fl you love your job tt laughs i love the people because they are worth it this is why accusations hurt when people say i am distant if you come to a town hall with me or the trading floor it’s the people who are interesting and there is nothing more exciting than when you can get people to do something they think they’re not able to do that’s very very gratifying fl if you were to lose your job tomorrow what would be your biggest regret tt that’s a fantastic question not being part of the collective journey anymore that it’s going to go on without me when i think i can make a positive contribution fl how hungry are you for this job compared with when you started tt hungrier i see more opportunities now i saw some from the outside but now i can really see the scale and range of the opportunities and they are vast of course you also understand the problems and the challenges but luckily you get both lacqua is an anchor

modified on thursday  may   edt credit suisse’s new chief executive tidjane thiam signalled a strategy shakeup on thursday designed to focus on banking for the world’s wealthy and away from riskier securities activities the swiss bank’s shares jumped to a month high boosted by higherthan expected quarterly earnings former prudential head thiam took over as head of the zurichbased lender only three weeks ago and investors have been watching for any clues on his plans as well as any hints of a widely expected move to tap shareholders for additional capital thiam said he was leading a strategic review and would set out a strategy before the end of the year but indicated it will focus on a move towards less volatile wealth management “we want to rebalance towards private banking and wealth management  as opposed to the investment bank” thiam told financial broadcaster cnbc frequent references to asia pacific in its earnings release also suggested expectations of a renewed focus on wealth management in the region could be well founded separately credit suisse’s asia chief said the bank would consider raising headcount or buying a smaller peer to build up its private banking business in a region where pretax profit doubled in the first half of this year one highranking credit suisse banker said thiam’s initial focus would be to scrutinise the bank’s existing businesses which soak up considerable capital this would mainly be in investment banking areas such as “macro” products which include the trading of interest ratelinked products and currencies and prime brokerage or dealing for hedge funds credit suisse will judge whether these areas help provide business to other units as well as looking at their cost of capital this would come before any attempt to tap shareholders for cash the person said talking to cnbc thiam left the door open for a fresh cash call “we need to look at what we need for growth these needs are determined whether we need to call for additional capital” thiam said “but i think i have a track record of generating capital and any capital that shareholders may put in they’ll get back many times” credit suisse bolstered its capital slightly in the second quarter to  of riskweighted assets from  although it still lags behind many rivals “you have to show at least  not to have a discount on your share price” said zuercher kantonalbank analyst andreas brun for the three months to  june credit suisse said net profit reached bn swiss francs £m compared with an average forecast of sfrm in a poll of six analysts credit
