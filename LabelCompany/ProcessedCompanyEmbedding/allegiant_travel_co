mciaverage ratingreviewsthe stewards were outstanding capable and friendly they were the one pleasant part of the experience the flight was a rough and bumpy flight but that was due to weather the air vents never started working in my row and it made for a quite warm and unpleasant flight i booked this flight last minute because of a death in the family my party and i were disappointed that the airline would not work with us to change flights and i feel it was not worth the money it was quite an expensive flight to make it back for a funeral other family members dealing with other airlines had much better experiences and were accommodated in their time of grief i feel like we were taken advantage of in a tough time where we had no other options when my sister asked to change her flight due to a death they said they required an obituary this was not available until the day of our flight in this day and age funerals happen very quickly and things like obituaries are not always available in time for travel i think this is a ridiculous requirement that is insensitivecarimemphis tn memphis international airport  fort lauderdale fl hollywood intl apt mem  fllfrom average
