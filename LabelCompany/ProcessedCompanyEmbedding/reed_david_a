stars out of  july   mrs monica osei this is an excellent book to read to find out the teachings of jehovahs witnesses it goes verse by verse and then it gives you an explanation of their belief and how to show them that their interpretation of the bible is incorrect i recommend you purchase this book if you know someone who is thinking about becoming a jehovahs witness or to give current jehovahs witnesses something to think about it is a must that you read it first before you try to witness to a jehovahs witness with this book you dont have to hide when they come knocking at your door was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate carol beal  stars out of  february   carol beal i really enjoyed this book it answered all of my questions about jesus god and the holy spirit jehovah witnesses should read this book it explains everything so well and shows you the scripture in the bible that supports the topic was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate scott moffatt  stars out of  september   scott moffatt this book is awesome the author is an exjw and can speak with authority to what they falsely teach and believe this book gives me confidence to defend biblical christianity and converse intelligently with well trained jws who seem to jump from verse to verse it explains why they believe what they believe and allows me to present the real truth awesome resource was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate jm hucks  stars out of  august   jm hucks an excellent reference for the beliefs of jws how those beliefs compare to christianity and how to combat the jw rapid fire versespewing approach to conversion i have an interest in apologetics and a friend thats a jw ive been frustrated at never knowing what to say to him or where to look in the bible to counter his arguments for his faith this book is definitely the answer not only does the author quote scripture but he also quotes watchtower literature that illustrates the contradictions and fallacies of the jw mindset its a small book and makes for a relatively quick and easy read or it can be used as a reference manual versebyverse setup if you are a christian who knows a jehovahs witness or a jehovahs witness who wants to know more about christianity or if you just want to be prepared next time they knock on your door buy this book was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate andrew  stars out of  december   andrew this book does an excellent job of showing just what the j ws believe
