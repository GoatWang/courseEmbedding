peoplesoft founder is back in business    back to gallery its a david duffieldversusgoliath rematch duffield rose to prominence building peoplesoft inc into a software powerhouse  celebrated for its rare combination of competitive edge and congenial culture  but lost control of his company to nemesis larry ellison chief executive officer of oracle corp in  after an month hostiletakeover battle now at  duffield is back in business this time hes making a bold attempt to challenge industry giants oracle and sap ag with ondemand software that allows customers to manage business tasks via the internet instead of installing costly programs on company computers in an interesting twist that means taking on the old peoplesoft products that oracle still sells and supports latest news videos workday his yearold venture in walnut creek faces significant challenges in a brutally competitive and crowded marketplace dominated by industry leaders and upandcoming startups but no one is discounting the possibility that this billionaire software legend might pull it off he is one of the most beloved bosses in bay area history so hes had no problem assembling top talent he has plenty of his own money to power workday and with his fifth startup he has the track record to schmooze even the most riskaverse corporations there arent that many people who would dream about building a set of applications to ultimately compete with sap and oracle said bruce richardson chief research officer at amr research but part of the attraction for customers is that it is a new way of doing things and its dave its like your favorite band or baseball team got all its best players back for a chance to do it all again most teams never get that chance dave is providing people with the dream of doing it a second time the question is will they do it analysts say duffields timing couldnt be better he is entering the software business just as corporations frustrated by years of wrangling with complex and expensive products have begun searching for a simpler way to automate their businesses young trailblazers like salesforcecom netsuite and rightnow technologies are encouraging companies to migrate to online software the approach has been gaining in popularity for the past eight years since former oracle executive marc benioff launched salesforcecom a subscription service that allows companies to manage sales leads on the web gambling on workday but analysts say workday is still a highstakes gambit chief among the challenges workday faces larger companies may not want software they cant customize in any way they please these companies may also be reluctant to entrust their most sensitive data to anyone no matter the security precautions neither sap nor oracle would comment on workday but at a news conference in palo alto earlier this month sap chief executive officer henning kagermann said that while his company is developing online software it wont be the ultimate answer for everyone duffield is betting kagermann is wrong duffields first  customers are small and midsize companies but his longrange ambition is to attract larger companies that typically invest tens of millions in software from oracle and sap he hopes to do that by offering a product that is easier and less expensive to use much faster to launch and offers more features workdays products have the look and feel of an internet site and helping to shape them are its early customers  like tom mcelroy director of human resources services for covad communications a employee broadband company in san jose to make his pitch directly to the mcelroys of the business world duffield took workday executives and customers on a oneweek road show hitting five cities with the final stop in san francisco i wanted to make this personal and explain why we are doing this duffield told  prospective customers that personal touch is vintage duffield who inspired as much loyalty in peoplesoft customers as he did in peoplesoft employees to wit duffield has two titles on his business card ceo and chief customer advocate customers are your best salespeople he said the higher the service levels you give a customer particularly during the formative years the more likely you will keep going and sell more business thats the kind of message that resonates with mcelroy who joined duffield at the road show in san francisco workday will revolutionize how covad does business mcelroy said its fun to be a part of the revolution if its a bona fide revolution its in its infancy dave loves this industry and he is clearly driven said citi investment research analyst brent thill ultimately he is going to make a really important mark on this industry as he did in the past but its early yet ironically duffield wouldnt be taking another turn at the silicon valley wheel of innovation if it were not for oracles ellison in  duffield a former ibm executive decided to mortgage his house to raise the money to start peoplesoft he was banking that there was a gold mine in the coming shift from mainframe computers to networked computers and in the growing demand for products to automate the backoffice functions at corporations from human resources to accounting he was right in  just as the trend began sweeping corporate america peoplesoft delivered its first product and a company culture that would bind staffers and customers to peoplesofts mission in  as peoplesoft stumbled in rough economic times duffield tapped a veteran technology executive craig conway to take over aneel bhusri once duffields heir apparent remained on the board but left peoplesoft to pursue a career in venture capital exit peoplesoft then oracle initiated a surprise hostile takeover in november  the peoplesoft board lost confidence in conway and fired him duffield emerged from retirement to rejoin forces with bhusri in a doomed effort to rescue peoplesoft by that time peoplesoft had  billion in annual revenue and  employees a phone call from bhusri on dec   broke the bad news after an month standoff peoplesofts board had voted to accept a  billion buyout a moment duffield recalls as the single most painful of his life the hardfought battle suddenly over duffield pledged  million to help peoplesoft employees laid off in the takeover and retreated to his tahoe home where he again turned his attention to supporting worthy causes and caring for his six adopted children but he soon discovered he did not want to settle back into the placid landscape just yet going back to peoplesoft those few months after a fiveyear hiatus got the business juices flowing again duffield said he and bhusri a partner with venture firm greylock partners began discussing the potential of online software to transform the businesssoftware market in late january  they met for breakfast at the truckee diner and resolved to form a startup we had all the ingredients for a potential success duffield said the market was springing up we had the technology we had the creamofthecrop talent we had a good reputation right out of the gate we felt we would be foolish not to try greylock partners leaped at the chance to invest in duffields second act as did workday and former peoplesoft board member skip battle together they have pumped  million into workday workday also recruited a key adviser silicon valley wunderkind marc andreessen the netscape cofounder who sparked the internet revolution with the first web browser a reenergized duffield dove into the startup with the boundless energy of his late schnauzer maddie who inspired him to endow a foundation to end euthanasia of stray dogs and cats dave and aneel did not come back for nostalgias sake battle said this isnt like attending a chubby checker concert that isnt very good but makes you marvel that the guy can do it at all this is the real deal daves next move workday attracted attention nearly from the getgo as rumors flew after the peoplesoft buyout that duffield might strike again duffield and bhusri got an important head start by purchasing peoplesoft alumni john malatesta and jim hopps company netyourwork which focused on easytouse web software for midsize companies petros dermetzis workdays vice president of development and its fifth employee created a web site daves next move to recruit developers and soon was flooded with resumes venture capitalists and journalists began knocking on the door of the startup that didnt yet have a name let alone a sign  and counting now workday has  employees spread out over a single floor in a downtown highrise  of whom were hired during the past four months they have all come to work for duffield who in a business dominated by bombastic personalities has distinguished himself with his unpretentious manner and disarming sense of humor both were on full display on a warm evening in may when duffield presided over a spirited quarterly meeting with his longtime friend and business partner bhusri together the workday cofounders fired up the crowd in typical fashion their presentation spent as much time skewering german software giant sap as it did celebrating the achievements of workdays first  employees a highlight was a photograph of monthold leni workbaby no  sitting on duffields lap leni is growing up with workday she attended the firstever companywide meeting in october  when she was just seven days old her parents workday employees ralf and laura schroeder are for the second time investing their careers in duffield the fatherly figure affectionately known by his initials dad the schroeders met at peoplesoft where their first daughter clara  peoplebaby no   was born   years ago in blue jeans and a denim shirt duffield energetically handed out plaques listing the names of all  of workdays first employees he showed off his trademark humor as he recognized employees with outstanding contributor awards receptionist betty landes took home a thick glossy catalog of all the cool perks duffield gets with his platinum frequentflier status duffield saved his zingers for employee no  jeff pulver a peoplesoft alum who among other assignments served time in siebel systems roughandtumble trenches before joining workday as vice president of marketing and business development no  two among the top  reasons workday hired pulver the amazing opportunity to leverage his experience building the happy fun corporate culture at siebel then pulver and duffields son mike vice president of sales brought the house down with their creative spoofs of the popular apple television commercials that contrast a mac hipster with a pc nerd in their version mike duffield plays an amiable nimble workday to pulvers stodgy bloated erp industry jargon for enterprise resource planning the kind of business software on which peoplesoft and its rivals sap and oracle built their fortunes employees roared their appreciation when pulver outfitted in a fat suit keels over and hollers ive fallen and i cant get up duffield heartily joined in there will be naysayers who say im too old or im shooting for something
