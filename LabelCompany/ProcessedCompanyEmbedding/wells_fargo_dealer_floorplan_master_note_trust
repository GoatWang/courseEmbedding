service moodys has assigned definitive ratings to the notes issued by navistar financial dealer note master owner trust ii series  notes navmot  the notes will be backed by dealer floorplan loans originated by navistar financial corporation nfc unrated who is also the sponsor and servicer of the transaction the complete rating actions are as follows issuer navistar financial dealer note master owner trust ii series   libor   class a floating rate dealer note asset backed notes definitive rating assigned aaa sf  libor   class b floating rate dealer note asset backed notes definitive rating assigned aa sf  libor   class c floating rate dealer note asset backed notes definitive rating assigned a sf  libor   class d floating rate dealer note asset backed notes definitive rating assigned baa sf ratings rationale the ratings are based on the quality of the underlying auto dealer floorplan receivables the strength of the capital structure and the experience and expertise of nfc as the servicer moodys aaa level for navmot  is  the aaa level is the level of credit enhancement consistent with a aaa sf rating moodys based the aaa level on an analysis of the quality of the floorplan receivables and the transactions structural features a primary consideration for assessing the quality of the floorplan receivables is the strength of the manufacturer and the vehicles to which the dealerships and the receivables have exposure moodys also considered the size of the dealership base that is part of navmot the overall trust monthly payment rate and the ability of nfc to perform servicing functions other factors driving our analysis of navmot include the transactions credit enhancement stepup triggers early amortization trigger and vehicle values under stressed scenarios at closing the class a notes class b notes class c notes and class d notes benefit from    and  of hard credit enhancement respectively hard credit enhancement for the notes consists of a combination of overcollateralization a nondeclining reserve account and subordination except for classs d which does not benefit from any subordination principal methodology the principal methodology used in these ratings was moodys approach to rating floorplan assetbacked securities published in ocotber  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology on  march  moodys released a request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance if the revised methodology is implemented as proposed the credit rating on navmot  is not expected to be affected please refer to moodys request for comment titled moodys proposes revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance for further details regarding the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain credit ratings factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings up moodys could upgrade the notes if levels of credit enhancement are higher than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of portfolio losses losses could decline from moodys original expectations as a result of a lower number of dealer defaults or appreciation in the value of the assets securing a dealers promise of payment additionally a strengthening credit profile of manufacturers andor dealers could decrease expectations for loss portfolio losses also depend greatly on us economic performance other reasons for betterthanexpected performance include changes to servicing practices that enhance collections down moodys could downgrade the notes if levels of credit enhancement are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of portfolio losses losses could rise above moodys original expectations as a result of a higher number of dealer defaults or deterioration in the value of the assets securing a dealers promise of payment additionally a weakening credit profile of manufacturers andor dealers could increase expectations for loss portfolio losses also depend greatly on us economic performance other reasons for worsethanexpected performance include poor servicing error on the part of transaction parties inadequate transaction governance and fraud stress scenarios as the loss and cash flow analysis section in the regulatory disclosures section describes below in our simulation analysis we assumed that navistar international corporation the manufacturer of the vehicles backing the receivables in this transaction was rated caa three notches below its current long term rating of b our simulation analysis incorporated a stressed average dealer default rate of approximately  on average our assumptions for recovery rates of repossessed vehicles from defaulted dealers is  for new vehicles and  for used vehicles average stressed recovery rates applied under manufacturer bankruptcy scenarios were generally between  and  with a low of  additional research including a presale report for this transaction is available at wwwmoodyscom regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomresearchdocumentcontentpageaspxdocidpbs the analysis relies on a monte carlo simulation that generates a large number of collateral loss or cash flow scenarios which on average meet key metrics moodys determines based on its assessment of the collateral characteristics moodys then evaluates each simulated scenario using model that replicates the relevant structural features and payment allocation rules of the transaction to derive losses or payments for each rated instrument the average loss a rated instrument incurs in all of the simulated collateral loss or cash flow scenarios which moodys weights based on its assumptions about the likelihood of events in such scenarios actually occurring results in the expected loss of the rated instrument moodys describes the stress scenarios it has considered for this rating action in the section ratings rationale of this press release for ratings issued on a program
