prospective investors should consider an investment in the units only as a longterm investment prospective investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties  described below as well as all of the other information included in this  offering circular before deciding whether to purchase any units any of the  following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the fund  and its overall financial condition and therefore could negatively impact  the value of an investment prospective investors should not invest in the  units unless they can afford to lose the investment made with the fund risks related to the companys business and business model  tuscan gardens design concept the design concept upon which tuscan gardens is premised includes as the centerpiece of the residence an open community kitchen accessible to all residents there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to bring that design concept to fruition to its fullest based on health safety and other laws rules regulations and standards applicable to the structure and its intended use  lack of operating history the fund and its affiliated entities have no operating history the fund is using an unproven business model and cannot guarantee that the business model is appropriate to the implementation of its business plan  unproven revenue and profit potential of our business model because the business model is unproven as to the sizes of the assisted living and memory care units and the combination of the two of them both the revenue and profit potential of the fund are uncertain if the fund meets its revenue expectations there is no guarantee that the fund will be profitable or that costs will not  continue to exceed revenue  the revenue is dependent upon one tenant the properties will have one tenant there is a risk that tenant will not be able to maintain necessary occupancy levels in one or more of the properties and there is no guarantee that tenant will be profitable there is a risk that tenant will be unable to pay the rent as it comes due if the rent is not paid as it comes due the fund may not be able to pay the normal recurring operating expenses of the properties andor the required monthly loan payments the risk of being unable to pay the recurring operating expenses and the required monthly loan payment is that the fund at the extreme could face foreclosure on one or more of the properties or in a lesser case the projected cash distributions will not be able to be made  lack of tenant operational history for properties the properties have not yet been identified purchased developed or constructed and are not in operation at this time and it is  not possible to determine if the properties will be profitable if the properties are not profitable the tenant could cease operating the locations and cease rent payments if the rents are not paid as they come due the fund may not be able to pay the normal recurring operating expenses of the properties as are required andor the required monthly loan payments the risk of being unable to pay the recurring operating expenses and the required monthly loan payment is that the fund at the extreme could face foreclosure on one or more of the properties or in a lesser case the projected cash distributions will not be able to be made  licensing requirements the assisted living component of tuscan gardens as well as the memory care component each requires a license from various states to operate while the fund manager believes that it will obtain those licenses there can be no assurances that the licenses will either be issued or be issued on a timely basis  risks of having no control in management under the operating agreement preferred members do not have a right to participate in the management of the funds affairs preferred members cannot propose changes to the manager or to the operating agreement under the operating agreement it may also be difficult for preferred members to enforce claims against the manager which means that preferred members may not be able to recover any losses they may suffer through their ownership of units arising from acts of the manager that harm the funds business the manager and its management must discharge their duties with reasonable care in good faith and in the best interest of the fund despite this obligation the operating agreement limits managements liability to the fund and all members the manager is not liable for monetary damages unless it involves receipt of an improper personal financial benefit a willful failure to deal fairly with the fund on matters where there is a material conflict of interest a knowing violation of law or willful misconduct any members ability to bring legal action against the manager for these actions is also limited members may only bring a legal action on behalf of the fund if it has refused to bring the action or an effort to cause the manager to bring the action is not likely to succeed  members must rely on the manager for management of the business the manager will make all decisions with respect to the management of the fund preferred members will have no right or power to take part in the management of the fund therefore they will be relying entirely on the manager for management of the fund and the operation of its business the manager may not be removed under the operating agreement  certain affiliates of the manager shall determine what is in the best interests of the fund and its members certain individuals control the majority of the membership interests of the manager therefore these individuals will have a dominant role in determining what is in the best interests of the fund since no person other than these individuals has any direct control over management of the fund it does not have the benefit of independent consideration of issues affecting its operations therefore these individuals will determine the propriety of their own actions which could result in a conflict of interest and a risk to the viability and success of the fund when they are faced with any significant decisions relating to the affairs of the fund  voting rights are limited under the operating agreement as  well as under the florida revised limited liability company act  the manager only may take the following significant actions a to amend the operating agreement b to change the funds business purpose or the investment objectives c to sell the funds properties d to authorize a merger of the fund or e to authorize the dissolution of the fund preferred members will not have the right to vote on any matters that the current members may vote on other than those which attempt to change or modify the rights and privileges as a preferred member in addition the florida revised limited liability company act does not grant preferred members any other specific voting rights  indemnification of manager and management corporation the  operating agreement provides indemnification of the manager and  the management corporation the fund is bound to indemnify and  hold the manager and the management corporation harmless for any  acts done or omitted to be done under the authority granted to  the manager and the management corporation except in the case of  bad faith willful or intentional misconduct gross negligence  reckless conduct or a knowing violation of law this  indemnification will provide the members with a more limited  right of action against the manager and the management corporation  than they would have if the indemnification were not in the  operating agreement risks related to the offering  arbitrary determination of the offering price the offering price has been arbitrarily determined by the manager and may not bear any relationship to assets acquired or to be acquired or the book value of the company or any other established criteria or quantifiable indicia for valuing a business neither the company nor the manager represents that the units have or will have a market value equal to their offering price or that the units could be resold if at all at their original offering price  breaking escrow the fund may break escrow when twentyfive  units have been sold and the fund has received investment funds therefor of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to sell the remaining offered units at any price  no market for units there is a risk that no market for the units will ever exist and as a result the investment in the fund is illiquid in the event the member desires to liquidate their interest if a member attempts to sell their units prior to the dissolution of the fund there is no certainty that they can be sold for full market value or that the units may be sold at any price  investment risk there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to achieve its investment objectives or that members will receive any return of their capital investment results may vary substantially over time and as a result investors should understand that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future periods  risk of inability to obtain financing there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to obtain financing under these terms for the acquisition development andor construction of the properties or that any such financing will not exceed seventyfive percent  of the value of the completed properties  fund intends to use leverage the funds objectives include the use of leverage in the acquisition development construction and operation of the properties if the fund does obtain financing the use of leverage increases the risk of an investment in the units as it is possible that the rental income from the properties in any month will be inadequate to make the monthly debt service required on the financing obtained a result of being unable to make the required financing payments could be that the lender could complete a foreclosure and all of the investment in the units will be lost there is also the risk that at the time of the sale of the properties the sales proceeds will not be greater than the amount needed to pay off the remaining balance of the financing and as a result no cash will be available for distribution to the members  lack of capital there is a risk that the amount of capital to be raised by the fund will be insufficient to meet the investment objectives of the fund if there is a shortage of capital the manager will use best efforts to obtain funds from a third party obtaining funds from a third party may require an increase in the amount of financing the fund will be obligated to repay in addition there is no certainty that funds from a third party will be available at a reasonable cost if available at all  general economic conditions may affect the value and the timing of sales of fund properties or the ability to finance the properties the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions the availability of financing interest rates and other factors including the supply and demand for real estate investments all of which are beyond the control of the fund the fund cannot predict whether it will be able to sell its properties for a price or on terms which are acceptable further the fund cannot predict its ability to obtain adequate funding from a third party lender to purchase any property there are no assurances that the fund can successfully achieve its investment goals and therefore investors may have to hold their units for an indefinite period of time or have their units sold or redeemed for less than the preferred members capital investment  environmentally hazardous property under various federal  state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a  current or previous owner or operator of real property may be  liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic  substances on under or in such property such laws often impose  liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was  responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances  environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in  which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these  restrictions may require expenditures environmental laws provide for  sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by  governmental agencies or in certain circumstances by private parties  in connection with the ownership of the properties the fund may be  potentially liable for such costs the cost of defending against claims  of liability complying with environmental regulatory requirements or  remediating any contaminated property could materially adversely affect  the value of the funds properties and the units  real estate investments are longterm investments and may be  difficult to sell in response to changing economic conditions virtually all real property investments are subject to certain  inherent risks real estate investments are generally longterm  investments which cannot be quickly be converted to cash real  property investments are also subject to adverse changes in general  economic conditions or local conditions which may reduce the demand  for commercial property  limited operating reserves the fund intends to establish an  operating reserve account with a portion of the proceeds raised from  this offering to pay anticipated operating administrative and other  expenses that shall be incurred following the closing date of this  offering if future expenses increase by unanticipated amounts the  fund may not have sufficient reserves to pay these obligations the  fund does not currently have any commitment or arrangement in place  to obtain additional funding and there are no assurances that  additional funding can be obtained if necessary or that such  additional funding if obtained will be adequate for its financial  needs  legal tax and regulatory risks legal tax and regulatory  changes could occur during the lifetime of the fund that may  adversely impact the fund its taxation status and any distributions  to members  tax liability may exceed cash distribution from the disposition  there is a risk that on the disposition of the properties the tax  liability may exceed the distributable cash available in the event of  a foreclosure or other involuntary disposition of the properties  there is the possibility that a member may have a larger tax liability  than the amount of cash available for distribution at the time of the  event or at any time in the future  risk of audit of members returns there is a risk that an audit  of the funds records could trigger an audit of the individual members  tax records risk related to conflicts of interest  manager or management corporation may be involved in similar  investments the manager or the management corporation or their  affiliates may act as managers in other limited liability companies  engaged in making similar investments and intend to act as the managers  of new limited liability companies to be formed  manager or management corporation may have interests in similar  properties the manager or the management corporation or their affiliates
