the assassination of president kennedy in  martin was among the few close kennedy advisors to successfully make the transition to the new administration of president lyndon b johnson in  as a trusted advisor martin was influential in president johnson’s decision to nominate thurgood marshall as the first black justice of the united states supreme court of his close working relationship with johnson it was said that they talked to each other in the shorthand of experienced political pros according to clifford alexander special white house counsel and the first africanamerican secretary of the united states army secretary alexander regarded martin as his mentor among the other leading black public figures whom martin helped raise to prominence was vernon e jordan jr later a close
