to disinvestment in bank branches to the detriment of consumers who prioritised inperson service “other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the highcost delivery channel they wanted to push them online we totally reject that you can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…we have some branches that get  customer visits a month the average branch gets  an average mcdonald’s gets  per month” hill’s motto for commerce was “america’s most convenient bank” commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume differentiation and customer advocacy including longer opening hours including evenings and weekends opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours removing glass from teller booths for a

loyalty through service rather than price speaking to a  house of commons treasury select committee on competition and choice in the banking sector hill said “my opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…if you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…organic growth is slower but you get what you want at the end you get a group of people running your model not somebody else’s model…” hill is a critic of the shadow banking system believing it to largely responsible for the  global financial crisis “we have two american banking systems we have the normal banking system with  banks serving consumers and businesses throughout america then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds the investment banks the credit default swaps the current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system…i think when banks are making a loan to say a restaurant the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games as long as the guy’s paying it’s a loan that pays back over time then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps cdos believe me no one at goldman sachs understands what they have on their books because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up…” hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business “you dont have to think about what time a home depot a mcdonalds or a starbucks is open” hill says “theyre open you just go my theory was if you advertise that your bank is open

delivering an unusual service acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…organic growth is slower but you get what you want at the end you get a group of people running your model not somebody else’s model…” hill is a critic of the shadow banking system believing it to largely responsible for the  global financial crisis “we have two american banking systems we have the normal banking system with  banks serving consumers and businesses throughout america then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds the investment banks the credit default swaps the current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system…i think when banks are making a loan to say a restaurant the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games as long as the guy’s paying it’s a loan that pays back over time then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps cdos believe me no one at goldman sachs understands what they have on their books because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up…” hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business “you dont have to think about

delivering an unusual service acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…organic growth is slower but you get what you want at the end you get a group of people running your model not somebody else’s model…” hill is a critic of the shadow banking system believing it to largely responsible for the  global financial crisis “we have two american banking systems we have the normal banking system with  banks serving consumers and businesses throughout america then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds the investment banks the credit default swaps the current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system…i think when banks are making a loan to say a restaurant the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games as long as the guy’s paying it’s a loan that pays back over time then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps cdos believe me no one at goldman sachs understands what they have on their books because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up…” hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business “you dont have to think about

contents  early career  commerce bancorp  petplan  metro bank  book  other investments  business philosophy  personal life  references early careeredit although known for banking hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing while taking morning classes at wharton hill worked afternoons at a south jersey bank owned by a local car retailer where hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations such as late opening hours the job also brought hill into contact with other local retailers including mcdonalds after graduation hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for mcdonalds a task which required hill to drive mcdonalds entrepreneur ray kroc on scouting trips hill claims his experience with mcdonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing philadelphia magazine reports that hill’s experience with mcdonald’s led directly to the creation of commerce bank referring to the creation of commerce morton kerr chairman of the board of markeimchalmers inc a south jersey real estate firm and one of the original commerce board members observed “a lot of us knew vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…he was a yearold kid who called about  of us to a meeting in his office ill never forget it he said were going to start a bank and he said wed each have to put up between  and  this was who had that kind of money but hed arranged for all of us to borrow it if you could put up  he got us loans for  only seven of us didnt get up and walk out but we still thought he was crazy” the deal resulted in commerce opening its first branch in marlton new jersey in  commerce bancorpedit commerce bank was notable for its rapid expansion from one branch in  to  branches in  and a deposit base that grew by an average of  per year between  and  against an industry average of  in  according to forbes magazine commerce produced a  annual shareholder return compounded for  years commerce bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch additionally hill believed that the industrys reliance on internet banking had led to disinvestment in bank branches to the detriment of consumers who prioritised inperson service “other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the highcost delivery channel they wanted to push them online we totally reject that you can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…we have some branches that get  customer visits a month the average branch gets  an average mcdonald’s gets  per month” hill’s motto for commerce was “america’s most convenient bank” commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume differentiation and customer advocacy including longer opening hours including evenings and weekends opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience petfriendly policies giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits free use of coincounting machines handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks “kill the stupid rule” program whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid  commerce bank staff were awarded  if a nearby rival bank closed its branches hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores topperforming managers were given sports cars on june   hill resigned as chairman and ceo of commerce bancorp after the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve bank of philadelphia and the board of directors of commerce bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the

will be hugecitation needed metro bankedit metro bank uk was launched in london july  with hill as cofounder and vicechairman press commentary at the time centred on metro being the first highstreet bank to open in the united kingdom for more than  years and upon hills belief that the competitive landscape of british banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price in   of the uk market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions hsbc barclays royal bank of scotland santander and lloyds in  an official report from the office of fair trading concluded that uk banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profitmaximising strategies forbes magazine described metro at launch as aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players in a bbc news interview thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional british banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches whereas metro bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches using tactics such as longer opening hours and petfriendly policies the pair spent a further two years securing a £m launch investment including funds from new york real estate developer richard lefrak property investors the reuben brothers and fidelity the fund management company metro launched with plans to open  branches in london by  twelve branches were opened by december  in june  the company announced the completion of a £m round of capitalraising to open further branches in london including funds from moore capital and billionaire investor steve cohen noted investor wilbur ross commented that the question is whether hill’s promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space hill who previously served as metros vice chairman replaced his cofounder anthony thomson as chairman in january  as of september  metro had  accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening  by the close of the year in may metro opened a drivethrough bank in slough the second in the uk after natwest in toxteth liverpool which opened in  but has since closed in  in april  hill was also awarded the institute of economic affairs free enterprise award whose previous winners include margaret thatcher and sir richard branson for his work at metro the iea noted hill has identified a clear opportunity and entered the uk banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire and showed incredible perseverance and imagination while iea director general mark littlewood praised metro bank as a shining example of innovation improving peoples live its refreshing to see more competition

hill along with partners john silvestri and steve lewis founded and developed galloway national golf club near atlantic city new jersey the course was designed by tom fazio and is ranked by golfdigestcom as being among the top  courses in americacitation needed business philosophyedit fortune magazine describes hill as a “flamboyant traditionstomping american billionaire…the pt barnum of banking” hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price speaking to a  house of commons treasury select committee on competition and choice in the banking sector hill said “my opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…if you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…organic growth is slower but you get what you want at the end you get a group of people running your model not somebody else’s model…” hill is a critic of the shadow banking system believing it to largely responsible for the  global financial crisis “we have two american banking systems we have the normal banking system with  banks serving consumers and businesses throughout america then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds the investment banks the credit default swaps the current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system…i think when banks are making a loan to say a restaurant the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games as long as the guy’s paying it’s a loan that pays back over time then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps cdos believe me no one at goldman sachs understands what they have on their books because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up…” hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business “you dont have to think about what time a home depot a mcdonalds or a starbucks is open” hill says “theyre open you just go my theory was if you advertise that your bank is open on sunday the consumer will automatically believe youre open all the time that message is more important than the savings in its   club forbes magazine lists hill as one of seven ceos along with warren buffett and larry ellison of publicly traded companies with tenures of over  years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of  commerce produced a  annual compounded shareholder return over that time personal lifeedit hill is the son

him as chairman and chief executive effective july how mr hill rose to become so influential a figure in new jersey business and politics is the story of an ambitious real estate developer who

rights project camden civil rights project search search for tag archives vernon w hill ii archives camden news archives corporate responsibility a banker’s last day at the office in a bank he built aggressively september   lawrence christopher skufca jd leave a comment   published july   by jeremy w peters and eric dash moorestown nj july  — there are no grand sendoffs planned no speeches either in fact vernon w hill ii who founded commerce bank  years ago is not even planning to go to the office on tuesday faced with a federal threat of not being allowed to open any more bank branches unless he stepped aside the board members of commerce bancorp which mr hill handpicked voted last month to remove him as chairman and chief executive effective july  how mr hill rose to become so influential a figure in new jersey business and politics is the story of an ambitious real estate developer who cultivated powerful friends as he built a network of burger kings and then banks across the state it is also a story of pride and excess “it’s a greek tragedy” said allen starkie an executive recruiter at knightsbridge advisers who lured several senior managers to commerce “vernon was an incredibly gifted protagonist who challenged the fates and won but he developed such extreme hubris that in the end it undermined his success” mr hill’s career has been defined more than anything else by a willingness to defy the establishment he founded commerce with a plan to make retail banking more like retail shopping opening spacious branches when the rest of the industry was scaling back and in the highly regulated world of public corporations he openly awarded tens of millions of dollars of contracts to friends and relatives including about  million for his wife who decorated and designed many of the nearly  branches in moorestown the wellheeled south jersey town he calls home he built a squarefoot tuscanstyle mansion where a farmhouse once stood construction of the home complete with a squarefoot gym and fountains inside and out so alienated his neighbors that moorestown established a historic preservation commission but last month the establishment pushed back under the terms of a ceaseanddesist order with federal bank regulators commerce agreed to stop signing contracts that entangled the bank with businesses run by its board members officers and members of their families but his troubles have not ended there the federal office of the comptroller of the currency the bank’s primary regulator says it is continuing to look into possible insider dealing at commerce and two people close to the investigation say the yearold mr hill is at the center of the examination mr hill’s lawyer robert s bennett said in a telephone interview that his client did not believe he had done anything improper “i can’t believe that he would ever put his interests above those of the bank” mr bennett said noting that the business deals in question were all publicly disclosed “these things were done in the sunshine” mr hill declined to be interviewed for this article this was not commerce bank’s first brush with the law in  a federal grand jury indicted two commerce executives glenn k holck and stephen m umbrell on charges of giving loans to the philadelphia city treasurer in exchange for the city’s financial business in  the two executives were convicted of conspiracy and the treasurer was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy although investigators disclosed that they had taped mr hill talking about business with the treasurer mr hill was never charged the son of a prosperous virginia real estate developer mr hill ran the bank as if it were his own personal patronage system he hired numerous people with deep connections to new jersey municipal and state governments and then he hired their relatives he befriended george e norcross iii one of new jersey’s most influential democratic politicians and appointed him chief executive of commerce bank’s insurance business the bank has done business for more than  years with the law firm in which mr norcross’s brother is a managing partner and last year it paid the firm  million for legal services a move the bank said in a regulatory filing was not approved by the board ever since he opened the first commerce branch in marlton nj in  at the age of  mr hill was a selfstyled maverick with little patience for tradition owner of more than  burger kings he brought a retail mindset to the banking industry which never operated that way when rivals were closing their branches commerce aggressively opened new “stores” as mr hill called them and kept them open long past the closing times of other banks today it is new jersey’s largest bank and has reached into new york city washington and palm beach fla in light of its recent legal troubles commerce has scaled back plans to open new branches this year from  to about  as its presence in the state grew so did its political influence today the commerce board includes not only mr norcross but also a former senate president and acting governordonald t difrancesco who came on in  and a former chairman of the ocean county republican party joseph buckelew on the same day in  mr hill purchased the insurance businesses of both mr norcross and mr buckelew and folded them into commerce as much as mr hill’s departure from commerce raises questions about how the bank based in cherry hill nj will fare without its founder — analysts have already speculated that it will soon be sold — it also raises questions about the possible collateral damage to mr norcross “the power in south jersey has been george norcross” said senator raymond j lesniak a democratic senator from union county and former chairman of the budget and appropriations committee “vernon was just part of the political empire built by george norcross” as alene ammond a former democratic senator in new jersey who has clashed publicly with mr norcross put it “they formed a cartel it was a very happy marriage with george norcross’s clout as a political boss he then paved the way throughout the state for them to establish themselves with bonds insurance — town by town county by county” in the late s and early s commerce bank was the largest underwriter of municipal bonds in new jersey indeed by  it was underwriting more than half of them even as its bond business grew commerce was making contributions to democratic and republican politicians alike through its political action committees it stopped making the political donations in  as wall street analysts and others questioned whether they created conflicts of interest as far back as  a state grand jury was investigating whether the design company operated by mr hill’s wife shirley was awarded business from camden county where mr norcross was then the democratic party chairman when the grand jury subpoenaed phone records the county said they were inadvertently destroyed neither mrs hill nor any county official was ever charged the business arrangement at commerce that has attracted the most scrutiny is its relationship with interarch the architectural and design company owned by mrs hill over the past decade the bank has paid the company about  million to design and furnish bank branches last year alone it paid mrs hill  million for her services in addition to her role as the bank’s chief interior designer mrs hill became the bank’s de facto protocol officer making surprise inspections — sometimes with her yorkie sir duffield in tow — to ensure that employees were complying with company standards mrs hill and her husband shared a flare for the flamboyant at christmas he has held lavish parties at their home villa collina with a different theme and food in each room after being greeted by trumpeters and served canapés while broadway entertainers performed the bank held annual “wow awards” to honor its best employees renting out radio city music hall for a night of festivities for hundreds of workers with mr hill escorted to the stage arminarm with two sequined rockettes mr hill’s neighbors are familiar with his grand scale when the couple was building their mansion on a wooded  acres here they complained of a parade of construction vehicles earth movers dump trucks water tankers to fill the artificial ponds on the property then there were the helicopters overhead at all hours one neighbor said she asked why the helicopters were necessary and was told by a construction worker it was so mrs hill could give orders to construction crews through a megaphone “i work at home and when i say there was one dump truck a minute going in and out i’m not kidding” said jeannie roulet a quilt maker who lives on the street the hills use to get to their service entrance “i have the cracks in our plaster to prove it” visit our multicultural art gallery lee jungseob korea seong moy china elizabeth catlett united states romare bearden united states
