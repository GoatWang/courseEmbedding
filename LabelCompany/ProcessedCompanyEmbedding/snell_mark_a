and other motorized vehicles special note to helmet users there are four reasons for you to be interested in this standard     the use of motorcycles and other motorized vehicles imposes risks of death or permanent impairment due to head injury     the proper use of protective helmets can minimize the risk of death or permanent impairment      the protective capacity of a helmet is difficult to estimate particularly at the time of purchase or use   protective capability is currently measured by destructive testing which is beyond the means of most helmet wearers     snell certification backed by ongoing destructive testing samples taken randomly from dealers and distributors identifies those helmet models providing and maintaining the highest levels of head protection four of the most critical elements affecting a helmets protective properties are     impact management  how well the helmet protects against collisions with large objects     helmet positional stability  whether the helmet will be in place on the head when its needed     retention system strength  whether the chin straps are sufficiently strong to hold the helmet throughout a head impact     extent of protection  the area of the head protected by the helmet             this standard describes simple tests for all four of these items  however the tests for the second item helmet stability of necessity presume that the helmet is well matched to the wearers head and that it has been carefully adjusted to obtain the best fit possible  unless you take similar care in the selection and fitting of your own helmet you may not obtain the level of protection that current headgear can provide             the foundation recommends the simple straightforward procedure recommended to consumers by most helmet manufacturers             position the helmet on your head so that it sits low on your forehead if you cant see the edge of the brim at the extreme upper range of your vision the helmet is probably out of place  adjust the retention system so that when in use it will hold the helmet firmly in place  this positioning and adjusting should be repeated to obtain the very best result possible  the procedure initially may be time consuming  take the time             try to remove the helmet without undoing the retention system closures  if the helmet comes off or shifts over your eyes readjust and try again  if no adjustment seems to work this helmet is not for you try another             this procedure is also the basis of the test for helmet stability described in this standard  this test performs the same steps but uses standard head forms  however you must still perform this procedure for yourself when buying a helmet and every time you wear a helmet  only in this way will you be able to make all the proper adjustments to get the best fit possible  furthermore your test on your own head will be an improvement on ours you will determine whether the helmet is appropriate for you personally             there are several other important aspects of helmets to consider  full face helmets provide a measure of protection from facial injuries  these helmets incorporate a rigid chin guard which covers the lower part of the face  the foundation has devised special tests for the chin bars of full face helmets              there are two varieties of full face helmets the chin guard may be an integral immovable part of the helmet but in socalled “modular” or “flipup” helmets the chin guard may be hinged so that when released it will pivot or flip up and out of the way for the rider’s convenience modular helmets must meet all the same requirements as those equipped with integral chin bars with the additional requirement that the chin guard release mechanism must be sufficiently secure to prevent inadvertent opening in a crash impact              some helmets come with a separate structure which bolts to the helmet and which is intended to cover the lower part of the face  these removable chin bars are often intended to deflect small stones and debris encountered in some motorcycle sports and may not be effective facial protection in falls and accidents  the foundation does not test bolton chin bars and considers any headgear equipped with them to be an open face helmet             if a full face helmet is equipped with a face shield it may also provide a measure of eye protection  the foundation tests the face shields of full face helmets for particle penetration resistance  face shields provided with open face helmets generally do not provide the same levels of eye protection and for that reason are not considered             the shells of both open and full face helmets should also provide a measure of protection from penetration  the foundation tests the shells of both full and open face helmets for penetration resistance             effective headgear must be removable  paramedics and other emergency personnel must be able to quickly remove headgear from accident victims in order to check for vital signs and to perform emergency procedures  the foundation has devised tests and criteria for helmet removability             the foundation tests helmets for visual field  the helmet must provide a minimum range of vision appropriate to its use as measured on standard head forms  most snell certified helmets will meet the requirements stated in this standard and are considered appropriate for street use  however the foundation may also certify headgear with much more restricted visual fields for use only in carefully controlled competitive environments  such headgear will include warning labels identifying them as appropriate only for certain activities              be absolutely certain that your helmet is appropriate for your intended uses  furthermore since the range of vision you obtain may vary considerably from our measurement be absolutely certain that the helmet and face shield permit you adequate vision             there are several important factors which the foundation does not consider directly but which bear on the effectiveness of protective helmets  be certain your helmet is wearable that is that it’s comfortable and adequately ventilated when worn for prolonged periods  few people will wear an uncomfortable helmet  a helmet that is not worn wont protect anyone  also while you’re trying the helmet on take a good look in a mirror and ask some friends what they think  most people will quit using an ugly helmet much more quickly than one that is merely uncomfortable             check for conspicuity  bright colors and reflective patches will make you more visible to others and therefore less likely to be involved in a collision  all your riding gear and especially your helmet should be unmistakable even to the most inattentive driver                                                                         foreword             in a motorcycle accident the rider may suffer injury or death  helmets on the market today offer varying degrees of protection but the consumer has little basis for judging the relative effectiveness of a given model  this standard presents rational methods for identifying those helmet models which definitely meet specified standards for impact crash protection and retention system strength and afterwards identifying  those which definitely have ceased to meet those standards              the snell foundation urges that protective helmets be required for all individuals participating in supervised racing events and encourages the general public to wear helmets which meet appropriate performance standards             this  standard establishes performance characteristics suitable for motorcycling and for use with other open motorized vehicles in which the driver and passengers may not be enclosed such as boats motorized carts allterrain vehicles and snowmobiles  this standard does not establish construction and material specifications  the foundation does not recommend specific materials or designs  manufacturers voluntarily submit helmets to be tested to this standard and if the submitted helmets pass a certification is issued             the foundation will make available the identity of those products which have been snell certified but will not attempt to rank those products according to performance nor to any other criteria  neither does the foundation distinguish between the needs of participants in competitive events and those of the general public             all of the requirements described herein including both initial certification and random sample testing are an integral part of this standard  no helmet can satisfy the standard unless it is subject to both certification and random sample testing by the foundation             snell certification for protective headgear requires a specific contractual agreement between the primary headgear manufacturer and the foundation  certification procedures may be obtained upon application to the foundation             snell memorial foundation is a registered certification mark and m is a certification mark of the snell memorial foundation                                                                      introduction             this standard addresses the problem of protecting the head from direct impact with surfaces or objects that might be encountered in a motorcycling accident  the standard prescribes direct measures of several factors bearing on a helmets ability to protect the head as well as its general serviceability as motorcyclist headgear  thus this standard is directed towards the kinds of performance bearing on head protection that may not readily be discernable by even knowledgeable consumers at the time of purchase             some of these performance requirements have been expressed in terms of limitations on the various components and features of the single general helmet configuration currently available  these expressions have been used only for the sake of clarity and should not be misinterpreted as requiring specific configurations or materials  as newer helmet technologies appear these limitations will be reexamined and perhaps restated             a motorcycle helmet consists generally of a rigid head covering and a retention system composed of flexible straps and hardware  the rigid covering consists of a strong stiff outer shell and a crushable liner  the stiff outer shell protects by its capacity to spread a concentrated load at its outer surface over a larger area of the liner and the wearers head  the crushable liner protects the head from direct impact by its capacity to manage impact energy   since there is no certain way to anticipate the severity of a head impact or whether the impact surface will be such that it will spread the load over the helmet or concentrate it at a single point the most generally effective helmet will combine the strongest stiffest possible outer shell with a liner chosen to limit the peak deceleration of the wearer’s head to within tolerable limits             the retention system holds the headgear in position throughout normal usage and especially during falls and accidents ensuring that the helmet will be in place to manage a direct impact  this standard applies two different tests to the retention system  the first of these tests for stability by fitting the headgear to a standard head form and then attempting to displace it by applying tangential shock loadings  the second tests retention system strength by applying a shock load to the system components through a simulated chin             the quality of the fit and the care taken with the adjustments are absolutely critical elements in these tests  the manufacturer must provide suitable guidance so that the wearer will be able to select and adjust headgear to obtain the necessary quality of fit and positional stability             the capacity for impact protection is determined by direct measurement of the shock delivered through the helmet to a head form when the helmeted head form is dropped in a specified manner onto any of three unyielding anvils              most motorcycle helmets are intended to accommodate a range of head sizes and shapes  various thicknesses of resilient padding are sometimes placed within otherwise identical helmets during production or during fitting to configure the helmet to several different ranges of head size  this resilient padding does not significantly affect the way the helmet absorbs and attenuates impact and is not directly addressed in this standard             the helmet must also resist penetration by sharp edged and pointed projections and projectiles  this capacity is tested by placing the helmet on a head form and dropping a metal cone of specified mass and geometry onto the shell  the tip of this cone must not penetrate to the head form             similarly the helmets must resist chemical attack by bodily fluids as well as solvents and chemicals associated with motorsports  this capacity may be tested by applying a solvent mix before further conditioning and testing             full face helmets including “modular” or “flipup” helmets provide a measure of facial protection in addition to the impact protection generally sought  the principle feature of these is a chin bar that extends forward to cover the jaw area converting the facial opening into a visual port  frequently a face shield is also provided so that the wearers face is completely covered             in traditional full face helmets the chin bar is an integral immovable part of the helmet structure  in “modular” or “flipup” full face configurations the chin bar may be released to pivot about a hinge up and away from the face enabling wearers to adjust eyeglasses eat drink or converse when not actually riding  although other helmets may be configured to allow the use of “bolton” chin bar elements these helmets are not considered to be full face and are treated instead as open face configurations             for full face helmets this standard tests the rigidity of the chin bar by dropping a weight onto it at a specified velocity so as to attempt to force the chin bar toward the interior of the helmet  the chin bar must not deflect more than a specified amount             if a face shield is provided with a full face helmet then this face shield must resist penetration by small particles  a sharp lead pellet of a specified weight is directed into the face shield at a specified velocity  the pellet must not penetrate into the helmet interior             this standard also includes a test intended to determine whether the headgear may be removed from an unconscious accident victim quickly easily and reliably in spite of any damage the headgear might reasonably be expected to sustain  traditional helmet architectures have satisfied this requirement so readily that many standards including previous snell foundation standards have not mentioned it  even so it is unthinkable that a headgear might protect its wearer in an accident only to thwart attempts at rescue afterward             inadequate ventilation may render a helmet unwearable in hot climates especially if the helmet is full faced  but this standard makes no direct demands on either the quantity or quality of air flow to the wearer             other general features of motorcycle helmets may include eyeshades and accommodations for goggles and visibility enhancements such as bright colors and reflective surfaces  these features all deal with matters of safety and comfort that are not directly addressed in this standard but which merit the consideration of wearers as well as manufacturers              although helmet use has been shown to reduce the risk of head injuries significantly there are limits to a helmets protective capability  no helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable accidents  therefore injury may occur in accidents which exceed the protective capability of any helmet including even those helmets meeting the requirements of this standard             a helmets protective capability may be exhausted protecting the wearer in an accident  helmets are constructed so that the energy of a blow is managed by the helmet causing its partial destruction  the damage may not be readily apparent and the foundation strongly recommends that a helmet involved in an accident be returned to the manufacturer for complete inspection  if it is not possible to do so the helmet should always be destroyed and replaced             finally the protective capability may diminish over time  some helmets are made of materials which deteriorate with age and therefore have a limited life span  at the present time the foundation recommends that motorcycle helmets be replaced after five  years or less if the manufacturer so recommends                                                                     construction a  general             the assembled helmet shall have smooth external and internal surfaces  any feature projecting more than  mm beyond the outer surface must readily break away all other projections on the outer surface shall be smoothly faired and offer minimal frictional resistance to tangential impact forces  rivets and similar projections into the helmet interior must offer no laceration or puncture hazard  restraint clips may be used at the rear or on the side of the helmet  the helmet shall provide as nearly uniform impact protection over the entire protected area as is possible             if the absence of any detachable component of the helmet does not prevent its being worn then this absence must not compromise either the retention system or the impact protection  if any part of the helmet detaches during testing it must offer no laceration or puncture hazard nor reduce the coverage of the head             if the manufacturer provides addons such as visors face shields and neck curtains with the helmet these addons must not lessen the protective capability of the basic helmet nor reduce the visual field below standard requirements nor create a direct hazard for the wearer b  shell             if rivets are used the heads shall not have sharp edges and shall not project more than  mm from the outer surface of the helmet c  materials             ideally materials used in the manufacture of the helmet should be of durable quality and not be harmed by exposure to sun rain dust vibration sweat or products applied to the skin or hair  similarly the materials should not degrade due to temperature extremes likely to be encountered in routine storage or transportation    materials which are known to cause skin irritation or are conducive to disease shall not be used for the parts which contact the skin  materials which support the growth of fungi or algae shall not be used  fabric lining or padding materials if used may be detachable for the purpose of washing so long as their absence does not degrade the protective capabilities of the helmet d  finish             all edges of the helmet shall be smoothed and rounded with no metallic parts or other rigid projections on the inside of the shell that might injure the wearers head in the event of impact e  retention system             the retention system shall be designed so as to discourage misuse  that is of all the ways in which the retention system might be used the design use shall be the simplest and quickest to implement  helmets shall not be fitted with nonessential features which if misused can degrade the performance  quick release buckles if used shall not be able to be released inadvertently             fabric chinstraps if used shall not be secured to the shell by a bolt pin or rivet passing through the fabric itself  although other alternatives may be proposed the preferred method of attachment is that the strap be looped through and sewn about a metal hanger which can then be secured to the shell by bolt rivet or other appropriate means f  peripheral vision             the helmet shall provide peripheral visual clearance as measured using a reference head form appropriate to the size of the helmet  this peripheral vision includes a horizontal clearance of at least º an upward clearance of at least º and a downward clearance of at least º  however this downward clearance makes specific allowance for breath deflectors  these clearances are described in terms of planes fixed in the reference head forms             some competitive applications may require helmets with more restricted visual fields  when justified special addenda to this standard will define reduced visual fields the procedures for determining whether a helmet satisfies the requirement and the additional labeling requirements warning that the headgear may be appropriate only for certain uses g  sizing             the requirements of this standard are such that most helmets will perform optimally only when tested within a range of head circumferences  outside this range helmets may still provide a measure of protection but they may not meet requirements for certification  the manufacturer must specify this entire range when helmets are submitted for certification  later when helmets are distributed for sale every helmet shall include a permanent label indicating the range of head circumferences for which it is intended                                                qualifications for certification             for qualification testing helmets shall be in the same condition as those offered for sale  no helmet or component which has been subjected to any tests described in this standard shall be offered for sale after testing  at least five  and as many as seven  complete helmets must be submitted by the manufacturer for a certification test program for each distinct structural configuration of the models offered for sale  all but one of these samples will be destroyed in testing the untested sample shall be retained for comparison and reference  if different fit pad configurations are planned in order to accommodate this head gear for different size ranges five of the samples submitted must be configured for the largest size range  if seven samples are considered necessary the remaining two samples must be configured for the smallest intended size  additional samples representing different fit pad configurations may also be provided at the discretion of the submitter                                                                      modifications             cosmetic changes to certified headgear are permissible  such changes are generally limited to marking or trimming the headgear with manufacturer approved paint or tape  otherwise modifications to certified headgear effectively create new configurations which shall not have the confidence and certification of the foundation until properly evaluated  manufacturers must not place the foundations certification label in any modified headgear without the foundation’s written authorization             the foundation recommends that helmet owners not modify or contract with someone else to modify their helmets  any structural modification may adversely affect a helmets protective capability  the foundation’s certification and quite likely all manufacturer warranties apply to the headgear only in its as manufactured condition                                                           random sample testing             in addition to the certification testing the foundation will routinely obtain and test samples of previously certified models  these samples will be selected from among those stocks intended for retail sale to consumers  in this manner the foundation will attempt to ensure that the helmets made available to the public continue to meet the performance requirements of this standard             for those cases in which helmets are provided directly to users and do not pass through a normal sales distribution system the foundation will set up alternative procedures to monitor certified products  specifically if helmets are provided directly to teams or individuals for use in events the foundation must have access to the helmets for spot checking and nondestructive evaluation                                                            labeling and marking             each helmet shall have durable visible and legible labeling identifying the manufacturer the month and year of manufacture the model and the size  labeling shall be uncoded and either in english or a language common to the area where the helmets are to be distributed  the headgear shall also be labeled to the following effect   the certification id this number consists of two alpha characters four numerics a hyphen and two more numerics indicating the year in which the certification was awarded this certification id is marked on the test reports cover letter and the certificate awarded to the helmet maker shortly after the helmet met requirements it identifies the tests and the archive samples on which the certification is based   no helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable impacts  however for maximum protection the helmet must be of good fit and the retention system must be securely fastened to retain the helmet  the helmet when fitted and fastened shall not be removed easily   this helmet is so constructed that the energy of an impact may be absorbed through its partial destruction though damage may not be visible  if it suffers an impact it must either be returned to the manufacturer for inspection or be destroyed and replaced   intended for head circumferences from xx cm through yy cm             if any of the helmet components are sensitive to common solvents adhesives paints or cleansers the helmet must also bear labels to the following effect this helmet can be seriously damaged by some common substances without visible damage  apply only the following  recommended cleaning agents paints adhesives and the like as appropriate              if the helmet model was certified according to a special addendum to this standard each helmet shall also include the warning labels required by that addendum             the certification id label requirement is intended to minimize confusion during standards enforcement  it may be waived at the discretion of the foundation if the manufacturer can demonstrate that existing brand and model labels will reasonably identify the unit sufficiently  any such waiver must be obtained in writing             each helmet shall also include one of the foundations serialized certification labels  the snell certification label shall be placed either inside or on the outside of the helmet as appropriate in such a way that it cannot be removed intact             the registered trademark certification label of the snell memorial foundation may be used by the manufacturer only under license from the snell memorial foundation  the specifics of licensure may be obtained from the foundation marking and labeling of critical components             if a helmet component may reasonably be replaced with an inappropriate substitute that might degrade wearer safety and performance in any of the tests called out in this standard the manufacturer must mark those components so that users may avoid the purchase and use of inappropriate replacement parts   in particular face shields on full face helmets must be marked to identify the manufacturer and the month and year of manufacture head forms             this standard invokes six standard head forms for helmet inspection marking and testing  the geometry of these head forms is according to the definitions for the ‘a’ ‘c’ ‘e’ ‘j’ ‘m’ and ‘o’ head forms described in international standards organization iso draft standard iso dis   the impact mass specifications for the impact test phase are comparable to those in ece  for these same head form designations             iso dis  includes descriptions for half head forms suitable for guided fall impact testing or for full head forms such as those used in the positional stability tests  figures  and  depict the general shapes of the half head form configuration  the following table lists useful dimensions from the two references given above table  useful head form parameters

fixed in the geometry of these head forms as shown in figure   this description of the extent of protection uses the iso definitions of the basic plane the longitudinal plane the transverse plane and the reference plane  other planes have also been defined strictly for convenience and clarity             the basic plane corresponds to the anatomical plane frankfort plane that includes the auditory meatuses and the inferior orbital rims  the reference plane is above and parallel to the basic plane the longitudinal or midsagittal plane is perpendicular to the basic plane and is the plane of symmetry dividing the right half of the head form from the left  the transverse or coronal plane is perpendicular to both the longitudinal and basic planes  it corresponds to the anatomical plane that contains the two auditory meatuses and divides the front from the rear portions of the head             these planes are all well known entities  several other planes however have proven useful  the s plane is parallel to the basic plane and lies above it at a distance determined by the size of the head form  the s plane is parallel to the s plane and the basic plane and lies between them  the s plane is also parallel to these planes and lies below the basic plane             figure  extent of protection     table  extent of protection head form designation parameters a b c d e iso a  mm  mm

the front two thirds  it is parallel to the transverse plane and lies at a given distance behind the point where the reference plane and longitudinal planes intersect with the front surface of the head form  the distance from this point hereafter called the reference point is determined by the size of the head form  the fore plane is also parallel to the transverse plane  it lies behind the reference point at a distance determined by the size of the head form   the extent of protection provided by the helmet must include the entire region above the s plane and forward of the fore plane the entire region above the s plane and between the fore and rear planes and the entire region above the s plane and behind the rear plane  figure  and the associated table lay out these additional defined features and show the extent of protection and the test line testing a  inspection             each helmet will be inspected for the required labels and for compliance with the general limitations made on structure  samples received for certification testing must incorporate all the critical component labels but other labeling is not necessary for evaluation  samples received for rst enforcement testing must have all the required labels             some helmets may incorporate innovations and other features not anticipated by this standard but which raise concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the headgear  these will be referred to members of the foundations board of directors for evaluation  any feature deemed to reduce the protective capacity of the headgear whether explicitly mentioned in this standard or not will be a cause for rejection b  head forms and helmet positioning             the determination of which head forms are appropriate to a helmet is based on the specified smallest and largest head circumferences for the helmet  for samples submitted for certification this specification must include the smallest and largest values of head circumference for every possible fit pad configuration of the helmet  for helmets received for rst testing the smallest and largest head circumferences will be taken directly from the helmet label if the smallest head circumference specified for the helmet is less than  cm the a head form is the smallest appropriate  otherwise the smallest appropriate head form for a particular helmet is the largest of the six head forms whose circumference is no greater than the manufacturer’s specified smallest circumference the largest appropriate head form is the largest of the six specified head forms whose circumference is no greater than the manufacturer’s specified largest circumference table  test head forms as determined by size specification     largest size specified

head form identified as appropriate the next smaller head form shall be considered the largest appropriate  if the samples are too small for even the smallest appropriate head form as indicated by the manufacture specification the samples shall be rejected for certification the table shows which head forms will be used in certification testing for various head size specifications  since the largest head size should never be smaller than the smallest head size most of the lower left region of the table is blank  if the size specification corresponds to one of the gray cells along the table’s main diagonal only a single test head form will be necessary and the manufacturer need only submit five samples identical samples configured with comfort padding for the largest intended head size for certification testing  otherwise two more samples are required identical to the first five in all respects except that the comfort padding must be configured for the smallest intended head size             during testing helmets will be positioned on the selected test head form according to the manufacturer’s specified helmet positioning indices  if the manufacturer fails to provide positioning information with certification samples the helmets will be positioned according to the best judgment of the authorized technical personnel  if the helmets meet certification requirements the helmet positioning indices will be those used in all future testing             these helmet positioning indices represent distances on the front of the head form from the basic plane along the intersection with the longitudinal plane upward to the lower brow edge of the helmet  helmet positioning indices will be assigned for all head form sizes appropriate to the headgear  each headgear could conceivably require as many as six helmet positioning indices one each for the ‘a’ ‘c’ ‘e’ ‘j’ ‘m’ and ‘o’ head forms c  marking             the helmet is placed upon the largest appropriate iso head form positioned according to the apposite helmet positioning index and held in place with an applied force of  newtons  lbs  the intersections of the shell with the various defined planes are then traced onto the outer surface of the helmet in the following manner             the level of the s plane is marked on that portion of the helmet in front of the fore plane  the level of the s plane is marked on that portion lying between the fore and rear planes  the level of the s plane is marked on that portion behind the rear plane  finally line segments along the fore plane are marked to join the s and s planes and similarly line segments along the rear plane are marked to join the s and s planes              these lines enclose the top of the helmet and are the boundary of the required extent of protection  however it shall not be a cause for rejection if parts of this boundary fall below the edge of the helmet  a test line shall be constructed within the extent of protection  mm from the closest point on the boundary as shown in figure              if identical helmets are to be configured with different thicknesses of comfort padding to accommodate different ranges of head size the required extent of protection marked on the test samples shall include the required extent of protection for each different configuration as marked on the largest head form appropriate for each  that is  the helmet must meet all the requirements of this standard in each of the intended configurations d  peripheral vision             the clearance for peripheral vision will be checked by placing the helmet on each appropriate iso head form positioning it according to the apposite helmet positioning index and holding it in place with a force of  newtons  the clearance must include the following solid angles to the front of the head form              the upward visual clearance              the lateral visual clearance              the downward visual clearance except for the breath deflector allowance             helmets certified to a special addendum to this standard and bearing the warning labels specified in the addendum will not be subjected to the following procedures and criteria for evaluating clearances for vision  however the procedures and criteria specified in the addendum will be applied instead             the upward visual clearance is the solid angle bounded by the reference plane of the head form and a second plane tilted º up from the reference plane  this second plane intersects the reference plane at two points on the front surface of the head form that are  mm to the right and left of the longitudinal plane as shown in figure   figure  lateral visual clearance             the lateral visual clearance as shown in figure  is the solid angle bounded by the reference plane the s plane and two more planes that are perpendicular to the reference plane and that contain the reference point on the front of the head form  one of these two planes forms an angle of º with the longitudinal plane and lies to the left of the head form  the other forms the same angle to the right of the head form              the downward visual clearance is the solid angle bounded by the basic plane of the head form and a second plane tilted º down from the basic plane that intersects it at two points on the front surface of the head form that are  mm to the right and left of the longitudinal plane as shown in figure   however intrusions into this downward clearance are permitted so long as the intrusions are within the breath deflector allowance             the breath deflector allowance is shown in figure   it includes the region that is within  mm to the right and left of the longitudinal plane and that lies below the two planes that form º angles with the longitudinal plane and that intersect it at the level of the s plane   e  performance testing             the performance testing subjects helmets to a dynamic test of retention system strength to a test for positional stability to impact management tests to helmet shell penetration tests to a removability test and to chin bar and face shield tests if appropriate  these tests are conducted upon helmet samples kept under laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or that have been conditioned in one of three environments simulating some of the conditions in which the helmet might reasonably be expected to be used             prior to conditioning and testing samples may be exposed to solvents common to motorsports which have been found to attack and degrade some helmet components             in certification testing four samples are required for testing on the largest appropriate head form  the first of these is kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity and allowed to come to equilibrium  it is subjected first to the positional stability test and then to the impact management and other tests  the second third and fourth samples are conditioned hot cold and wet and subjected to the dynamic test of the retention system the impact management test and the other tests  if the smallest appropriate head form is not the same as the largest two additional samples are required for testing on this head form  the first of these will be allowed to stabilize at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity and then will be subjected to the test for positional stability  this sample may then be conditioned hot or cold or kept at laboratory ambient for impact testing  the second additional sample shall be tested in impact conditioned hot cold or wet or kept at lab ambient according to the best judgment of the test personnel             the selection of tests conditioning and special conditioning is left to the discretion of the foundations technical personnel  however for certification testing each of the specified tests shall be applied to at least one sample  furthermore it is expected that all testing will be conducted so as to exercise all the likely failure modes of the helmet e  conditioning for testing             test samples may be kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or may be conditioned cold hot or wet according to the specifications given below  at the discretion of the foundations technical personnel and at any point during the testing a sample previously kept at ambient may be conditioned cold hot or wet  however once a sample has been conditioned cold hot or wet the sample must be maintained in that condition throughout the rest of the testing             the special solvent wipe conditioning described below may be applied to any sample at the discretion of the foundations technical personnel              a special conditioning  prior to any impact or retention system testing helmets may first be conditioned with a solvent mix of  toluene and  isooctane  a cotton cloth or suitable substitute shall be soaked in the solvent and used as an applicator  the solvent will be applied to the shell first in an area within  mm of the chin strap attachments for not less than five  seconds on each side and then applied to the remainder of the shell for not less than ten  seconds  at least thirty minutes shall elapse before further conditioning and testing             b cold  the sample shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of  ±º c for a period of not less than four  hours or more than twentyfour  hours             c heat  the sample shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of  ±º c for a period of not less than four  hours or more than twentyfour  hours             d wet  the sample shall be conditioned by being continuously sprayed with water at a temperature of  ±º c for a period of not less than four  hours or more than twentyfour  hours  this spray shall be directed at the helmets external surfaces  the helmet shall not be subjected to total immersion              all testing of these hot cold and wet helmets shall begin within two  minutes from the time of removal from the conditioning apparatus  the samples shall be returned to the conditioning apparatus between tests e  positional stability rolloff             the test for positional stability shall only be applied to samples kept at ambient laboratory temperature and humidity  the helmet shall not have been subjected to any prior performance testing             the helmet shall be tested on the smallest appropriate standard fullface head form  the head form shall be supported on a stand so that its vertical axis points downward at an angle of º to the direction of gravity  the head form shall be oriented face down  the helmet shall be placed on the head form and adjusted to obtain the best configuration of the retention system  an inelastic strap shall be hooked to the edge of the helmet at the rear centerline and brought forward so that its free end hangs downward across the top of the helmet  an inertial hammer shall be suspended from the free end of the strap  this inertial hammer shall enable a  kg ± g mass to be dropped through a  m guided fall in order to deliver an abrupt shock load to the headgear  the shock load will force the helmet to rotate forward on the head form  the helmet may be shifted but must remain on the head form              the head form shall be repositioned so that it is facing upward but with the vertical axis still oriented downward at º to gravity  the helmet shall be positioned and adjusted to obtain the best configuration of the retention system  the strapinertial hammer shall be hooked to the brow edge of the helmet at the center line so that the strap lies along the centerline and the hammer is suspended from the top of the helmet  the shock weight shall be dropped through the  m guided fall delivering an abrupt shock load forcing the helmet to rotate rearward  the helmet may be shifted but must remain on the head form             the entire portion of the inertial hammer assembly that participates in the loading of the helmet shall be such that its mass is no more than  kg including the  kg shock mass e  dynamic test of retention system             the dynamic test of the retention system may be applied to any sample either kept at ambient temperature and humidity or conditioned hot cold or wet  this test may be performed before after or between any of the other procedures in the test sequence  however the retention test shall not be valid if an integral chin bar has been removed from a full face helmet              the helmet shall be supported on its lower shell edge in such a manner that the chin strap may be fastened under a device whose upper end approximates the contour of the bony structure of the jaw  the device will then be given a mechanical preload followed by a dynamic loading  the retention system fails if it cannot support the mechanical loads or if the maximum deflection during the dynamic load exceeds  mm  the retention system also fails if it cannot be easily and quickly unfastened after testing             if the technician determines that the helmet cannot be adequately supported on its lower shell edge at his discretion he may support the helmet on a head form for this test             a this chinstrap loading device shall consist of a simulated jaw and accommodations for the preload and dynamic load  the jaw portion shall consist of two metal bars or rollers each one  ± mm in diameter separated by  ± mm on center  the mass of this device shall not exceed  kg             b   a preload shall be applied for at least  seconds this preload shall consist of the mass of the chin strap loading device static load of  kg and the shock load of  kg ± g which will total  kg ± g             c  raise the  kg ± g mass which will then be dropped in a vertical guided fall through a distance of  mm to load the retaining system abruptly the shock load of  kg mass and static load of  kg mass shall not be additive in order to protect the test mechanism the impact of the  kg mass may be cushioned with a  durometer rubber pad  mm in diameter by ½ mm thick or its equivalent e  impact management tests             the impact management tests may be performed on samples kept at ambient temperature and humidity or conditioned hot cold or wet  the sample shall not have been subjected to the shell penetration test beforehand             these tests involve a series of controlled impacts in which the helmet is positioned on a test head form  the helmeted head form is then dropped in guided falls onto specified test anvils  the impact site and the impact energy must meet certain requirements in order for the tests to be valid             if the sample is so constructed that it interferes with the test equipment preventing impacts at sites within the test line then at the discretion of the foundations technical personnel parts of the helmet may be cut away to facilitate testing  every reasonable effort to minimize such cutting will be made  however there shall be no relaxation of the impact levels or of the test criteria             certain tests shall not be valid when performed on samples that have been cut for impact testing the dynamic strength of retention system test of section e the positional stability test of section e the chin bar test of section e and the removability test of section e             special considerations apply when the helmet is a “flipup” model that is configured with a chin bar that pivots up and away from the face of the wearer  for the first three impacts on any flipup sample the impact tests will be performed with the chin bar locked in the closed position  in these tests the chin bar must not release and “flipup” inadvertently in certification testing the tests will be structured so as to investigate performance in frontal followed by lateral impact    e    impact management test equipment             the test equipment shall consist of at least the following items             a the smallest and largest of the head forms appropriate for the helmet sample  this head form shall be of rigid low resonance metal such as magnesium alloy and shall conform to the a c e j m or o geometries specified in iso dis ‑             b a ball‑armcollar assembly which is fitted to a socket machined into the base of the head form  the ballsocket configuration shall be such that the geometrical center of the ball is located on the central vertical axis of the head form  mm above the reference plane as described in iso dis   the ballarmcollar assembly shall also include a uniaxial accelerometer fixed firmly into the ball             c a head form support assembly rigidly attached to the ballarm  this support assembly shall be such that it and consequently the head form may be guided in a vertical drop  the mass of this support assembly shall not exceed  kg  the total mass of the head form plus ballarmcollar assembly plus head form support assembly shall be within  grams of  kg for the iso a head form  kg for the iso c head form  kg for the iso e head form  kg for the iso j head form  kg for the iso m head form and  kg for the iso o head form             d a guidance system such that the head formsupport assembly is guided in a vertical drop onto a test anvil  this guidance system may consist of two or more wires or one or more rails  the head formsupport  guidance system  test anvil alignment shall be such that             d  the drop trajectory shall be a straight line within º of vertical and within º of the sensitive axis of the uniaxial accelerometer             d  the line parallel to the drop trajectory and passing through the center of the head form ballsocket shall pass within  mm of the center of the test anvil within  mm of the center of gravity of the head formsupport assembly and within  mm of the sensitive element of the uniaxial accelerometer              e a rigid anvil mount consisting of a solid mass of at least  kg  the upper surface of the anvil mount shall consist of a steel plate with a minimum thickness of  mm and a minimum surface area of  m             f three test anvils flat hemispherical and edge              f  the flat anvil shall have a minimum surface area of  m eg  mm diameter face  when fixed in position on the anvil mount the surface shall be perpendicular to the head form trajectory             f  the hemispherical anvil shall have a  ± mm radius              f  the edge anvil shall have a striking face  mm wide with a depth of at least  mm  the radius of the edges on the impact face shall not exceed  mm  when in position the striking face shall be perpendicular to the head form trajectory   the anvil shall be sufficiently long that the ends do not contact the helmet during impact              g a uniaxial accelerometer  the acceleration data channel must comply with sae recommended practice j  requirements for channel class  with the exception that the frequency response need not include the range from dc to  hz which may not be obtainable using certain types of transducers             h a velocity measurement device which will yield the velocity of the head formsupport assembly within the last  mm of travel before impact  the velocity measurement must be accurate to within ±  e    test definitions             a the impact site refers to the portion of the helmet struck during an impact test  it is defined as the point where a line passing through the center of the head form ball and the center of the anvil intersects the outer surface of the helmet at the instant the helmet first touches the anvil             b the impact velocity is the velocity of the head formsupport assembly as measured within no more than  cm of the first contact between the helmet and the impact surface             c   this standard specifies nominal impact velocities which must be adjusted in order to allow for deviations between the actual mass of the test head form assembly and the specified ideal value  the actual test impact velocity shall be the specified nominal velocity multiplied by the square root of the value obtained by dividing the ideal head form assembly mass by the actual mass  for example if for the ‘a’ head form the mass of the head form plus ballarmcollar and support assembly as in paragraph ec masses  kg instead of the ideal mass of  kg the test impact velocities shall be obtained by multiplying the nominal velocities by a factor of              d there are two levels of test the first is the standard level used to identify those helmets which definitely meet this standard  it is applied to samples submitted for certification testing and to those acquired for the foundation’s random sample test rst program  the second is the deviation level which is applied to samples acquired for second round rst procedures that is testing of samples of currently certified models for which previous samples have obtained failing results in rst testing   failure to meet test criteria at the deviation levels indicates that the sample definitely does not meet the requirements of the standard   e test impacts             test impact sites shall be on or above the test line  rivets vents and any other helmet feature within this region shall be valid test sites  each impact site will be subjected to a group of one or two impacts according to the anvil selected for that site             the impact site for the first impact within in a group is the target for the successive impacts in the same group  however if an impact group is sited closer than  mm to any previous impact group that later impact shall be declared invalid             there is no restriction regarding test anvil selection  the impact velocities for each test impact depend on the type of test and on the head form designation  second impacts do not apply to helmets in tests against the edge anvil             the technician may select either the largest or smallest appropriate head form for any particular group of impacts  in all cases the technician may impact any site on the helmet surface on or within the test lines as drawn for any of the head forms considered appropriate for that helmet             the nominal impact velocities are listed in the following table table  nominal impact

hemispherical anvil shall be tested according to the values in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly             c each site tested against the edge anvil shall be tested according to the values in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly  no helmet shall be subjected to the second impact for this anvil             d if the impact velocity for any test impact exceeds the specified mass adjusted velocity by more than  that impact shall be declared invalid             please note the impacts described above are based on specific velocities and not prescribed drop heights  to attain the proper velocity for an impact it is likely that the drop height will need to be adjusted to compensate for frictions inherent in most mechanical helmet testing systems height adjustments for these frictions should not account for more than  of the total drop height  also the  margin allowed for impact velocity reflects the uncertainties expected even for well maintained drop equipment  it is expected that drop heights will always be selected to produce as closely as possible the precise impact velocity as called out in the standards and adjusted for head form assembly drop mass   e    impact test interpretation table  peak acceleration criteria   head form a c e j m o all testing  g  g  g  g  g  g               the peak acceleration of the head form shall not exceed the values in the table above depending on the head form  the helmet’s protective structures shall not break apart throughout the testing  if the foundations technical personnel conclude that fracture of the helmet shell impact liner retention system or other components could reasonably imply an undue laceration hazard either from the impact surface or from the helmet itself the sample shall be considered to have failed             a flipup configuration helmet sample tested with the chin bar closure locked at the outset of any of the first three impacts performed upon it in testing and which “flipsup” inadvertently as a result of a valid test will also be deemed to have failed  in most cases each helmet must not “flipup” as a result of two impacts applied to the first site tested and the first of the two impacts at the second site             if in certification testing a sample is found to meet all the test criteria but any two of the impacts were at less than  of the specified impact velocity as adjusted for drop assembly mass the testing for that sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated  similarly if there are two instances where an impact falls beyond  mm from the first impacts in its group the testing for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated  finally if an invalid impact produces a peak acceleration exceeding the test criterion the testing for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated             the impact test procedures leave considerable latitude to the helmet tester regarding site and anvil selection  it is expected that the tester will orchestrate each standard test series in order to investigate potential weaknesses and to exercise each likely failure mode and will conduct deviation level testing to exercise the failure modes identified previously             if at the end of a certification test series the foundations technical personnel conclude that the results obtained in valid impacts are not sufficient to determine whether the helmet model meets the performance requirements of this standard additional samples may be conditioned and tested  it is expected that all samples submitted will meet all the test requirements e  chin bar test             the chin bar test applies to full face helmets only  at least one helmet in each certification series shall be tested  the helmet shall be firmly mounted on a rigid base so that the chin bar faces up and the reference plane is at  ±º from horizontal  a mass of  ±  kg with a flat striking face of  m minimum area shall be dropped in a guided fall so as to strike the central portion of the chin bar with an impact velocity of  ± msec  the maximum downward deflection of the chin bar must not exceed  mm nor shall any component fail so as to cause a potential injury to the wearer e  shell penetration test             the shell penetration test may be applied to helmets kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or helmets conditioned hot cold or wet at least one helmet sample shall be tested in shell penetration  the complete helmet shall be placed on a rigidly mounted head form  the test head form for the penetration test need not be the standard iso head form shape used in the impact testing and helmet marking  it is expected only that the device used will provide reasonable support for the helmet and conformance with the interior of the helmet immediately beneath the site of the penetration test  if the helmet contains a sling or some other adjustable sizing component it shall be relaxed to its most extendable position             the penetration test striker shall have a mass of  kg ± g and the point of the striker shall be a cone with an included angle of º ±º and an altitude of  ± mm  the striking tip shall have a hardness of  rockwell scale c ±  points and a radius of  ±  mm  the region of the support head form directly beneath the striker tip shall be wax or soft plastic so and covered with a thin telltale of paper foil tape or some similar material             the striker shall be dropped to strike the surface of the helmet shell at a velocity of  ±  meters per second as measured when the striker is no more than  centimeters away from contact with the helmet the helmet may be oriented on the support head form so that the test striker is directed at any site on or above the test line but the penetration test site must be at least  cm removed from the center of any impact test site or any other penetration test site  at the test technician’s discretion samples may be tested at more than one site on the shell             for all penetration tests performed the test striker must not penetrate through the helmet wall so as to put a hole in the telltale between the helmet and the support head form e  face shield penetration test             if a face shield is provided with a full face helmet this face shield shall be tested for penetration resistance in the following manner             the face shield shall be tested on the appropriate helmet correctly deployed across the facial opening and under laboratory ambient conditions  a soft lead pellet weighing  ± g with a diameter of  ± mm and traveling at a velocity of  ± km per hour shall strike the face shield normal to the surface  the face shield shall be tested in at least three different locations  the center line and  ± mm to either side of the center line  the pellet must not penetrate to the interior of the helmet e  removability             the helmet removability test determines whether the helmet can be removed from an unconscious victim without resorting to any buckles clasps or other mechanisms which may be rendered nonfunctional by impact stresses  the helmet is placed on the largest appropriate complete iso head form with all the closures and retention systems engaged  a technician must remove the helmet from the head form using simple common hand tools but without accessing any of the helmet mechanisms             the hand tools for this test are limited to shears simple edged tools and flat bladed screw drivers  the operation must not require more than thirty seconds e  posttesting disassembly and inspection             if a set of helmets is submitted for and passes certification testing at least one of the tested samples shall be disassembled and inspected  if the laboratory staff identifies any internal feature that is not plausible for inclusion in a production helmet the model shall be rejected  if an internal projection on the helmet shell is deemed to present an undue laceration or puncture hazard the model shall be rejected  in evaluating these internal projections no allowance shall be made for liner thickness             at the discretion of the technician any helmet may be disassembled in order to check for internal projections

be interested in this standard     auto racing imposes risks of death or permanent impairment due to head injury     the proper use of protective helmets can minimize the risk of death or permanent impairment�     the protective capacity of a helmet is difficult to estimate particularly at the time of purchase or use�� protective capability is currently measured by destructive testing which is beyond the means of most helmet wearers     snell certification backed by ongoing destructive testing samples taken randomly from dealers and distributors identifies those helmet models providing and maintaining the highest levels of head protection six of the most critical elements affecting a helmets protective properties are     impact management  how well the helmet protects against collisions with large objects     helmet positional stability  whether the helmet will be in place on the head when its needed     retention system strength  whether the chin straps are sufficiently strong to hold the helmet throughout a head impact     extent of protection  the area of the head protected by the helmet     flame resistance  whether the helmet will withstand exposure to direct flame this flame resistance may well mean survival for well belted drivers and passengers in a crashed vehicle where a few seconds of additional time may enable escape or rescue     frontal head restraints � whether the helmet is appropriate for use with tether systems intended to divert the inertial load of the wearer�s head and helmet away from the cervical spine in crash impact conditions ����������� this standard describes simple tests for all of these items� however the tests for the second item helmet stability of necessity presume that the helmet is well matched to the wearers head and that it has been carefully adjusted to obtain the best fit possible� unless you take similar care in the selection and fitting of your own helmet you may not obtain the level of protection that current headgear can provide ����������� the foundation recommends the simple straightforward procedure recommended to consumers by most helmet manufacturers ����������� position the helmet on your head so that it sits low on your forehead if you cant see the edge of the brim at the extreme upper range of your vision the helmet is probably out of place� adjust the retention system so that when in use it will hold the helmet firmly in place� this positioning and adjusting should be repeated to obtain the very best result possible� the procedure initially may be time consuming� take the time ����������� try to remove the helmet without undoing the retention system closures� if the helmet comes off or shifts over your eyes readjust and try again� if no adjustment seems to work this helmet is not for you try another ����������� this procedure is also the basis of the test for helmet stability described in this standard� this test performs the same steps but uses standard head forms� however you must still perform this procedure for yourself when buying a helmet and every time you wear a helmet� only in this way will you be able to make all the proper adjustments to get the best fit possible� furthermore your test on your own head will be an improvement on ours you will determine whether the helmet is appropriate for you personally ����������� there are several other important aspects of helmets to consider� full face helmets provide a measure of protection from facial injuries� the external shell of these helmets includes a rigid chin guard that passes from left to right over the lower part of the face� the foundation has devised special tests for the chin bars of full face helmets ����������� there are two varieties of full face helmets the chin guard may be an integral immovable part of the helmet but in socalled �modular� or �flipup� helmets the chin guard may be hinged so that when released it will pivot or flip up and out of the way for the rider�s convenience modular helmets must meet all the same requirements as those equipped with integral chin bars with the additional requirement that the chin guard release mechanism must be sufficiently secure to prevent inadvertent opening in a crash impact� ����������� some helmets come with a separate structure which bolts to the helmet and which is intended to cover the lower part of the face� these removable chin bars are often intended to deflect small stones and debris encountered in some motor sports and may not be effective facial protection in falls and accidents� the foundation does not test removable chin bars and considers any headgear equipped with them to be an open face helmet ����������� if a full face helmet is equipped with a face shield it may also provide a measure of eye protection� the foundation tests the face shields of full face helmets for particle penetration resistance� face shields provided with open face helmets generally do not provide the same levels of eye protection and for that reason are not considered ����������� the shells of both open and full face helmets should also provide a measure of protection from penetration� the foundation tests the shells of both full and open face helmets for penetration resistance ����������� effective headgear must be removable� paramedics and other emergency personnel must be able to quickly remove headgear from accident victims in order to check for vital signs and to perform emergency procedures� the foundation has devised tests and criteria for helmet removability ����������� the foundation tests helmets for visual field� the helmet must provide a minimum range of vision as measured on standard head forms� however the range of vision you obtain may vary considerably from our measurement ����������� it is also important to remember that the visual field requirements are based on the needs of people participating in well regulated and controlled events� for this reason the requirements are considerably less than those the foundation requires for street use headgear such as for motorcycle helmets� be absolutely certain that the helmet and face shield permit you adequate vision for every intended use� specifically if your automotive racing helmet is only sufficient for controlled track events dont use it for street motorcycling ����������� there are several important factors which the foundation does not consider directly but which bear on the effectiveness of protective helmets� be certain your helmet is wearable that is that its comfortable and adequately ventilated when worn for prolonged periods� few people will wear an uncomfortable helmet� a helmet that is not worn wont protect anyone foreword ����������� in a racing accident drivers and passengers may suffer injury or death� helmets on the market today offer varying degrees of protection but the consumer has little basis for judging the relative effectiveness of a given model� this standard presents rational methods for identifying those helmet models which definitely meet specified standards for impact crash protection and retention system strength and afterwards identifying� those which definitely have ceased to meet those standards ����������� the snell foundation urges that protective helmets be required for all individuals participating in supervised racing events and encourages the general public to wear helmets which meet appropriate performance standards ����������� this  standard establishes performance characteristics particularly suited to the conditions of automotive racing which may include complete harness and restraint systems elaborate roll cages and reduced visual field requirements� this standard does not establish construction and material specifications� the foundation does not recommend specific materials or designs� manufacturers voluntarily submit helmets to be tested to this standard and if the submitted helmets pass a certification is issued ����������� the foundation will make available the identity of those products which have been snell certified but will not attempt to rank those products according to performance nor to any other criteria� neither does the foundation distinguish between the needs of participants in competitive events and those of the general public ����������� all of the requirements described herein including both initial certification and random sample testing are an integral part of this standard� no helmet can satisfy the standard unless it is subject to both certification and random sample testing by the foundation ����������� snell certification for protective headgear requires a specific contractual agreement between the primary headgear manufacturer and the foundation� certification procedures may be obtained upon application to the foundation ����������� snell memorial foundation is a registered certification mark and sa is a certification mark of the snell memorial foundation introduction ����������� this standard addresses the problem of protecting the head from direct impact with surfaces or objects that might be encountered in a racing accident� the standard prescribes direct measures of several factors bearing on a helmets ability to protect the head as well as its general serviceability as automotive racing headgear� thus this standard is directed towards the kinds of performance bearing on head protection that may not readily be discernable by even knowledgeable consumers at the time of purchase ����������� some of these performance requirements have been expressed in terms of limitations on the various components and features of the single general helmet configuration currently available� these expressions have been used only for the sake of clarity and should not be misinterpreted as requiring specific configurations or materials� as newer helmet technologies appear these limitations will be reexamined and perhaps restated ����������� a racing helmet consists generally of a rigid head covering and a retention system composed of flexible straps and hardware� the rigid covering consists of a strong stiff outer shell and a crushable liner� the stiff outer shell protects by its capacity to spread a concentrated load at its outer surface over a larger area of the liner and the wearers head� the crushable liner protects the head from direct impact by its capacity to manage impact energy� �since there is no certain way to anticipate the severity of a head impact or whether the impact surface will be such that it will spread the load over the helmet or concentrate it at a single point the most generally effective helmet will combine the strongest stiffest possible outer shell with a liner chosen to limit the peak deceleration of the wearer�s head to within tolerable limits ����������� full face helmets including �modular� or �flipup� helmets provide a measure of facial protection in addition to the impact protection generally sought� the principle feature of these is a chin bar that extends forward to cover the jaw area converting the facial opening into a visual port� frequently a face shield is also provided so that the wearers face is completely covered ����������� in traditional full face helmets the chin bar is an integral immovable part of the helmet structure� in �modular� or �flipup� full face configurations the chin bar may be released to pivot about a hinge up and away from the face� the security of the chin bar closure is of special concern most of the tests prescribed in this standard will be conducted with the chin bar closed and secured failure of the chin bar closure will generally be a cause for rejection ����������� although other helmets may be configured to allow the use of �bolton� chin bar elements these helmets are not considered to be full face and are treated instead as open face configurations����� ����������� the retention system holds the headgear in position throughout normal usage and especially during falls and accidents ensuring that the helmet will be in place to manage a direct impact� this standard applies two different tests to the retention system� the first of these tests for stability by fitting the headgear to a standard head form and then attempting to displace it by applying tangential shock loadings� the second tests retention system strength by applying a shock load to the system components through a simulated chin ����������� the quality of the fit and the care taken with the adjustments are absolutely critical elements in these tests� the manufacturer must provide suitable guidance so that the wearer will be able to select and adjust headgear to obtain the necessary quality of fit and positional stability ����������� the capacity for impact protection is determined by direct measurement of the shock delivered through the helmet to a head form when the helmeted head form is dropped in a specified manner onto any of three unyielding anvils� a fourth anvil is used to test impact protection for repeated strikes against a roll cage assembly� in addition to meeting all other test criteria the chin bar closure on flip up helmet configurations must remain securely engaged for the first three impact tests conducted on any helmet sample ����������� most racing helmets are intended to accommodate a range of head sizes and shapes� various thicknesses of resilient padding are sometimes placed within otherwise identical helmets during production or during fitting to configure the helmet to several different ranges of head size� this resilient padding does not significantly affect the way the helmet absorbs and attenuates impact and is not directly addressed in this standard ����������� the helmet must also resist penetration by sharp edged and pointed projections and projectiles� this capacity is tested by placing the helmet on a head form and dropping a metal cone of specified mass and geometry onto the shell� the tip of this cone must not penetrate to the head form ����������� similarly the helmets must resist chemical attack by bodily fluids as well as solvents and chemicals associated with motorsports� this capacity may be tested by applying a solvent mix before further conditioning and testing ����������� since auto racing drivers are frequently unable to escape quickly from accident involved vehicles their helmets must also provide a measure of protection against fire� exposed helmet components whether internal or external must be flame resistant� they must not be combustible and when exposed to high temperatures must self extinguish when the heat load is removed� ����������� helmet components are tested separately for flame resistance by exposing them to a direct propane flame of a specified temperature for specified time periods� when the flame is withdrawn each of these components must self extinguish within a specified time limit� furthermore when the helmet shell is tested the temperature of the padding or lining materials within the helmet that would presumably touch the wearers head must not exceed �c ����������� the chin strap must also be flame resistant� the chin strap will be tested similarly to other helmet components� it must not melt and must self extinguish within the allowed time ����������� for full face helmets this standard tests the rigidity of the chin bar by dropping a weight onto it at a specified velocity so as to attempt to force the chin bar toward the interior of the helmet� the chin bar must not deflect more than a specified amount and if the helmet is a flipup configuration the chinbar must remain securely closed ����������� if a face shield is provided with a full face helmet then this face shield must resist penetration by small particles� a sharp lead pellet of a specified weight is directed into the face shield at a specified velocity� the pellet must not penetrate into the helmet interior ����������� this face shield must also withstand a flame resistance test� as with other components the face shield must be self extinguishing within an allotted time� furthermore the face shield must not melt down allowing the flame to reach the interior of the helmet� also this face shield must have a positive hold down� since inadvertent displacement of the face shield during racing could have disastrous consequences the only way to remove or raise the face shield from its normal operating position must involve the deliberate disengagement of some catch mechanism� friction mechanisms will not satisfy this requirement ����������� auto racing helmets must also include accommodations for frontal head restraints� these consist of a metal inserts in the helmet shell which will allow the attachment of tether mounts appropriate to one of several available frontal head restraint systems� requirements for these inserts are described in fia  frontal head restraints� helmet owners who select and install their own tether mount hardware must take care to use only appropriate equipment� the inserts are metric and may be permanently damaged by nonmetric hardware � ����������� this standard also includes a test intended to determine whether the headgear may be removed from an unconscious accident victim quickly easily and reliably in spite of any damage the headgear might reasonably be expected to sustain� traditional helmet architectures have satisfied this requirement so readily that many standards including previous snell foundation standards have not mentioned it� even so it is unthinkable that a headgear might protect its wearer in an accident only to thwart attempts at rescue afterward ����������� inadequate ventilation may render a helmet unwearable in hot climates especially if the helmet is full faced� but this standard makes no direct demands on either the quantity or quality of air flow to the wearer ����������� other general features of racing helmets may include eyeshades and accommodations for goggles and visibility enhancements such as bright colors and reflective surfaces� these features all deal with matters of safety and comfort that are not directly addressed in this standard but which merit the consideration of wearers as well as manufacturers ����������� �although helmet use has been shown to reduce the risk of head injuries significantly there are limits to a helmets protective capability� no helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable accidents� therefore injury may occur in accidents which exceed the protective capability of any helmet including even those helmets meeting the requirements of this standard ����������� a helmets protective capability may be exhausted protecting the wearer in an accident� helmets are constructed so that the energy of a blow is managed by the helmet causing its partial destruction� the damage may not be readily apparent and the foundation strongly recommends that a helmet involved in an accident be returned to the manufacturer for complete inspection� if it is not possible to do so the helmet should always be destroyed and replaced ����������� finally the protective capability may diminish over time� some helmets are made of materials which deteriorate with age and therefore have a limited life span� at the present time the foundation recommends that motor sports helmets be replaced after five  years or less if the manufacturer so recommends construction a� general ����������� the assembled helmet shall have smooth external and internal surfaces� any feature projecting more than  mm beyond the outer surface must readily break away all other projections on the outer surface shall be smoothly faired and offer minimal frictional resistance to tangential impact forces� rivets and similar projections into the helmet interior must offer no laceration or puncture hazard� restraint clips may be used at the rear or on the side of the helmet� the helmet shall provide as nearly uniform impact protection over the entire protected area as is possible ����������� if the absence of any detachable component of the helmet does not prevent its being worn then this absence must not compromise either the retention system or the impact protection� if any part of the helmet detaches during testing it must offer no laceration or puncture hazard nor reduce the coverage of the head ����������� if the manufacturer provides addons such as visors face shields and neck curtains with the helmet these addons must not lessen the protective capability of the basic helmet nor reduce the visual field below standard requirements nor create a direct hazard for the wearer b� shell ����������� if rivets are used the heads shall not have sharp edges and shall not project more than  mm from the outer surface of the helmet c� ventilation ����������� ventilation inlets and outlets may be used provided they are made of flexible materials such as rubber or vinyl plastic� ports and fittings for forced air ventilation must comply with all the general requirements on helmet features� when connected to the forced air sources these ports and fittings must not limit the range of motion of the head and must not interfere with a quick escape from the vehicle d� materials ����������� ideally materials used in the manufacture of the helmet should be of durable quality and not be harmed by exposure to sun rain dust vibration sweat or products applied to the skin or hair� similarly the materials should not degrade due to temperature extremes likely to be encountered in routine storage or transportation ��������� materials which are known to cause skin irritation or are conducive to disease shall not be used for the parts which contact the skin� materials which support the growth of fungi or algae shall not be used� fabric lining or padding materials if used may be detachable for the purpose of washing so long as their absence does not degrade the protective capabilities of the helmet e� finish ����������� all edges of the helmet shall be smoothed and rounded with no rigid projections on the inside of the shell that might injure the wearers head in the event of impact f� retention system ����������� the retention system shall be designed so as to discourage misuse� that is of all the ways in which the retention system might be used the design use shall be the simplest and quickest to implement� helmets shall not be fitted with nonessential features which if misused can degrade the performance� quick release buckles if used shall not be able to be released inadvertently ����������� fabric chinstraps if used shall not be secured to the shell by a bolt pin or rivet passing through the fabric itself� although other alternatives may be proposed the preferred method of attachment is that the strap be looped through and sewn about a metal hanger which can then be secured to the shell by bolt rivet or other appropriate means g� peripheral vision ����������� the helmet shall provide peripheral visual clearance as measured using a reference head form appropriate to the size of the helmet� this peripheral vision includes a horizontal clearance of at least � an upward clearance of at least � and a downward clearance of at least �� however this downward clearance makes specific allowance for breath deflectors� these clearances are described in terms of planes fixed in the reference head forms ����������� some competitive applications may require helmets with more restricted visual fields� when justified special addenda to this standard will define reduced visual fields the procedures for determining whether a helmet satisfies the requirement and the additional labeling requirements warning that the headgear may be appropriate only for certain uses h� sizing ����������� the requirements of this standard are such that most helmets will perform optimally only when tested within a range of head circumferences� outside this range helmets may still provide a measure of protection but they may not meet requirements for certification� the manufacturer must specify this entire range when helmets are submitted for certification �later when helmets are distributed for sale every helmet shall include a permanent label indicating the range of head circumferences for which it is intended� qualifications for certification ����������� for qualification testing helmets shall be in the same condition as those offered for sale� no helmet or component which has been subjected to any tests described in this standard shall be

of the models offered for sale� all but one of these samples will be destroyed in testing the untested sample shall be retained for comparison and reference� ����������� if different fit pad configurations are planned in order to accommodate this head gear for different size ranges six of the samples submitted must be configured for the largest size range� the remaining samples may be configured for the smallest intended size� additional samples representing other fit pad configurations may also be provided at the discretion of the submitter� modifications ����������� cosmetic changes to certified headgear are permissible� such changes are generally limited to marking or trimming the headgear with manufacturer approved paint or tape� otherwise modifications to certified headgear effectively create new configurations which shall not have the confidence and certification of the foundation until properly evaluated� manufacturers must not place the foundations certification label in any modified headgear without the foundation�s written authorization ����������� the foundation recommends that helmet owners not modify or contract with someone else to modify their helmets� any structural modification may adversely affect a helmets protective capability� the foundation�s certification and quite likely all manufacturer warranties apply to the headgear only in its as manufactured condition� random sample testing ����������� in addition to the certification testing the foundation will routinely obtain and test samples of previously certified models� these samples will be selected from among those stocks intended for retail sale to consumers� in this manner the foundation will attempt to ensure that the helmets made available to the public continue to meet the performance requirements of this standard ����������� for those cases in which helmets are provided directly to users and do not pass through a normal sales distribution system the foundation will set up alternative procedures to monitor certified products� specifically if helmets are provided directly to teams or individuals for use in events the foundation must have access to the helmets

dc to  hz which may not be obtainable using certain types of transducers ����������� h a velocity measurement device which will yield the velocity of the head formsupport assembly within the last  mm of travel before impact� the velocity measurement must be accurate to within �� e��� test definitions ����������� a the impact site refers to the portion of the helmet struck during an impact test� it is defined as the point where a line passing through the center of the head form ball and the center of the anvil intersects the outer surface of the helmet at the instant the helmet first touches the anvil� please note this point need not be the point at which the helmet shell makes first contact with the anvil ����������� b the impact velocity is the velocity of the head formsupport assembly as measured within no more than  cm of the first contact between the helmet and the impact surface ����������� c�� this standard specifies nominal impact velocities which must be adjusted in order to allow for deviations between the actual mass of the test head form assembly and the specified ideal value� the actual test impact velocity shall be the specified nominal velocity multiplied by the square root of the value obtained by dividing the ideal head form assembly mass by the actual mass� for example if for the �a� head form the mass of the head form plus ballarmcollar and support assembly as in paragraph ec masses  kg instead of the ideal mass of  kg the test impact velocities shall be obtained by multiplying the nominal velocities by a factor of  ����������� d there are two levels of test the first is the standard level used to identify those helmets which definitely meet this standard� it is applied to samples submitted for certification testing and to those acquired for the foundation�s random sample test rst program� the second is the deviation level which is applied to samples acquired for second round rst procedures that is testing of samples of currently certified models for which previous samples have obtained failing results in rst testing�� failure to meet test criteria at the deviation levels indicates that the sample definitely does not meet the

a helmet�s capabilities in severe impact �low velocity� which is intended to assess capability in moderate impacts and �low lateral� which is intended to assess capability in strikes against the sides of a vehicle interior e standard test impacts ����������� samples maintained in any of the specified conditions may be tested test impact sites shall be on or above the test line� rivets vents and any other helmet feature within this region shall be valid test sites� each impact site will be subjected to a group of one two or three impacts according to the anvil selected for that site ����������� the impact site for the first impact within in a group is the target for the successive impacts in the same group� however if an impact group is sited closer than indicated in the following table to any previous impact group that later impact group shall be declared invalid table  impact group separation a  c head forms e  j head forms m  o head forms at least  mm at least  mm at least  mm   ����������� there is no restriction regarding test anvil selection� the impact velocities for each test impact depend on the type of test and on the head form designation� second impacts do not apply to helmets in tests against the edge anvil third impacts apply only to helmets in tests against the roll bar anvil ����������� the technician may select either the largest or smallest appropriate head form for any particular group of impacts� in all cases the technician may impact any site on the helmet surface on or within the test lines as drawn for any of the head forms considered appropriate for that helmet ����������� a flat anvil each site tested against the flat anvil shall be tested in two impacts according to the st and nd values specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly� no site shall be subject to the third impact for this anvil ����������� b hemispherical anvil each site tested against the hemispherical anvil shall be tested in two impacts according to the st and nd values specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly� no site shall be subject to the third impact for this anvil

assembly� no site shall be subjected to the second or third impact for this anvil ����������� d each site tested against the roll bar anvil shall be tested in three impacts according to the st nd and rd values specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly ����������� e if the impact velocity for any test impact exceeds the specified mass adjusted velocity by more than  that impact shall be declared invalid ����������� please note the impacts described above are based on specific velocities and not prescribed drop heights� to attain the proper velocity for an impact it is likely that the drop height will need to be adjusted to compensate for frictions inherent in most mechanical helmet testing systems height adjustments for these frictions should not account for more than  of the total drop height� also the  margin allowed for impact velocity reflects the uncertainties expected even for well maintained drop equipment� it is expected that drop heights will always be selected to produce as closely as possible the precise impact velocity as called out in the standards and adjusted for head form assembly drop mass e low velocity test impacts ����������� a single helmet sample maintained at laboratory ambient conditions shall be tested on the smallest appropriate head form in five separate single impacts against the flat anvil at the according to the low velocity figure specified in table  impacts may be sited anywhere on or above the test line but no two impacts may be sited any closer to each other than the separation distance specified in table  e low lateral impact ����������� the low lateral impact tests may be performed only on samples maintained for the appropriate time period in laboratory ambient condition� the helmet sample may be tested on guided fall equipment including an appropriate halfhead form and a correctly aligned uniaxial accelerometer or on free drop equipment using an appropriate full head form and a triaxial accelerometer the test technician will select the test equipment according to his judgment as to which most favors the helmet being tested the impact surface for this test shall be the kerbstone anvil described in e ����������� the helmet and head form assembly shall be dropped in such a manner that just prior to contact �        the head form has no perceptible rotational velocity �        the head form�s longitudinal plane is within � of horizontal �        the head form�s transverse plane shall be within � of perpendicular to the kerbstone anvil�s striking edge �        a vertical erected from the center of the anvil passes within  mm of a point marked on the helmet�s surface at the intersection of the head form transverse and reference planes ����������� the nominal impact velocity for this test is specified in the nominal impact velocity table this value must be adjusted to account for any difference between the ideal mass of the head form and the measured mass� the impact velocity shall be measured within the last four centimeters of travel before contact with the anvil� ����������� the separation between this impact site and previous or subsequent impact sites on the same sample must be maintained according to the impact group separation table� e��� impact test interpretation table  peak acceleration criteria head form   a c e j m o st nd rd and low

type of test� the average of the five peak accelerations for any sample subjected to the low velocity impact shall not exceed  g the helmet�s protective structures shall not break apart throughout the testing� if the foundations technical personnel conclude that fracture of the helmet shell impact liner retention system or other components could reasonably imply an undue laceration hazard either from the impact surface or from the helmet itself the sample shall be considered to have failed� a flipup configuration tested with the chin bar closure locked at the outset of one of the first three valid impacts performed on the sample and which releases inadvertently as a result of the impact will also be deemed to have failed ����������� if in certification testing a sample is found to meet all the test criteria but any two of the impacts were at less than  of the specified impact velocity as adjusted for drop assembly mass the testing for that sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated� similarly if there are two instances where an impact falls beyond  mm from the first impacts in its group the testing for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated� finally if an invalid impact produces a peak acceleration exceeding the test criterion the testing for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated ����������� the impact test procedures leave considerable latitude to the helmet tester regarding site and anvil selection� it is expected that the tester will orchestrate each standard test series in order to investigate potential weaknesses and to exercise each likely failure mode and will conduct deviation level testing to exercise the failure modes identified previously ����������� if at the end of a certification test series the foundations technical personnel conclude that the results obtained in valid impacts are not sufficient to determine whether the helmet model meets the performance requirements of this standard additional samples may be conditioned and tested� it is expected that all samples submitted will meet all the test requirements e����� chin bar test ����������� the chin bar test applies to full face helmets only� at least one helmet in each certification series shall be tested� the helmet shall be firmly mounted on a rigid base so that the chin bar faces up and the reference plane is at  �� from horizontal �a mass of  �  kg with a flat striking face of  m minimum area shall be dropped in a guided fall so as to strike the central portion of the chin bar with an impact velocity of  � msec� the maximum downward deflection of the chin bar must not exceed  mm nor shall any component fail so as to cause a potential injury to the wearer e����� shell penetration test ����������� the shell penetration test may be applied to helmets kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or helmets conditioned hot cold or wet at least one helmet sample shall be tested in shell penetration� the complete helmet shall be placed on a rigidly mounted head form� the test head form for the penetration test need not be the standard iso head form shape used in the impact testing and helmet marking� it is expected only that the device used will provide reasonable support for the helmet and conformance with the interior of the helmet immediately beneath the site of the penetration test� if the helmet contains a sling or some other adjustable sizing component it shall be relaxed to its most extendable position ����������� the penetration test striker shall have a mass of  kg � g and the point of the striker shall be a cone with an included angle of � �� and an altitude of  � mm� the striking tip shall have a hardness of  rockwell scale c �  points and a radius of  �  mm� the region of the support head form directly beneath the striker tip shall be wax or soft plastic and covered with a thin telltale of paper foil tape or some similar material ����������� the striker shall be dropped to strike the surface of the helmet shell at a velocity of  �  meters per second as measured within no more than  centimeters of contact with the helmet the helmet may be oriented on the support head form so that the test striker is directed at any site on or above the test line but the penetration test site must be at least  cm removed from the center of any impact test site or any other penetration test site� at the test technician�s discretion samples may be tested at more than one site on the shell ����������� for all penetration tests performed the test striker must not penetrate through the helmet wall so as to mark the telltale between the helmet and the support head form e����� face shield penetration test ����������� if a face shield is provided with a full face helmet this face shield shall be tested for penetration resistance in the following manner ����������� the face shield shall be tested on the appropriate helmet correctly deployed across the facial opening and under laboratory ambient conditions� a soft lead pellet weighing  � g with a diameter of  � mm and traveling at a velocity of  � km per hour shall strike the face shield normal to the surface� the face shield shall be tested in at least three different locations� the center line and  � mm to either side of the center line� the pellet must not penetrate to the interior of the helmet

the thermal load of a propane flame at the flame location representing a measured temperature of � ��c ����������� a shell� the site selected on the shell for this test must lie at least  mm from any site tested in impact or shell penetration and from any cutting done to facilitate impact testing� the flame shall impinge upon the external surface of the helmet shell for a period of  seconds� simultaneous with the removal of the flame a timing device shall be activated� the helmet shall be selfextinguishing within  seconds of the removal of the flame ie shall not continue to burn with the emission of a flame� the helmet will not be subjected to impact tests after testing for flammability ����������� the temperature of the padding and lining materials normally in contact at any point with the wearers head shall not exceed �c during the test ����������� b trim� the helmet trim will include any attachment sold for use with the product not otherwise discussed in this section on flame

selfextinguishing within  seconds of the removal of the thermal load ����������� c chin strap� the chin strap utilized will be subjected to the same propane flame utilized in the shell test� the chin strap and chin strap cover if provided shall be suspended between two clips at least  mm apart so that there is only minimal tension and so that the broad side of the strap is perpendicular� the flame shall be applied to the cover if present or otherwise to the strap for a period of  seconds� the chin strap and if present the cover shall not melt and shall be selfextinguishing within  seconds of the removal of the thermal load ����������� d face shield for full face helmets equipped with face shields only� the face shield will be subjected to the same propane flame utilized in the shell test

e��� removability ����������� this test shall be applied to helmet models configured with systems other than traditional dring chin strap retention systems it is intended to determine whether the helmet can reasonably be removed from an unconscious victim without resorting to any buckles clasps or other mechanisms which may be rendered nonfunctional by impact damage� the helmet is placed on the largest appropriate complete iso head form with all the closures and retention systems engaged� a technician must remove the helmet from the head form using simple common hand tools either to cut or circumvent helmet retention elements without accessing any of the helmet mechanisms ����������� the hand tools for this test are limited to shears simple edged tools and common screw drivers� the operation must not require more than thirty seconds e��� posttesting disassembly and inspection ����������� at the discretion of the technician any helmet may be disassembled in order to check for internal projections plausibility or for deviations from the originally certified configuration certification series test plan ����������� for a certification test series it is expected that each test

�pete� snell died of massive head injuries received during an automotive racing accident his friends and associates formed the snell memorial foundation the goals of the foundation were to investigate and understand the mechanisms of head injury and to encourage the development of truly protective helmets for use in automotive sports ����� the snell memorial foundation is a notfor profit organization incorporated under the laws of the state of california  it exists solely for the purpose of engaging in scientific and educational activities promoting the safety wellbeing and comfort of persons engaged in any type of travel or vehicular transportation ����� today the snell memorial foundation tests various kinds of helmets and certifies them for use in prescribed activities it currently publishes standards for automotive racing helmets karting helmets motorcycle helmets bicycle helmets nonmotorized or multisport helmets harness racing and equestrian sports helmets and skiing and snowboarding helmets the foundation is interested in just about every kind of headgear worn to protect against crash impact injury ����� helmet manufacturers submit their products for certification if their helmets pass the demanding series of performance tests and therefore meet the referenced standard the manufacturers are invited to enter a contract with the snell memorial foundation which entitles them to use the snell memorial foundation name and logo in their packaging and advertising and to purchase certification decals from the foundation for use in their certified products however this contract also requires the certified manufacturers to maintain their high standards for all of their certified production and to participate in the random sample test program in this program the foundation acquires and tests helmets to certify the continuing quality of the products the foundation takes pains to see that these random sample helmets are drawn from the same supply as those sold in stores thus the foundation is able to monitor the quality of the helmets sold directly to the consumer ����� participation in the snell certification program is strictly voluntary manufacturers are not obliged to seek certification or to continue it but while a manufacturer does participate the foundation demands full compliance similarly the foundation prosecutes all unauthorized use of the snell name and logo to the full extent of the law ����� the snell memorial foundation maintains a state of the art testing facility in north highlands california there is a board of directors who oversees the activities of the foundation and a salaried staff who conducts the testing and performs the administrative functions   the snell memorial foundation inc  madison avenue suite  north highlands california  tel   fax   email infosmforg web address httpwwwsmforg ���� the foundation has also published standards for headgear used in bicycling nonmotorized sports

generatedmore than their share of analysis and published works in my gettysburg civil war scholar and twentysixyear gettysburg resident mark snell goes beyond the campaign itself to explore the culture of the battlefield in this fascinating collection snell provides an intriguing interpretation of some neglected military aspects of the battle such as a revisionist study of judson kilpatricks decision to launch farnsworths charge on the southern end of the confederate line after picketts charge and the role of union logisticians in the northern victory in addition he looks at a town east of gettysburgyork pennsylvania a community that likewise suffered invasion in the summer of as well as at the role of union and confederate soldiers from the new state of west virginia who fought against each other during the campaign further this collection assesses gettysburgs evolution as a historic place an american shrine an inspiration for popular music a training ground for soldiers past and present a mecca for reenactors a combat zone between commercial developers and preservationists and a home to its residentsincluding the author who gives us a personal view of what the battlefield and its surrounding community have come to mean to him a retired army officer and an established authority on the civil war and military history snell amply demonstrates in this
