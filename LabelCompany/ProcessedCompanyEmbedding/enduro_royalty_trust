royalty trust is a good investment  enduro royalty trust nysendro  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»enduro royalty trust is a good investmentnov  about enduro royalty ndro tom dorsey research analyst dividend investing reits master limited partnershipsinvestment dailymy question for the day is is enduro royalty trust nyse ndro a worthy investment first the background to uncover the facts the enduro royalty trust makes its money by pumping oil and natural gas out of the ground and selling it the two factors that determine the profitability of the trust is the amount it can pump out and the price it gets enduro resource partners llc the parent company estimated in the prospectus when they created enduro royalty trust in  they had  mboe of oil and  mmcf of natural gas in the holdings as of december   the underlying properties had proved reserves of  million barrels of oil equivalent the number of wells will continue to rise over the next few years and production numbers will increase as the earlier wells begin to reduce their production over the years the follow on wells will produce the top producing years are expected to be from  through  the lack of clarity into the future to estimate longevity of production and account for any new developments in the extraction process that could increase the amount of oil and gas extracted over time is unknown but there will be a drop in production as the reserves are pumped out the price for the oil and gas are determined by the market and there is no method to measure what futures prices will be one unique effect during the current year of  is the fact that there has not been a hurricane that has threatened the us and forced the closure of pumping wells or the refineries due to this fact there is a surplus of oil and gas products on the market that is depressing prices at this time the market today has wti at  and brent at  natural gas opened at  and is up over a dollar in wednesdays trading with the depressed prices the revenue will be down and distribution will be lower during the q  enduro royalty trust is characterized as a perpetual trust a perpetual trust has the benefit of no limits on production and no end date this puts investors of enduro royalty trust in a position to profit for the long term however enduro has stated in their prospectus that the trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following  the approval of the holders of at least  of the outstanding trust units and sells the net profits interest  the annual cash available for distribution to the trust is less than  million for each of any two consecutive years  the holders of at least  of the outstanding trust units vote in favor of dissolution or  the trust is judicially dissolved so although enduro is classified a perpetual trust there is definitely the potential for an end to the trust on november   enduro resource partners llc conveyed to the trust through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of enduro with the trust the net profits interest in exchange for  units of beneficial interest in the trust the trust units immediately following the conveyance enduro completed an initial public offering of  trust units after the completion of the initial public offering and as of september   and december   enduro owned  trust units or  of the issued and outstanding trust units on october   enduro completed a secondary offering of  trust units at a price of  per unit to the public after the completion of the secondary offering enduro now owns  trust units or  of the issued and outstanding trust units the trust used the proceeds from the  million units to reduce their debt to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility this sale did not affect the total number of units and will not affect the distribution to unit holders enduro resource partners llc was the largest hold of units and now investors own  of the trust there is no controlling interest but the total of all investors do not reach  required for action to terminate the trust the sale was more beneficial to the company to pay off debt for the long term quality of the trust and the unit holders the cost of the debt would have been at a higher cost later and the company now allows more unit holders to reap the profits of the trust the q  financial statement reports  million in oil sales and  million in natural gas sales for a total of  million in total sales minus operating expenses of  million leaves plus  million for contract settlements leaves  million net profit  distribution is  million for  million unit holders provides about  per unit per month this is sustainable now for the math  is enduro a good investment with a stock price of  during trading hours on november   and the estimated dividend  per month  per year that is a yield of  the current price is depressed so lower revenues could be seen for q  as prices rebound and average out over the next  years the return should be strong and continue the double digit return the stock price should not drop soon project over the next  years while production remains high but over time with the reserves diminishing we expect to see the value decrease there is opportunity for undiscovered reserves from the wells to increase the value and length of time the wells can pump time is also a positive for developments and new techniques to recover more oil from wells one additional advantage with enduro royalty trust there is no production limit or end date and if the trust is terminated the unit holders will likely be eligible to receive compensation for the remaining assets my assessment is enduro royalty trust is a good investment that will provide a doubledigit returns over the next  years without a significant drop in original principle investing in this trust the investor must carefully track the remaining reserves and decide if and when is the appropriate time for them to enter or
