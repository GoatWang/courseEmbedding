media  address working capital deficiencies and  augment our leadership team with proven sales and marketing strategists refocus on a directtoconsumer model first we are creating a marketing and sales

proved insufficient to reach our sales and revenue goals without substantial and sustained digital brand and marketing campaigns we are unlikely to meet our sales and revenue goals derek duhame the new president of pura naturals commented moving forward pura will be more aligned with and dedicated to relevant and impactful marketing and sales strategies the changes that have taken place over the last two quarters and those planned for this quarter involve tactics and strategies to engage consumers build brand awareness increase sales and profitability and improve financial performance for our investors we have reevaluated our distribution channels while examining and preparing for a more effective and efficient strategic model to grow sales and increase shareholder value following this strategy we will integrate a direct to consumer model into our existing distribution channels that will incorporate digital marketing and media to promote our products directly to the customers most likely to buy them to this end we have separated and defined our products by product line for better market segmentation in addition we are rebranding several products in our home and health  beauty lines to highlight the specific benefits they provide furthermore to build our brand we have engaged several strategic marketing partners with proven expertise in creating brand awareness product positioning and consumer engagement strategies and tactics we think the foregoing strategies will increase overall sales build our brand awareness increase our profit margins and earnings per share

initiatives will increase our brand awareness profitability and sales revenues working capital third to address our working capital needs as we implement the foregoing strategies we have identified

aligned to meet the demands of todays connected consumer lake forest california – may   at pura naturals inc we have listened to our investors and are making several changes to improve financial performance and position the pura brand among the leading competitors in our industry over the first two quarters of this year we have taken steps to  refocus to a directtoconsumer model  significantly transition our marketing and branding efforts to digital media  address working capital deficiencies and  augment our leadership team with proven sales and marketing strategists refocus on a directtoconsumer model first we are creating a marketing and sales distribution model that fits the modern connected consumer in the past we thought simply acquiring shelf space at several high volume retail stores would sell our products however this strategy has proved insufficient to reach our sales and revenue goals without substantial and sustained digital brand and marketing campaigns we are unlikely to meet our sales and revenue goals derek duhame the new president of pura naturals commented moving forward pura will be more aligned with and dedicated to relevant and impactful marketing and sales strategies the changes that have taken place over the last two quarters and those planned for this quarter involve tactics and strategies to engage consumers build brand awareness increase sales and profitability and improve financial performance for our investors we have reevaluated our distribution channels while examining and preparing for a more effective and efficient strategic model to grow sales and increase shareholder value following this strategy we will integrate a direct to consumer model into our existing distribution channels that will incorporate digital marketing and media to promote our products directly to the customers most likely to buy them to this end we have separated and defined our products by product line for better market segmentation in addition we are rebranding several products in our home and health  beauty lines to highlight the specific benefits they provide furthermore to build our brand we have engaged several strategic marketing partners with proven expertise in creating brand awareness product positioning and consumer engagement strategies and tactics we think the foregoing strategies will increase overall sales build our brand awareness increase our profit margins and earnings per share ecommerce and digital marketing second following our new focus on the directtoconsumer model we have launched or will be launching three new websites that enable consumers to directly purchase our innovative and ecofriendly products online on april  we launched a new ecommerce website for our popular pura marine products during recent tradeshows our pura marine products generated significant interest in both the recreational watercraft and the industrial oil transportation industries we were pleased to receive several new commercial orders for our marine products following the tradeshows and website launch following this model we plan to launch two more ecommerce sites in june we will market and sell our newlyrebranded pura clean total home cleaning products through the new pura clean club ecommerce website and sell our health  beauty products through puracleanse club our puracleanse club website will introduce two brand new resultsfocused products the new puracleanse in body bars and puracleanse in facial system all of our new ecommerce sites will incorporate modern digital and social media marketing strategies including facebook advertising campaigns we believe these bold initiatives will increase our brand awareness profitability and sales revenues working capital third to address our working capital needs as we implement the foregoing strategies we have identified several potential significant sources of capital and funding partners we believe that access to more capital will assist us to implement the ecommerce model and increase revenues through targeted digital media marketing campaigns management team finally we have restructured our management team adding executive talent that we believe will help us meet our sales and profitability goals during the first quarter  we hired derek duhame an experienced executive with a proven record of generating product

substantial decrease from the previous reporting period the balance sheet submitted for the same period records  thousand in assets with  thousand in accounts receivable liabilities are a bit more than  thousand with this current ratio of  and cash on hand of  thousand the company has a liquidity problem additionally the balance sheet does not show any inventory values this is puzzling if pura
