social media brewery info beers guild memberships andy hazen is a workhorse of a brewer from start to finish he is a oneman operation the former cabinetmaker is also a selfreliant mainer through and through he was originally an allgrain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers he designed the barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together hazen notes that when you live in maine you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive for him brewing is the service he provides to his local community located in the rolling hills of lincolnville maine andrews is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to hazens home finding the brewery is more than half the battle have no fear however as everyone knows about andrews also be aware that due to some thieving souls the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public the only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in hazens front yard and hazen hasnt been quick to replace the sign either while he welcomes visitors you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer like many other unsung small brewers running his oobarrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for hazen watching hazen run the brewery is a little like watching willy

beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people beer is sold in bottles and cans it may also be available on draught particularly in pubs and bars the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries the strength of beer is usually around  to  alcohol by volume abv although it may vary between  and  with some breweries creating examples of  abv and above beer forms part of the culture of beerdrinking nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards in canada the canadian government’s food and drug regulations states that beer should have alcohol content

museum san jose california beer is one of the worlds oldest prepared beverages possibly dating back to the early neolithic or  bccitation needed when cereal was first farmed and is recorded in the written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries as of  more than  billion litres  billion gallons the equivalent of a cube  metres on a side of beer are sold per

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

microbreweries exists in the german region of franconia especially in the district of upper franconia which has about  breweries the benedictine weihenstephan brewery in bavaria germany can trace its roots to the year  as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery the brewery was licensed by the city of freising in  and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the uk in  australia followed suit in  and the us in  though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production varieties main article beer style cask ale hand pumps with pump clips detailing the beers and their breweries while there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer served unchilled—either cool or at room temperature—reveal more of their flavours cask marque a nonprofit uk beer organisation has set a temperature standard range of °– °c °– °f for cask ales to be served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the

it is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly rather than beer consumption a  study however found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly but with most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

museum san jose california beer is one of the worlds oldest prepared beverages possibly dating back to the early neolithic or  bccitation needed when cereal was first farmed and is recorded in the written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran some of the earliest sumerian writings contain references to beer examples include a prayer to the goddess ninkasi known as the hymn to ninkasi which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people and the ancient advice fill your belly day and night make merry to gilgamesh recorded in the epic of gilgamesh by the alewife siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries as of  more than  billion litres  billion gallons the equivalent of a cube  metres on a side of beer are sold per

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

microbreweries exists in the german region of franconia especially in the district of upper franconia which has about  breweries the benedictine weihenstephan brewery in bavaria germany can trace its roots to the year  as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery the brewery was licensed by the city of freising in  and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the uk in  australia followed suit in  and the us in

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout

or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

museum san jose california beer is one of the worlds oldest prepared beverages possibly dating back to the early neolithic or  bccitation needed when cereal was first farmed and is recorded in the written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

microbreweries exists in the german region of franconia especially in the district of upper franconia which has about  breweries the benedictine weihenstephan brewery in bavaria germany can trace its roots to the year  as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery the brewery was licensed by the city of freising in  and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the uk in  australia followed suit in  and the us in

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer

served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a beers presentation the rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel tilt of the glass and position of the pour in the centre or down the side into the glass all influence the end result such as the size and longevity of the head lacing the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk and the release of carbonation a beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pubs that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel health effects shortterm effects main

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer

served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a beers presentation the rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel tilt of the glass and position of the pour in the centre or down the side into the glass all influence the end result such as the size and longevity of the head lacing the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk and the release of carbonation a beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pubs that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel health effects shortterm effects main article shortterm effects of alcohol beer contains ethyl alcohol the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such beer consumption has shortterm psychological and

it is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly rather than beer consumption a  study however found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly but with most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer

served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a beers presentation the rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel tilt of the glass and position of the pour in the centre or down the side into the glass all influence the end result such as the size and longevity of the head lacing the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk and the release of carbonation a beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pubs that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel health effects shortterm effects main article shortterm effects of alcohol beer contains ethyl alcohol the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such beer consumption has shortterm psychological and

it is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly rather than beer consumption a  study however found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly but with most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer

served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a beers presentation the rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel tilt of the glass and position of the pour in the centre or down the side into the glass all influence the end result such as the size and longevity of the head lacing the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk and the release of carbonation a beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pubs that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel health effects shortterm effects main article shortterm effects of alcohol beer contains ethyl alcohol the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such beer consumption has shortterm psychological and

it is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly rather than beer consumption a  study however found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly but with most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index

switzerland  beer is the worlds oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink it is the third most popular drink overall after water and tea the production of beer is called brewing which involves the fermentation of sugars mainly derived from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley although wheat maize corn and rice are widely used most beer is flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect although this is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few

written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations approximately  years ago workers in the city of uruk modern day iraq were paid by their employers in beer during the building of the great pyramids in giza egypt each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids construction the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa – bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran

siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in  in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in  bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around  bc unlike sake mould was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as  bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around  by a carolingian abbot and again in  by abbess hildegard of bingen in  william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barleymalt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results as of  the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies

premium draught beers compared with  per cent in france and germany brewing main article brewing the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in  followed by australia in  and the us in  allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around  to  hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill the canadian government’s food and drug regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink the end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer water beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzeň region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients malted barley – a primary mash ingredient the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume glutencontaining grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from  ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance grains of paradise or alehoof combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative hop extract hop extract means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent the hop extract should not contain more than  per cent of the solvent used the solvent listed on canada’s food and drug regulations website are hexane methanol or methylenedisambiguation needed furthermore carbon dioxide or ethyl alcohol should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice preisomerized hop extract means an extract derived from hops by one of hexane carbon dioxide or ethanol for solvent and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces pastorianus brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa carrageenan from the seaweed kappaphycus cottonii polyclar artificial and gelatin if a beer is marked suitable for vegans it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents other additives in south korea

there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions—germany belgium england and the czech republic—have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his  book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in  topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between  and  °c  and  °f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops etymology the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealoþ in turn from protogermanic alu plural aluþ ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base h₂elut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english bēor from protogermanic beuzą probably from protoindoeuropean bʰeusóm originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvíssmál says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in  for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in  to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as  the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of  to  although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching  abv and higher wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness lager is cool fermented beer pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at – °c – °f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at – °c – °f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in – with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically – weeks measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel – a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke coke was first used for roasting malt in  but it was not until around  that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in  in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around  the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement § by strength beer ranges from less than  alcohol by volume abv to around  abv though this strength can be increased to around  by repitching with champagne yeast and to  abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of – with a typical abv of  the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around  abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content – that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above  by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content the weakest beers are dealcoholized beers which typically have less than  alcohol also called near beer and light beers which usually have  alcohol the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter  a  abv  degrees plato hence vetter  doppelbock was listed in the  guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hürlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at  abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached  abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to  abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a  abv beer in september  the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at  they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbräus  schorschbock  with  it was preceded by the end of history a  belgian ale made by brewdog in  the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a  abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a  abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbräus schorschbock a  abv eisbock and hair of the dogs dave a  abv barley wine made in  used the same fractional freezing method a  abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a dutch brewery in july  serving draught main articles draught beer keg beer and cask ale a selection of cask beers draught beer from a pressurised keg using a leverstyle dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in traditional pubs the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beers logo and trademark in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head similar to beer served from a nitrogen system the words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget or which are coldfiltered rather than pasteurised caskconditioned ales or cask ales are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers these beers are termed real ale by the camra organisation typically when a cask arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between – °c or – °f before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now uppermost the act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment so it must be left for a suitable period to drop clear again as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days at this point the beer is ready to sell either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump or simply being gravityfed directly into the glass draught beers environmental impact can be  lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences a life cycle study of one beer brand including grain production brewing bottling distribution and waste management shows that the co emissions from a pack of microbrew beer is about  kilograms  pounds the loss of natural habitat potential from the pack of microbrew beer is estimated to be  square metres  square feet downstream emissions from distribution retail storage and disposal of waste can be over  of a bottled microbrew beers co emissions where legal the use of a refillable jug reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar rather than buying prebottled beer can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption packaging main articles beer bottle and beverage can assortment of beer bottles most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans however bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast it is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle however some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast this practice is customary with wheat beers typically when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer  of the contents are poured and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass alternatively the bottle may be inverted prior to opening glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers many beers are sold in cans though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries in sweden in   of beer was sold in cans people either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass a technology developed by crown holdings for the  fifa world cup is the full aperture can so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process turning the can into a drinking cup cans protect the beer from light thereby preventing skunked beer and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer then became commonly associated with less expensive massproduced beers even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles plastic pet bottles are used by some breweries temperature the temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinkers experience warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled a low or mediumstrength pale ale to be served cool while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature beer writer michael jackson proposed a fivelevel scale for serving temperatures well chilled  °c or  °f for light beers pale lagers chilled  °c or  °f for berliner weisse and other wheat beers lightly chilled  °c or  °f for all dark lagers altbier and german wheat beers cellar temperature  °c or  °f for regular british ale stout and most belgian specialities and room temperature  °c or  °f for strong dark ales especially trappist beer and barley wine drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the s was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager chilling beer makes it more refreshing though below  °c the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below  °c  °f beer

served vessels main article beer glassware pilsner glass from brauerei schloss eggenberg beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels such as a glass a beer stein a mug a pewter tankard a beer bottle or a can or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs from a plastic cup the shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion as this increases sales of their product the pouring process has an influence on a beers presentation the rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel tilt of the glass and position of the pour in the centre or down the side into the glass all influence the end result such as the size and longevity of the head lacing the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk and the release of carbonation a beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pubs that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel health effects shortterm effects main article shortterm effects of alcohol beer contains ethyl alcohol the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such beer consumption has shortterm psychological and

it is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly rather than beer consumption a  study however found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly but with most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index
