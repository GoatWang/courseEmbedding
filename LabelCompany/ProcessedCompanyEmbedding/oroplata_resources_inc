hits the otc by alex carlson posted on june   share tweet share share email comments oroplata resources inc otcbborrp has hit the otc with a bang the company was long dormant until it announced early this month that it was acquiring a lithium property and craig alford was joining the company as ceo penny stock investors know that lithium remains one of the hottest sectors on the otc markets and explains the strong interest in shares of orrp investors are now asking how much higher can shares of orrp run on june  orrp announced that it  entered into a binding purchase agreement to acquire the western nevada basin project in southwest nevada the western nevada basin project covers the south central portion of an area that was first identified as lithium rich by the united states geological survey the project includes  mining claims covering approximately  acres the company also has an option to acquire another  mining claims approximately  acres oroplata will acquire a  interest in the project and the vendors of the project will retain a royalty equal to  of the gross value of mineral products recovered from commercial production which may be reduced to  with a single payment of  at any time prior to production at the same time as acquiring the western nevada basin project orrp appointed craig alford to the position of ceo and a director of the company he holds both a bachelor of science hons a master of science in geology and is a registered professional geoscientist pgeo in ontario and a qualified person as defined in national instrument  he said “i am delighted to be joining oroplata at this very exciting and important point in the company’s history this is a company to watch the demand for lithium has only just begun to grow and oroplata has put together some exceptional lithium projects in the southwest us including the western nevada basin project” orrp has chosen to focus on lithium brine and this is a smart move lithium brine projects have a number of significant advantages over conventional hard rock lithium mining projects they are cheaper to explore compared to the alternatives they are quicker in proving up a resource and reserves they are faster and much less capital intensive to put into production lithium brine production also has a much smaller environmental footprint and produces readytoship lithium carbonate prices for lithium carbonate are up  from the average price in  in the first quarter of this year and numerous sources have reported the potential growth in demand for lithium to be very robust the nevadabased tesla gigafactory expected to open on july th  will produce advanced lithium batteries for tesla elon musk has stated that tesla will need to consume the entire lithium market to meet its demands of  model ’s by  chinese demand of lithium has been another factor behind the surge of the lithium market which is driven by the country’s desire for electric cars and buses in a report from goldman sachs called “what if i told you” goldman refers to lithium as the “new gasoline” this is due to increasing demand for electric vehicles the cause is that the lithium market could triple from the current demand of mt to mt by  just  ev penetration into the market increases demand by mt a year in addition to craig alford becoming ceo orrp also added william bill hunter as director of finance and gregory kuzma to the board of directors and vp of exploration ceo craig alford said “oroplata is already off to an exciting start with the acquisition of some potentially very valuable lithium brine projects in nevada now we expect the appointment of two highly qualified professionals to our team will be a tremendous further boost to the company greg and bill are very experienced and knowledgeable and both have great track records in the mining sector we expect they will be a great addition and help support oroplata’s continued growth strategy” currently trading with a market cap of  million orrp is certainly one name to keep an eye on the company now has a seasoned mining team behind it centered around lithium which is perhaps the hottest mining sector to be in right now we

register news ​oroplata resources inc has one of the most favorable risk profiles in the inherently risky junior lithium space samuel rae follow  thursday  july   est electric vehicle ev maker tesla motors inc nasdaqtsla is in the news for all the wrong reasons right now as questions surrounding the safety of its vehicles and specifically their autopilot feature dominates the media the company may be taking some heat but theres one thing we can say for sure – the situation will pass sentiment fluctuates and when it reverses tesla will get back to doing what it does best – spearheading the ev revolution the ev space going to dominate personal travel within the next two decades likely sooner and companies like tesla are almost certain to benefit from the shift it and others are sparking as far as potential exposures go tesla is of course a direct option there are a few alternative exposures available however exposures rooted in the wider ev industry one that is just getting started is oroplata resources inc otcmktsorrp oroplata is a lithium explorer based in nevada the company is currently in the process of surveying salt flats for lithium brine – something that well get to in a little more detail shortly before that however why lithium lithium is the core component for the batteries that power electric vehicles lithium ion batteries are lightweight rechargeable and high energy density making them ideal for ev powering theres already a large market for lithium ion batteries – they are the power source of choice in most cell phones and other personal electronic items in turn theres already a pretty healthy market for lithium its nothing however compared to what it will be if ev demand increases in line with analyst forecasts analysts expect global lithium demand to rise  annually through  reaching just short of  metric tons annually teslas gigafactory the nevada plant at which the company intends to build its evs will account for  of these tons from the start of  this increase in demand can only have one impact on the per ton price of lithium carbonate the raw material used in the batteries and thats an increase back in  lithium carbonate went for around  a ton the price is currently closer to  and thats based on the limited penetration evs have had to date as price rises the incentive to mine and process lithium rises as does in turn the value of the resources owned by the mining companies so that answers the question as to why lithium is an attractive space right now why oroplata first its important to note that there are some inherent risks associated with allocating capital to this end of the lithium market the companies involved have plenty of upside potential sure but they are similar in risk profile to a gold or silver junior companies like oroplata don’t produce at this stage and theres no guarantee that they will reach the production stage near term all we can do is look at the facts and form an opinion based on what we know sometimes of course this opinion might be wrong but if its not the reward on offer can be enough to outweigh the risk of fact misinterpretation the facts underpinning oroplata are what make the company attractive and the reward seems to outweigh the risk at the companys current price with this in mind lets look at the facts as mentioned above the companys primary real estate is in nevada – the state widely considered as the epicenter of lithium mining in the us nevada is where the current lead producers mine and process lithium carbonate and its also where tesla is building its gigafactory its primary resource is the western nevada basin project a circa acre property that houses more than  mining claims and has the option to tack on a further  acres and  more mining claims if it wishes to going forward the property is lithium brine which is one of two primary types of mineral extraction associated with the space the lithium is located just beneath arid salt flats in a brine like fluid miners pump the brine fluid into what are called evaporation pools and leave it for a set period over the period and as the name of the pools suggests the liquid in the pools partly evaporates and leaves a thick lithium rich fluid companies then add sodium carbonate to the liquid which precipitates lithium carbonate oroplata just reported an updated resource estimate on its project based on examination of a large geochemical dataset derived from a united states geological survey usgs study of the region the estimate suggested lithium present with an economic grade of between  ppm and  ppm in the companys core project focus region to put this in context the clayton valley project which is currently the largest producing piece of real estate in the us processes lithium that has a grade of between  ppm and ppm in other words a large portion of the tested region holds lithium of economic grade equal to or better than comparable regions in a currently producing zone so the lithium is there and a usgs survey has confirmed its of a high enough economic grade to warrant extraction ad processing what about the team that will oversee this process oroplatas leadership is strong and is one of the attributes that set it apart from some of the other players in the space ceo is craig alford a geoscientist and qualified person as as defined in national instrument  with more than  years of experience in mining projects hes worked with and for bin names in china russia and the us and prior to his taking the position at oroplatas helm played a pivotal role in the zijin mining group investment in mining giant barrick gold corporation usa nyseabx – a deal worth  million at its close the company just announced the appointment of paul pelosi jr to its advisory board pelosi is an advisor to the nasa ames research center founded the cisco systems connected urban development team under the direction of cisco systems inc nasdaqcsco ceo john chambers and is the son of the former us speaker of the house nancy pelosi to sum things up lithium is set to be one of the tightest global markets in terms of supply for the next five decades a number of companies are breaking into the space and the nature of exploratory resource mining means most are high risk allocations some are also potentially high reward however and based on its resource study real estate location and management team oroplata has one of the most favorable risk to reward ratios on offerphoto by famartin disclosure the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of
