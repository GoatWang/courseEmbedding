join nowgo»omnicell mediocre financials best in class productsapr  about omnicell inc omcl joseph carey smallcap growth longshort equitylinkedinsummaryonly endtoend medical automation equipment and systemsthe company experiences  historical growth in revenuegrowing industry expected cagr around  per annum until omnicell nasdaqomcl is currently a very underestimated stock in terms of longterm growth potential the company is currently not bestinclass in terms of fundamentals but its expansion strategy is while fundamentals are meeting industry averages omnicells growth strategy includes horizontal integration to capture more market share this is a proprietary strategy in medical adherence automation the healthcare automation industry currently has high competition but omnicell has the capability of rising to the top this is because of recent acquisitions in the  fiscal year both ateb and aesynt were acquired giving omnicell the absolute competitive advantage of providing the only complete medication automation system on the market by combining all aspects together under a single system healthcare facilities can reduce costs and improve efficiency omnicell offers systems that assist with tasks such as making medications to dispensing them with different operations that can adapt to meet customers needs whether it be at a hospital or for inhome care part of omnicells product structure includes systems for its equipment this is where omnicells competitive advantage really shines the systems would integrate each working piece of the automation process to allow smooth and accurate transitions between machines as well as unparalleled inventory management other systems on the market need to be integrated into current systems which requires training and significant implementation costs part of the entire system being sold together includes a significant revenue boost from an average of three to four times the cost of machinery to customers but increased margins i will touch on this in a minute omnicell should become extremely profitable soon as it focuses on improving operating costs that is a key reason for all its recent acquisitions ebita margins trend upwards on years after acquisitions at a rate around  prior acquisitions were not as large in scale so a lowercost model has to be accepted when valuing omnicell estimates suggest a  increase in operating profit margin the margins getting larger will bring omcl to the top of its competitors in the market as well in the prior three years omnicells ebita margin was beating the industry average at  again this is without reaping the benefits of its most recent acquisitions ebita growth last year was roughly  which matches the industry average even with significantly skewed financials including significant sga accounts for expanding the marketing team that expense will be justified as it enters india europe and south america by the end of  and its revenue growth continues at a compounded doubledigit rate when these cognitive functions start fluently working together omcl will be the front runner of the competition in the market and in hospitals leaving others in a race to match it estimates suggest  growth in  but i believe this is low with its product scaling backlog growth and plans to enter three new markets this is where i believe investors can capitalize if we look at past data for future projections guidance the company historically grows revenue at an annual rate of  which will not slow down last year alone omnicell grew at  analysts suggest a  cagr in the it healthcare sector until  the corporate guidance is tapering off its growth but that is too soon and we can continue to expect doubledigit growth for at least four years on top of the favorable sector outlook omnicell has been growing its backlog sales significantly as of last year  in fact while maintaining a  conversion ratio if it were to maintain the conversion rate alone omnicell would beat its  revenue growth projections overall the company offers bestinclass products followed by a solid business model that will allow it to capture a greater market share it is also going to be best in class for financial ratios that competitors will not be able to match based on its potential to grow individually as well as the macroeconomic outlook for the sector it is an
