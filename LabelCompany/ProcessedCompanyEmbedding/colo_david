measures was included with the company’s press release issued earlier today also please note that unless otherwise stated all figures discussed today are in us dollars and are occasionally rounded to the nearest million and i’d now like to turn the conference over to sunopta’s ceo david colo david colo good morning and thank you for joining us i am joined today by rob mckeracher our chief financial officer let me begin by briefly discussing our first quarter performance and then i will update you on progress against the value creation plan adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million up from  million during the fourth quarter and compared to  million a year ago we generated a sequential improvement in adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda dollars during the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter as we have previously discussed there were significant nonstructural costs incurred as we are frontend loading the work on the value creation plan however we expect these nonrecurring costs to moderate as  progresses gross margin for the quarter on an adjusted basis was  compared to an adjusted gross margin of  a year ago and increased  basis points from the fourth quarter adjusted gross margin of  compared to the first quarter of  revenue declined  on an adjusted basis however we experienced  growth versus the fourth quarter of  which despite some seasonality is an encouraging recovery for the quarter as we discussed last quarter there has been a sharp drop in consumer demand for frozen fruit due primarily to higher onshelf prices in the freezer in contrast to an oversupply that peaked in the fresh market in late  these unfavorable market conditions have impacted the entire iqf fruit industry including our business as a result we experienced a  decline – revenue decline in the healthy fruit in the first quarter in addition the very strong growth we experienced in the first quarter of  made for a difficult comparison looking ahead we are noticing some positive signs on the horizon for frozen fruit the latest week consumption data for the period ending april   suggests that while the overall category of iqf fruit declined  on a dollar basis private label iqf fruit grew  on a dollar basis we are also continuing our efforts to further understand consumer and retailer needs as we position our iqf portfolio for future growth opportunities we generated good growth in healthy beverage premium juice sales rose  and aseptic sales increased  as noted last quarter we are in the process of winding down one of our private label aseptic contracts that we expect will be partially offset by strong demand from a large food service customer and additional broth and nondairy items being launched in the retail channel healthy snacks were relatively flat on a reported basis but up  on an adjusted basis led by bars and fruit snacks the focus of the process sustainability – excuse me finally global ingredients declined approximately  on an unadjusted basis however if we adjust for the impact of lower commodity prices foreign exchange and the impact of the sunflower recall the segment posted a  decline our north american ingredients business remained consistent with the recent trends declining approximately  on an adjusted basis while our international sourcing operations saw  adjusted decline against a very strong quarter a year ago when growth had been compounding at doubledigit rates last quarter we laid out some of the initial strategic actions we have and will be taking this year as we previously noted the first phase of the value creation plan is targeting implementation of  million of productivitydriven annualized ebitda enhancements over  and  and  million of working capital efficiencies by the end of the year in the near term these benefits are expected to be offset by structural investments made in the areas of quality sales marketing operations engineering and other functional resources additionally the company is incurring nonstructural thirdparty consulting support severance and recruiting costs the plan also calls for an increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies over time these investments are expected to yield ebitda improvements that go beyond the  million that is being targeted in the first phase now let me give you an update on our progress on each of the four pillars of the value creation plan the focus of the process sustainability pillar is to ensure the company has the infrastructure systems and skills to achieve and sustain the business improvements and value captured from the value creation plan strengthening and broadening the skill set and experience of sunopta’s leadership team is a critical component to the process sustainability pillar and i am pleased to tell you the team is now fully in place over the past few months in addition to my appointment as ceo we have added a chief operating officer for consumer products a chief human resources officer a chief information officer a chief quality officer a senior vice president of operations and engineering and a senior vice president of supply chain in addition to filling other management level positions in the areas of sales marketing customer marketing engineering operations quality and other functional support services we have also made progress in improving service levels to our customers by implementing a sales and operations planning process in key parts of the business we will systematically expand this process across all segments as we position the company to deliver bestinclass order fill rates and ontime delivery performance to our customers in order to improve the quality of information we utilized to run the business we have several data foundations projects underway the initial areas of focus are product costing inventory management master data governance specification management and kpi and functional reporting i am very pleased with the success we have had in attracting experienced leaders to sunopta which is a testament to the opportunity we have in front of us it all starts with people the changes we have made over the past few months were critical to reset the tone from the top adding much needed leadership and experience with the senior leadership team in place and the value creation plan well underway the da of the company is quickly migrating to a performancebased culture that highly values continuous improvement and demands accountability we have also established key performance indicators for the organization to measure and track performance to guest these kpis focus on employee safety food safety and quality customer service productivity and cost as well as revenue gross margin ebitda and working capital the focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food safety and quality coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency these efforts are expected to generate productivity improvements and cost savings and manufacturing procurements and logistics our top priority remains enhancing food safety and quality during the first quarter of  we launched networkwide upgrades to worker safety and food safety and quality programs with the goal of becoming a leader in safety and quality across the healthy food industry at the same time we have been identifying and implementing cost savings initiatives to increase productivity in our manufacturing operations and lowering procurement and logistics costs we expect to see the benefits of these initiatives start to accelerate in the second quarter and into the back half of  since the initiation of value creation plan the company has implemented process improvements and cost savings which are expected to yield  million of annualized ebitda benefits the focus of the go to market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels and to identify and penetrate new high potential sales channels the company expects efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time during the first quarter we implemented a revamped go to market approach emphasizing proactive engagement with current and prospective customers we also generated business wins with existing and new customers and existing and new categories across frozen fruit healthy beverage and global ingredients organizationally we continue to build out our food service and retail sales and marketing capabilities and the new talent in these areas is hard at work building a robust pipeline of sales opportunities to pursue timed in parallel with needed capital and process improvements at several of our facilities we also strategically adjusted pricing for certain consumer product offerings driving expanded margins since the initiation of the value creation plan the company has implemented go to market improvements which are expected to yield  million of annualized ebitda benefits the focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business investing where structural advantages exist while exiting businesses or product lines where the company is not effectively positioned this pillar was the first one we acted against upon launching the value creation plan which led to the decision to close two underperforming facilities during the first quarter we continue to evaluate product rationalization opportunities to enhance margins we also appointed john ruelle as senior vice president of corporate development john will focus on ma activities and product rationalization opportunities in addition to his responsibilities of managing the north american ingredients business since the initiation of the value creation plan the company has implemented portfolio changes which are expected to yield  million of annualized ebitda benefits as we previously mentioned in the nearterm all of the benefits derived from the value creation plan will be reinvested back into the business this reinvestment was evident during the first quarter and is needed to solidify the company’s foundation and establish the right trajectory for the business before i hand the call over to rob let me reiterate the wewill statements i introduce to you last quarter as they are a key driver of how we manage and operate our business we will focus on food safety quality and execution we will be focused in decisive as we execute our strategic plan we will focus on longterm value creation and we will make decisions with the longterm focus even if those decisions do not maximize nearterm earnings i will now turn the call over to rob to go through the first quarter financial results rob robert mckeracher thanks dave i will take you through the rest of the key financial statistics as well as balance sheet and cash flow metrics of the first quarter as dave mentioned first quarter revenue was  million a  decline as reported or  excluding the impact on revenues from changes at commodity related pricing foreign exchange rates the estimated impact of the sunflower recall and the estimated impact on the snacks platform due to a fire at a thirdparty pouch processing facility in  the global ingredients segment generated revenues from external customers of  million a decline of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  excluding the impact of commodity related pricing foreign exchange and the estimated impact of the sunflower recall global ingredients revenue decreased  the revenue decline reflected lower volume of specialty raw materials driven by a reduction in contracted acres and lower volumes of internationally sourced ingredients mainly due to weather related delays and accessing to raw materials from eastern europe and lower sales volume of low margin animal feed the consumer product segment generated revenues from external customers of  million during the first quarter of  a decrease of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  excluding the impact of a fire at the thirdparty pouch processing facility revenues in consumer products decreased  compared to the first quarter of  this decrease largely reflects a  decline in our healthy food platform as a result of lower retail iqf sales due to a decline in consumer consumption partially offset by increased sales of custom fruit formulations the lower frozen fruit sales were partially offset by a  increase in aseptic beverage sales and a  increase in sales of shelf stable and refrigerated juice products for the first quarter of  gross profit was  million or  of revenues compared to  million or  in the first quarter of  excluding the  million of costs related to the wind down of the san bernardino juice facility as well as an estimated  million of costs associated with the sunflower recall gross margin for the first quarter of  would have been  compared to an adjusted gross margin of  a year ago as compared to the fourth quarter of  on an adjusted basis gross margin increased  basis points from  reflecting improved cost control and efficiencies due in part to increased production volume inside our consumer products manufacturing operations for the first quarter we reported an operating loss of  million compared to operating income of  million in the first quarter of  adjusting for wind down costs the impact of the sunflower recall and  million of nonstructural sga costs relating to consulting fees temporary labor employee recruitment and retention costs associated with the value creation plan operating income in the first quarter would have been  million or  of revenues compared to  million or  of revenues in the first quarter of  on an adjusted basis on a gaap basis for the first quarter we reported a loss from continuing operations of  million or  per diluted common share compared to a loss from continuing operations of  million or  per diluted common share in the first quarter of  and  million or  per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of  first quarter results include several charges and items that are not reflective of normal operations and have been excluded in calculating adjusted earnings these items include  million in costs related to the value creation plan reflecting asset impairments and severance costs as well as the previously mentioned costs associated with the wind down of the san bernardino juice facility and nonstructural sga costs in addition to lost ph gross profit and other direct costs related to the sunflower recall and other expense items for the first quarter of  we reported an adjusted loss from continuing operations of  million or  per diluted common share compared to adjusted earnings of  million or  per diluted common share in the first quarter of  and an adjusted loss of  million or  per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of  we realized adjusted ebitda of  million compared to  million during the first quarter of  and  million during the fourth quarter of  i would like to remind listeners that adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings are nongaap measures and a reconciliation of these measures to gaap can be found towards the back of the press release issued earlier this morning from a cash flow perspective during the first quarter of  we generated  million of cash from continuing operations compared to cash used in continuing operations of  million in the first quarter of  the improvement in cash from operations was driven by a focused reduction in working capital due largely to liquidity optimization efforts undertaken as part of the value creation plan i would like to remind listeners that our working capital requirements are seasonal and we expect to use cash to fund working capital in the second quarter due primarily to the timing of the fruit harvest we continue to target  million of increased cash flow during  generated by efforts to lower working capital during the first quarter we spent  million on capital expenditures compared to  million in the first quarter of  capital spending in the first quarter of  related primarily to facility upgrades and automated sorting enhancements in our frozen fruit operations additional roasting capacity at our cocoa processing facility in holland quality and safety enhancements in our sunflower operations and the lease buyout of equipment at the former san bernardino juice facility as previously mentioned we expect our capital spending to trend higher in  in support of the value creation plan to solidify the foundation of our operations and also to achieve a number of productivity improvements we continue to expect capital spending for  to be in the range of  million to  million during the first quarter bank indebtedness declined  million and total debt declined  million to  million on april   our leverage was approximately x adjusted ebitda on a trailing fourquarter basis after eliminating the negative impact on ebitda from the san bernardino juice facility from a liquidity perspective we ended the quarter with approximately  million of available capacity on our global assetbased credit facility and remain wellpositioned with sufficient capital resources to support the value creation plan i will now turn the call back over to dave for some closing remarks dave david colo thanks rob as we have previously discussed the value creation plan will have three distinct phases during the first phase we don’t expect meaningful revenue growth however we expect to generate increased gross margin as a percentage of revenue this will be partially offset by increased investment in sga as i mentioned earlier this investment is necessary to build the foundation for consistent profitable growth for the second and third phases we expect revenue to increase as our gotomarket initiatives take hold driving incremental gross profit dollars in addition we expect continued gross margin expansion as a result of improved utilization in our plants and the benefit from our productivity initiatives the investment in sga will be complete by the second phase and by the third phase we expect to leverage our sga investment further enhancing ebitda margins finally in phase  the effective growing revenue and expanding margins is anticipated to result in substantial free cash flow generation we look forward to updating you each quarter on our progress with that i will turn it back to the operator to facilitate qa operator questionandanswer session operator thank you mr colo operator instructions our first question comes from jon andersen with william blair your question please jon andersen good morning everybody thank you david maybe i will start with the last comment you made around the value creation plan and the three phases it’s helpful to understand kind of what to expect within each of those phases in terms of revenue margins profitability and cash flow do you have any thoughts you can help us with respect to the timing or duration of those three phases that you described or is it just too early at this point david colo yes i think john as we kind of discussed on the last call i think the first phase we are viewing is a  to month process and then the second and third phase anywhere from the  to  month phase so we are really a little over a quarter into this process but i think those are fairly realistic timeframes as we see them today jon andersen excellent okay shifting gears on the consumer products business talk a little bit more if you would about the frozen fruit kind of business the category trends in general and to what extent we should be really encouraged or thinking about maybe better consumption trends going forward based on some of the latest fourweek data – have we kind of worked through the pricing issue at this point or are there more kind of pressures to come but just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there and what your expectations maybe for that business are maybe moved through the year david colo sure yes i think as we have discussed previously what we think was a big driver of some of the category decline was this – the pricing actions that have been taken over the last few years and iqf fruit have been relatively significant and last year there was somewhat of an anomaly that occurred in that there was an oversupply of fresh fruit which delayed the harvest if you will going to the iqf fruit which caused our iqf fruit costs to go up we had to take pricing obviously at retail to offset that and it created a pretty good gap between iqf pricing and fresh pricing at retail we think that’s what’s driven down the iqf consumption todate as we are coming into kind of the new fruit harvest season here and we have taken some actions to normalize pricing we think that that’s what’s maybe driving some of the growth back into the private label category it’s early we had one quad week that showed this kind of trend starting to reverse but even the quad weeks prior to this one we saw that although the category was declining it was declining at a lower rate if you will so one quad week doesn’t a trend make but we think as the pricing returns to more historical levels and the delta between iqf fruit pricing and fresh gets back to historical levels we are encouraged that we think the category might continue to grow jon andersen and we are hearing from others that there maybe – maybe a renewed focus at least among some large fruit retailers on private label as a way to improve the economics of their stores and also create a price halo and provide a certain level of differentiation is this something that you are seeing in potentially not just within fruit but broader across your consumer products portfolio and is that an opportunity for you going forward david colo yes i mean i think private label offers tremendous value and we are very encouraged by some of the trends in private label broadly so i think with our portfolio we are well positioned to take advantage of that we have good diversification in the portfolio to take advantage of it and i think with our new gotomarket approach that we are taking by focusing on key customers in key channels and bringing kind of more intelligence to our customer base with how we have added additional talent in the organization to be more knowledgeable about the consumer and the categories that we compete in we see – we think there is some good potential growth opportunities for us jon andersen okay if i can squeeze a couple more and i will get back in the queue on the beverage business there are some transitions going on and you mentioned this in your prepared comments there is a wind down of one piece of business but it sounds like you have had some wins in other parts of the beverage business could you help us a little bit with maybe how the impact of this transition will play out over the next quarter or two so that we are kind of prepared for that and can quantify it as well as possible in our models david colo yes i think we will probably see a slight dip in revenue over the next couple of quarters and then as some of this new business takes hold that should start offsetting it we are anticipating for the year to be relatively flat on the beverage versus prior year jon andersen great okay last one for me the portfolio work that you are doing and continue to do is there any kind of update there with respect to potentially bigger kind of simplification decisions just your thoughts as you have kind of continue to kind of work through the portfolio and look for opportunities to kind of get more focused improved profitability thanks david colo yes nothing significant jon versus what we spoke to in the last quarter we continue to look for opportunities to call out unprofitable skus and product lines and things of that nature that work will always be something that we do on an ongoing basis but nothing significant to report at this point operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from amit sharma with bmo capital markets your question please amit sharma hi good morning everyone david colo good morning amit sharma david just going back to the frozen fruit segment i mean i think you are signaling that the price delta between fresh and frozen is at the heart of this sales compression that we are seeing in that business but the question really is that this probably is not the first time we have seen these price gaps perhaps narrow as much as they have in this environment can you go back and maybe talk about some of the previous times when this happened and how long did it take for frozen business to come back or frozen growth to come back and also the margin recovery associated with that robert mckeracher sure it’s rob i’ll try and take that just based on sunopta’s experience following the acquisition of sunrise growers early in the fourth quarter of ‘  was a similar dynamic where prices in the freezer continue to grow and we did see actually in our first quarter postacquisition a little bit of price elasticity but it came back quite quickly in the first quarter of ‘ and we attribute a big part of that due to the fact that the disparity between fresh and frozen was not as great then but fruit prices have been on the rise for a number of years preceding the  harvest what we had is a situation in ‘ where the dynamic if you will on supply and demand and if you remember back in the second quarter last year where one of our big headwinds is the fact that the growing conditions allowed for dairy growers to really service the fresh market longer it really pushed and like what i would say considered to be a more extreme kind of year extreme between the delta between fresh and frozen both supply and then of course price so while there has been ups and downs i mean clearly in a business like this you are going to have this dynamic going on we consider  to be a fairly extreme event and so from our perspective as prices appear to be coming down and as we are hopeful and are expecting that delta decreases consumers will migrate back to growth out of the freezer because of the convenience and because of the usage occasions and everything else that we think will continue to drive that category longterm amit sharma and then i think last quarter you mentioned some of the things that you could perhaps do to improve pricing in that maybe local iqf production in mexico can you elaborate on that a little bit if pricing does remain a concern in this category what other things sunopta do to mitigate that david colo i think with our manufacturing and distribution network we are well positioned we do have a facility in mexico we are optimizing the throughput and the capacity of that facility we may look to further expand that facility to take advantage of the cost economics we also have a facility in the midwest that allows us to bring fruit in from either mexico or california package it there and then hit the east coast very economically so those are some of the things that we have historically done and we will continue to emphasize going forward to try to make sure we stay cost competitive amit sharma got it and then david just broader question as you are meeting with your top customers and laying out the vision for the reformed or change sunopta what’s the consistent feedback i mean is there a clear need for sunopta to be a different company or what are you hearing from them – from your customers in terms of hey these are the top two or three things that if sunopta did then i think we can have a better strategic relationship rather than just a price based transaction david colo yes there is very strong demand for the products that sunopta supplies to the market the very consistent theme that i have heard since i have been hearing from our customers is that we haven’t been done as reliable as supplier as they would like and that comes brown to a couple of areas primarily customer service meaning that our fill rates to our customers and our ontime delivery performance to our customers has not been at the level that’s satisfactory so that’s why you have heard me speak to the sales and operations planning processes that we put in place to ensure that we have the right product at the right time for our customers that’s been a very consistent message as well as just making sure that we consistently produce a quality product and a food safe product for our customers those two things have kind of been the achilles heel of the company and that’s why you see us putting so much focus and emphasis on those particular items amit sharma and just to elaborate on that what’s the reward if you do or if you are able to make substantial improvement in these two areas david colo i think it’s what we have spoken to relative to the value creation plan and the timing of getting the foundational elements of this company set up properly that’s going to enable us to be operationally sound and execute consistently day in and day out and i think as a result of that over time we will continue to grow our top line in a more cost effective company which should generate expanded margins and improved growth in ebitda amit sharma got it thank you so much david colo thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chris krueger with lake street capital your question please chris krueger hi good morning david colo hi chris chris krueger hi back to your aseptic beverage business i know you have had multiple expansions in recent years i know you are winding down large customer but bringing on some other new customers i was just wondering where your – how much capacity do you have and what’s your utilization rate right now and where do you see that going by the end of the year david colo yes i mean the good news is we have plenty of capacity i think we are running around probably   utilization and we expect that similar to the revenue story we told earlier about beverage we think it will be relatively flat top line for the year so that utilization is going to stay roughly in that range but we are building a robust pipeline of ideas to grow the top line in the business so over the next – as we get into  and beyond we expect that utilization factor to increase chris krueger okay and then it’s been while since i have heard an update on the aseptic pouch business can you tell us what’s going on with that robert mckeracher yes sure chris i mean – so that indiscernible obviously i commented in my remarks that we did loose one the smaller side of that if you will by way of a fire at the thirdparty copacking facility last year but the pouch business in allentown i think that folks were generally where we have a fairly concentrated customer list there but it remains important part of the portfolio in the snacks business we are not seeing a great deal of growth there right now we are fairly full in terms of our utilization of that facility but it’s an area where we continue to evaluate we see opportunities potentially for innovation and yes it will be a focus chris krueger alright thank you robert mckeracher thanks operator thank you and we have a followup question from mr amit sharma from bmo capital markets your line is open amit sharma hi thank you so much for taking the followup just two quick ones from me david you mentioned potentially some products rationalization is there a way for you to quantify the size or perhaps the timing of that and then the second one is related to custom fruit it looks like that part of the business is still growing can you talk about what is the relative size of that business and what’s the trend in that david colo yes on the product rationalization not really prepared to give any quantitative aspect to that it’s more of an ongoing process that we will look at our entire portfolio look at any potential sku our product rationalization for unprofitable items that’s pretty much the extent of that at this point on the custom formulation the fruit business that is a – we like that business it’s a very much a solution sales type business where we work very proactively with our customer base to develop customized formulations to meet their specific needs and it’s been a – we do see some pretty good growth in that business we expect to try to continue to leverage the capabilities of that business for growth and we like the margin structure in the business amit sharma got it thank you so much david colo thank you operator thank you i show no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to mr colo – apologies we have one additional question from mr anderson with william blair your line is open jon andersen hi thanks for taking the additionals the ebitda enhancement items that you have identified you spoke to in the prepared comments and quantified in the press release have those – have any of those been realized todate or are those benefits that have been identified that will be delivered as you move through  and then the second part of my question is with respect to the nonstructural costs are you still thinking about that as a  million investment in the year i know it’s kind of front end loaded to the first half i think and does that kind of role off as we get into  thanks robert mckeracher sure thanks jon it’s rob i will take that one so yes in terms of the kind of the implemented if you will savings that we have generated from the pillars of value creation plan think of that as essentially – actually taking a great example will be the san bernardino closure where we have taken the action we have concluded the action we can – the way we are approaching is that we want to make sure there is enough of a run rate on our pl and we have actually got an auditing function that goes into audits that in fact the savings that we were expecting are there we can see them and frankly that they will stick to the pl and so that’s kind of the approach that we are taking as we start to report against let’s say how we are making against let’s say how we are making against a  million objective as you were to add up what we have put out in the there in the prepared comments that come up to  million so you can expect to see most of that certainly arrive in  obviously the amount that arrives in here is very dependent on when we implement and start realizing the benefit from these initiatives so that’s something you can expect that we will continue to do quarterafterquarter as we want to give folks the ability to see how we are making from a dollars perspective at least against the value creation plan in terms of the costs we are – we have basically guided that we expect  million of nonstructural costs to land this year in support of the value creation plan you are right it is frontend loading we have incurred about  million out of that  million so far what you will see in the press releases is  million that relates to san bernardino that we are attributing to the value creation plan but frankly that was the  decision and ‘ event so there is about  million to go and i think you can expect to see most of that come through here in the second and third quarter i expect all that spending to subside after  jon andersen thank you operator thank you i show no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr colo for closing remarks david colo thank you operator and thank you for participating in our first quarter conference call i look forward to speaking with you in the future and updating you in our progress as we unlock the opportunity and value in sunopta we are well positioned in the right categories at the right
