of a  loan from mr hicks as described in this prospectus this loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out of the proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account º the underwriters have agreed to defer approximately  million of their underwriting commissions or approximately  million if the overallotment option is exercised in full which equals  of the gross proceeds of this offering until consummation of initial business combination upon consummation of our initial business combination approximately  million which constitutes the underwriters deferred commissions or approximately  million if the underwriters over allotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs general corporate purposes payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital a total of approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus including approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at jp morgan chase na with continental stock transfer  trust company as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act except for a portion of the interest income that may be released to us the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation commencing on the closing of this offering we have agreed to pay hicks holdings operating an entity owned and controlled by thomas o hicks our founder and chairman of the board a total of  per month for office space administrative services and secretarial support this arrangement is being agreed to by mr hicks for our benefit and is not intended to provide mr hicks compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by mr hicks will approximate the monthly reimbursement we believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees we believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up to  million subject to adjustment earned on the trust account balance net of taxes payable that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us to the extent that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase up to approximately  million we will use such proportionate increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses while we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering we believe that any additional interest income released to us would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets as of the date of this prospectus mr hicks our founder and chairman of the board has advanced to us a total of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these advances are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested by the trustee only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act because the investment of the proceeds will be restricted to these instruments we believe we will meet the requirements for the exemption provided in rule a promulgated under the us investment company act of  interest income of up to  million subject to adjustment on the trust account balance net of taxes payable may be released to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital requirements in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore º our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or obtain necessary financial information may delay the completion of a transaction º our obligation to repurchase for cash shares of common stock held by our public stockholders who vote against the business combination and exercise their conversion rights may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination º we will not consummate a business combination if holders of more than  minus one share of our outstanding shares of common stock sold in this offering exercise their conversion rights º our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses and º the requirement to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have a fair market value equal to at least  of the balance of the trust account at the time of the acquisition excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full could require us to acquire the assets of several businesses at the same time all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the other sales which could make it more difficult to consummate the initial business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company formed under the general corporation law of the state of delaware for the purpose of acquiring or acquiring control of through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination one or more businesses or assets we have not identified any acquisition target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions with an entity that we will acquire in our initial business combination our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular industry but we will not enter into a business combination with any entity engaged in the energy industry as its principal business or whose principal business operations are conducted outside of the united states or canada we will seek to capitalize on the significant investing experience of our management team including the  years of private equity expertise of thomas o hicks our founder and chairman of the board since  mr hicks has served as the chairman of hicks holdings llc a holding company for sports real estate and private equity investments of mr hicks and his family including the national hockey leagues dallas stars purchased in december  major league baseballs texas rangers acquired in june  and a  interest in the english premier leagues liverpool football club acquired in march  hicks holdings is also the controlling shareholder of latrobe specialty steel company a specialty steel manufacturer its other corporate holdings include direcpath a company that provides bundled directv programming broadband

professionals and river city landscape supply a provider of bulk and bagged mulches soils and decorative rocks hicks holdings also holds approximately  of the equity of greatwide logistics services a us nonasset based provider of dedicated transportation thirdparty logistics warehousedistribution and truckload brokerage solutions mr hicks cofounded hicks muse tate  furst a nationally prominent private equity firm in the united states that specialized in leveraged acquisitions and served as chairman from  through  during mr hicks tenure as chairman hicks muse raised over  billion of private equity funds consummated over  billion of leveraged acquisitions and was one of the most active private investment firms in the country mr hicks also cofounded and served as cochief executive officer of the leveraged buyout firm hicks  haas from  to  subject to the requirements that our initial business combination have a fair market value of at least  of the initial amount held in a trust account at jp morgan chase na with continental stock transfer  trust company as trustee excluding deferred underwriting commissions of  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses we will only consummate our initial business combination if we will become the controlling stockholder of the target the key factor we will rely on in determining controlling stockholder status would be our acquisition of more than half of the voting equity interests of the target company we will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities however we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines º established companies with proven track records we will seek to acquire established companies with sound historical financial performance we will typically focus on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results we do not intend to acquire startup companies º companies with strong free cash flow characteristics we will seek to acquire companies that have a history of strong stable free cash flow generation we will focus on companies that have predictable recurring revenue streams and an emphasis on low working capital and capital expenditure requirements º strong competitive industry position we will seek to acquire businesses that operate within industries that have strong fundamentals the factors we will consider include growth prospects competitive dynamics level of consolidation need for capital investment and barriers to entry within these industries we will focus on companies that have a leading or niche market position we will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors focusing on product quality customer loyalty cost impediments associated with customers switching to competitors patent protection and brand positioning we will seek to acquire businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors which may help to protect their market position and profitability and deliver strong free cash flow º experienced management team we will seek to acquire businesses that have strong experienced management teams we will focus on management teams with a proven track record of driving revenue growth enhancing profitability and generating strong free cash flow we believe that the operating expertise of our officers and directors will complement not replace the targets management team º diversified customer and supplier base we will seek to acquire businesses that have a diversified customer and supplier base companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns industry consolidation changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers suppliers and competitors we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources including investment bankers venture capital funds private equity funds leveraged buyout funds management buyout funds and other members of the financial community target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings these sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting our officers and directors as well as their affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have as well as by attending trade shows or conventions in addition we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of mr hicks our founder and chairman of the board we have not established any other specific attributes or criteria financial or otherwise for prospective target businesses in evaluating a prospective target business our management may consider a variety of factors including one or more of the following º financial condition and results of operations  growth potential º brand recognition and potential º experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel º capital requirements º stage of development of the business and its products or services º existing distribution arrangements and the potential for expansion º degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products or services º proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas º impact of regulation on the business º regulatory environment of the industry º seasonal sales fluctuations and the ability to offset these fluctuations through other business combinations introduction of new products or product line extensions º costs associated with effecting the business combination º industry leadership sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market sectors in which a target business participates and º macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based to the extent relevant on the above factors as well as other considerations factors and criteria our management deems relevant to our business objective in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews interviews of customers and suppliers inspection of facilities as well as review of financial and other information which will be made available to us in order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple corporate affiliations each of our officers has agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that until the earliest of our initial business combination our liquidation or such time as he or she ceases to be an officer to present to our company for our consideration prior to presentation to any other entity any business opportunity with a fair market value of  million or more subject to any preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she might have as more fully discussed in managementconflicts of interest on page  in the event that any of our officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us each of our officers other than thomas o hicks jr and mack hicks currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations which may take priority over their duties to us if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months after the date of this prospectus and expend all of the net proceeds of this offering other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account and without taking into account interest if any earned on the trust account the initial pershare liquidation price would be  or  less than the perunit offering price of  the per share liquidation price includes approximately  million in deferred underwriting commissions or approximately  million
