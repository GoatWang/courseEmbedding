fund inc goals and strategies goals  the funds investment goals are the accumulation of dividend income and longterm capital appreciation strategies  the fund uses its corporate structure to create dividend income to the fund by utilizing the funds  deduction from federal income taxes for dividends received the remaining  of the funds income is used primarily to pay for expenses of running the fund the result unless the federal accumulated earnings tax is imposed on the fund is that the federal income taxes that would otherwise be payable by the fund are greatly reduced see main risks the funds policy of maximizing dividend income together with its structure enable the funds assets to be managed so as to avoid the necessity of making annual taxable distributions to shareholders dividends and capital gains are not distributed but rather are accumulated within the fund and are added to the value of each share on a daily basis any increase in per share value directly raises the value of each shareholders account upon redemption the shareholder will incur a loss or realize a gain or income which may be subject to income taxation depending upon per share value at the time of redemption the fund is taxed as a corporation and dividends and capital gains are not distributed but rather accumulated within the fund and are added to the value of each share on a daily basis principal investments the fund will normally invest substantially all of its assets in the equity securities of  companies with strong balance sheets and with histories of dividend increases and  companies whose earnings growth potential enhances prospects for future increases in dividend rates the manager expects that more than  of the funds assets will be invested in such equity securities these types of securities generally entitle the holder to participate in a companys general operating results these include common stocks preferred stocks and convertible securities temporary investments the manager may take a temporary defensive position when it believes the markets or the economy are experiencing excessive volatility or a prolonged general decline or other adverse conditions exist under these circumstances the fund may be unable to pursue its investment goals because it may not invest or may not invest in equity securities at such times or in the event of exceptional redemption requests the fund may hold cash or cashequivelants and invest without limit in money market securities us government obligations and short term debt securities pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th operating business in an effort to enhance its performance and to preserve and promote its investment goal in the context of adverse tax law changes more fully discussed under main risks the fund has engaged on a limited basis in the luggage and related products business in order to maintain the funds status as a diversified investment company the value of the operating business is limited to  or less of the funds total assets and the gross profit therefrom is limited to  or less of the funds total annual gross income main risks  stocks while stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term they tend to go up and down more dramatically over the shorter term these price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies industries or the securities market as a whole interest rate when interest rates rise debt security prices fall when interest rates fall debt security prices go up  because the securities the fund holds fluxuate in price the value of your investment will go up and down this means you could lose money over short or even extended periods generally interest rates rise during times of inflation or a growing economy and will fall during an economic slowdown or recession securities with longer maturities usually are more sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter maturities utilities industry while the fund does not concentrate its assets in any one industry it may at times have a substantial portion of its assets invested in utility companies at such times the funds performance is closely tied to conditions affecting the public utilities industry which may change rapidly utility company securities are particularly sensitive to interest rate movements when interest rates rise the stock prices of these companies tend to fall ongoing regulatory changes have led to greater competition in the industry and the emergenge of nonregulated providers as a significant part of the industry which may make some companies less profitable in addition the industry is subject to risks associated with the difficulty of obtaining adequate returns on invested capital in spite of frequent rate increases and of financing large construction programs during inflationary periods restrictions on operations and increased costs due to environmental and safety regulations difficulties of the capital markets inabsorbing utility debt and equity securities difficulties in obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices risks associated with the operation of nuclear power plants and the effects of energy conservation and other factors affecting the level of demand for services pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th operating business the manager believes that the conduct of the operating business eliminates or at the least minimizes the risk that the fund will be subject to federal accumulated earnings tax in the event the managers position is found wrong by the irs or changes are made to existing tax laws and regulations the fund could be held liable for accumulated earnings tax by the irs in this event the funds net asset value would be reduced by any such liability and each shareholder would incur a proportionate decrease in the value of their account foreign securities securities of companies and governments located outside the us may involve risks that can increase the potential for losses in the fund investments in depositary receipts also involve some or all of the following risks country general securities market movements in any country where the fund has investments are likely to affect the value of the securities the fund owns which trade in that country these movements will affect the funds share price and fund performance the political economic and social structures of some countries the fund invests in may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us the risks of investing in these countries include the possibility of the imposition of exchange controls currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations expropriation restrictions on removal of currency or other assets nationalization of assets punitive taxes and certain custody and settlement risks the funds investments in developing or emerging markets are subject to all of the risks of foreign investing generally and have additional heightened risks due to a lack of established legal business and social frameworks to support securities markets foreign securities markets including emerging markets may have substantially lower trading volumes than us markets resulting in less liquidity and more volatility than experienced in the us while short term volatility in these markets can be disconcerting declines in excess of  are not unusual  if a securitys credit rating is downgraded or a companys financial condition deteriorates the price of the security will fall and so too will the funds share price if interest rates rise the value of the funds debt securities will also fall because the value of the funds holdings fluctuates in price the value of your investment in the fund will go up and down this means you could lose money over short or even extended periods pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th year  when evaluating current and potential portfolio positions year  is one of the factors the funds manager considers the manager will rely upon public filings and other statements made by companies about their year  readiness issuers in countries outside the us particularly in emerging markets may not be required to make the same level of disclosure about year  readiness as is required in the us the manager of course cannot audit each company and its major suppliers to verify their year  readiness if a company in which the fund is invested is adversely affected by year  problems it is likely that the price of its security will also be adversely affected a decrease in the value of one or more of the funds portfolio holdings will have a similar impact on the price of the funds shares and the funds performance please see section on year  problems for more information  mutual fund shares are not deposits or obligations of or guaranteed or endorsed by any bank and are not federally insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve board or any other agency of the us government mutual fund shares involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th insert the following performance fees and expenses example management copley financial services inc manager po box  fall river massachusetts  is the funds investment manager mr irving levine is responsible for the funds management he is president of the manager and has managed the fund since its inception in  for its services the manager received a fee of  of average net assets during the last fiscal year financial highlights distributions and taxes  the fund does not normally make income or capital gains distributions it is taxed as a regular corporation under the internal revenue code accordingly the fund retains all net investment income and realized capital gains if any to increase the funds net assets consequently shareholders are not individually liable for income taxes associated with the operations of the fund except upon sale of shares or the receipt of distributions the fund is taxed for federal income tax purposes on a schedule of rates ranging from  to  depending upon its taxable income however a  additional tax rate applies to phase out the benefits of the graduated rates if the funds taxable income is between  and  subject to specific limitations the fund is entitled to a deduction in computing its federal taxable income equal to  of the amount of dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations this dividends received deduction may not exceed  of the funds taxable income unless the fund has a net operating loss for a taxable year as computed after deducting the dividend received deduction it is anticipated although there can be no assurance that the funds management fees and other expenses may offset a substantial portion of the remaining  of the dividend income and investment income from other sources during each taxable year the fund pays income taxes on any net realized capital gain at the statutory rate noted above in addition the fund will for financial statement purposes accrue deferred income taxes on net unrealized capital gains that are expected to be realized at the fund level the fund may carry net capital losses forward for five years as an offset against any net capital gains realized by the fund during the current year legislative or regulatory changes in or interpretations of applicable federal tax laws regulations or rulings may make it impossible for the fund to utilize certain of the tax management techniques and strategies described in the prospectus the fund intends to evaluate continuously the operations of the fund under the current federal tax laws as well as various alternatives available pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th accumulated earnings tax since the fund accumulates rather than distributes its income the fund may be subject to the imposition of the federal accumulated earnings tax the aet the aet is imposed on a corporations accumulated taxable income the att for each taxable year at the rate of  ati is defined as the adjusted taxable income of the fund minus the sum of the dividends paid deduction and the accumulated earnings credit the dividends paid deduction and the accumulated earnings credit is available only if the fund is not held to be a mere holding or investment company in the early part of  the fund commenced activities in the luggage and related products trade business the business is being operated as a division of the fund the value of business assets and their earnings are included in the net assets of the fund the assets of the operating division should not result in the fund ceasing to be an openend investment company under the act management believes that under existing law the funds operation of its active trade or business prevent the fund from being classified as a mere holding or investment company for purpose of the aet under that proposition the fund is entitled to a dividends paid deduction from ati for that portion of fund redemptions representing the amount of undistributed earnings accumulated since the inception of the fund and through the date of redemption allocable to the redeemed shares the internal revenue service has recently uphelod the managers position that the fund is not a mere holding or investment company since the fund is conducting an operating business provided the fund manages accumulated and annual earnings and profits in excess of  in such a manner that the funds are deemed to be obligated or consumed by capital losses redemptions and expansion of the operating division the fund will not be held liable for the accumulated earnings tax by the internal revenue service year  problem  the funds business operations depend on a worldwide network of computer systems that contain date fields including securities trading systems securities transfer agent operations and stock market links many of the systems currently use a two digit date field to represent the date and unless these systems are changed or modified they may not be able to distinguish the year  from the year  commonly referred to as the year  problem in addition the fact that the year  is a non standard leap year may create difficulties for some systems pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th when the year  arrives a funds operations could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the manager its service providers and other third parties it does business with are not year  ready for example the funds portfolio and operational areas could be impacted including securities trade processing interest and dividend payments securities pricing shareholder account services reporting custody functions and others the fund could experience difficulties in effecting transactions if any of its foreign markets are not ready for year  the funds manager and its affiliated service providers are making a conserted effort to take steps they believe are reasonably designed to address their year  problems of course the funds ability to reduce the effects of the year  problem is also very much dependent upon the efforts of third parties over which the fund and its manager may have no control further information  more

on june   the shareholders of the fund approved a change of its name to the copley tax managed fund inc the name was changed back to the copley fund inc effective march   pursuant to approval of the shareholders on february   the fund was reorganized as a new york corporation on september   and as a florida corporation on may  the fund is a noload diversified openend management investment company which seeks to invest in securities with the potential for favorable dividend returns and capital appreciation investment goals and strategies the primary investment goal of the fund is to achieve accumulation of dividend income and longterm capital growth income is sought primarily through investing in equity securities primarily common stocks including those listed on national securities exchanges and those traded in the national overthecounter market which are deemed to offer a possibility of attractive dividend returns management intends that assets of the fund will be kept fully invested except for reasonable amounts held in cash to meet current expenses or for temporary periods pending investment however when economic or market conditions warrant the fund as a temporary defensive position may invest part or all of its portfolio in investment grade bonds securities issued by the us government and its agencies or instrumentalities bankers acceptances or certificates of deposit the fund may invest its cash reserves in shortterm municipal obligations including tax bond and revenue anticipation notes construction loan and project financing notes taxexempt commercial paper and other municipal securities with maturities of less than  days the funds policy is to invest at least  of the value of its total assets in cash and cash items including receivables government securities and other securities while not investing an amount greater than  of the value of its total assets in any one issuer and not owning more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer there is no assurance that the funds investment goals can be achieved risks the value of your shares will increase as the value of the securities owned by the fund increases and will decrease as the value of the funds investments decrease in this way you participate in any change in the value of the securities owned by the fund in addition to the factors that affect the value of any particular security that the fund owns the value of fund shares may also change with movements in the stock and bond market as a whole interest rate risk to the extent the fund invests in debt securities changes in interest rates will affect the value of the funds portfolio and its share price rising interest rates which often occur during times of inflation or a growing economy are likely to have a negative effect on the value of the funds shares of course interest rates throughout the world have increased and decreased sometimes very dramatically in the past these changes are likely to occur again in the future at unpredictable times  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th foreign securities risk the value of foreign and us securities is affected by general economic conditions and individual company and industry earnings prospects while foreign securities may offer significant opportunities for gain they also involve additional risks that can increase the potential for losses in the fund these risks can be significantly greater for investments in emerging markets many of the risks described below also apply to investments in depository receipts the political economic and social structures of some countries in which a fund invests may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us the risks of investing in these countries include the possibility of the imposition of exchange controls expropriation restrictions on removal of currency or other assets nationalization of assets and punitive taxes there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company or government than about a us company or public entity certain countries financial markets and services are less developed than those in the us or other major economies as a result they may not have uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and may have less liquidity and more volatility than experienced in the us transaction costs on foreign securities markets are generally higher than in the us the settlement practices may be cumbersome and result in delays that may affect portfolio liquidity the fund may have greater difficulty voting proxies exercising shareholder rights pursuing legal remedies and obtaining judgments with respect to foreign investments in foreign courts than with respect to domestic issuers in us courts some of the countries in which the fund might invest are considered developing or emerging markets investments in these markets are subject to all of the risks of foreign investing generally and have additional and heightened risks due to a lack of legal business and social frameworks to support securities markets emerging markets involve additional significant risks including political and social uncertainty for example regional conflicts and risk of war currency exchange rate volatility pervasiveness of corruption and crime delays in settling portfolio transactions risk of loss arising out of the system of share registration and custody comparatively smaller and less liquid than developed markets dependency upon foreign economic assistance and international trade less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices stock exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th all of these factors make developing market equity and fixedincome securities prices generally more volatile than securities issued in developed countries euro risk on january   the european monetary union emu introduced a new single currency the euro which will replace the national currency for participating member countries the transition and the elimination of currency risk among emu countries may change the economic environment and behavior of investors particularly in european markets repurchase agreement risk the use of repurchase agreements involves certain risks for example if the other party to the agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying security at a time when the value of the security has declined the fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the security if the other party to the agreement becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or reorganization under the bankruptcy code or other laws a court may determine that the underlying security is collateral for a loan by the fund not within the control of the fund and therefore the realization by the fund on the collateral may be automatically stayed finally it is possible that the fund may not be able to substantiate its interest in the underlying security and may be deemed an unsecured creditor of the other party to the agreement while the manager acknowledges these risks it is expected that if repurchase agreements are otherwise deemed useful to the fund these risks can be controlled through careful monitoring procedures utilities risk historically electric utility companies were required by state regulators to build and maintain generation plants transmission and distribution lines and other equipment state regulators set the rates that the companies could charge customers to pay for these costs spread over as much as  years as the various states move away from the traditional regulatory model toward greater competitiveness among electric utilities customers will be able to choose different electricity suppliers and will no longer pay for the equipment and facilities that were mandated by regulators thus creating stranded costs for their former electricity suppliers if states fail to enact legislation that permits electricity suppliers to recover their stranded costs the financial position of these suppliers could be adversely affected which could cause the value of the funds holdings in such companies and its net asset value to fall tax risk because the fund accumulates rather than distributes its income the fund may be subject to the imposition of the federal accumulated earnings

proposition the fund is entitled to a dividends paid deduction from ati for that portion of fund redemptions representing the amount of undistributed earnings accumulated since the inception of the

since the fund is conducting an operating business provided the fund manages accumulated and annual earnings and profits in excess of  in such a manner that the funds are deemed to be obligated or consumed by capital losses redemptions and expansion of the operating division the fund will not be held liable for the accumulated earnings tax by the internal revenue service in the event an accumulated earnings tax would be assessed against the fund such assessment would decrease the net assets of the fund and have a proportionate negative affect on each shareholders account taxation of the fund unlike most all other mutual funds the fund is taxed as a regular corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code except to the extent hereinafter discussed the fund retains all net investment income and realized capital gains if any to increase the funds assets consequently shareholders are not individually liable for income taxes associated with the operations of the fund except upon sale of shares or the receipt of distributions the fund is taxed for federal income tax purposes on a schedule of rates ranging from  to  depending upon its taxable income however a  additional tax rate applies to phase out the benefits of the graduated rates if the funds taxable income is between  and  subject to specific limitations the fund is entitled to a deduction in computing its federal taxable income equal to  of the amount of dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations this dividends received deduction may not exceed  of the funds taxable income unless the fund has a net operating loss for a taxable year as computed after deducting the dividend received deduction it is anticipated although there can be no assurance that the funds management fees and other expenses may offset a substantial portion of the remaining  of the dividend income and investment income from other sources during each taxable year the fund pays income taxes on any net realized capital gain at the statutory rate noted above in addition the fund will for financial statement purposes accrue deferred income taxes on net unrealized capital gains that

in the context of the federal tax laws the fund has engaged on a limited basis in the luggage and related products business to facilitate the conduct of such an operating business the funds shareholders on february   approved changes in fundamental policy which expand the funds ability to borrow money and make loans with respect to an active trade or business the fund can now borrow up to onethird of the value of its total net assets and extend credit to or act as surety for other persons or entities in connection with the conduct of any active trade or business so long as the total exposure of the fund represented by such extensions of credit or suretyship arrangements when added to the aggregate borrowings of the fund does not exceed  of the value of the funds total net assets the shareholders also approved a fundamental policy designed to maintain the status of the fund as a diversified investment company by limiting the value of any trade or business to  or less of the funds total assets and limiting the gross profit therefrom to  or less of the funds total annual gross income investors should note that the fundamental policy changes do not restrict the types of active trades or businesses into which the fund can enter the revised borrowings policy allows the fund to arrange credit for the effective conduct of the operating business including the placement of orders for foreign manufactured products collateralized by letters of credit or similar documentary drafts the funds ability to extend credit to or act as surety for others affords the fund the opportunity to joint venture or otherwise participate in significant importing opportunities with other importers shareholders should be aware that joint ventures and participations should they arise will have risks inherent in them which may be different in character from normal business risks such as casualty breach of purchase contracts warranty claims and similar occurrences associated with any active trade or business engaged in the purchase sale delivery and redelivery of goods thus for example joint ventures or participations will carry with them the risks of nonperformance or inadequacy of the resources of joint venturer or participant in additiona joint venturer or participant in all likelihood will not be familiar with regulatory aspects of the funds business or its fundamental policies thereby requiring the fund to police carefully the activities of other ventures or participants to assure that activities or commitments binding upon the fund are not undertaken

the undertaking of any such ventures or participations which will ameliorate if not eliminate the additional risks to a degree sufficient to allow the fund to undertake appropriate joint ventures or participations with confidence that the risks inherent therein will be normal and customary and consistent with the funds fundamental policies the act and the continued achievement of the funds primary investment objectives if a joint venture is structured as a partnership the fund will not serve as a general partner and in serving as a limited partner will not assume liability which in managements view is unreasonable in light of the scope of the funds partnership interest in addition to the risks outlined above the funds operating business to the extent that it entails the importation of foreign products may be affected by unfavorable monetary exchange rates making foreign imports less competitive with domestic products and thus less attractive to american consumers without the funds entry into an operating business management believes that the fund may have been forced to make taxable distributions to its shareholders in contravention of its investment objectives in order to avoid or limit its potential accumulated earnings tax liability while there can be no assurance that the conduct of the operating business will either eliminate or minimize the

massachusetts   � � � october   � dear fellow shareholder this past quarter and in fact these past nine months have placed us in the top echelon of the growth and income category as defined by most performance measurement groups we do not profess to be in competition with other funds as our structure is geared to aftertax returns not pretax returns to shareholders keep in mind that copley does not distribute dividends on capital gains but pays its own taxes our studies have shown that a mean comparative average of performance between copley and other funds is approximately three percent ie if a fund has gained  and copley  the two funds are probably equal in aftertax return for the individual ex tax free accounts our investment philosophy of owning stocks with high dividends and histories of increases in dividends has enabled us in this volatile environment to continue to show net increases in net asset value this past quarter we showed a gain of  while most averages and funds lost  to  this result has been noted by many financial publications we believe this erosion of value will in the long run create a stronger stock market environment it will eliminate the weak of heart investors it will lower expectations of unreasonable growth and will create a healthier climate of sane investing however we still must weather the problems of asia russia south america and the exposure of banks to their losses in hedge funds and loans to the above area if banks do not have the liquidity to lend to business small business must suffer and in many cases go into bankruptcy as occurred in the real estate debacle of  when banks no longer had liquidity to lend money and good small businesses were forced to fail this could cause a significant though temporary downturn domino effect to the economy meanwhile copley continues its steady growth as evidenced by our long term record �  top performing fund in        � � � � calendar years  �         september   our operating division has added shoes for our distribution this has increased our volume for the six months to more than  with a concurrent increase in profits added to our net asset value we do look forward to continued steady increases even in this volatile market environment and wish to express our appreciation to our board of directors for their help and advice and to our shareholders for their confidence and understanding of copleys concept and structure � cordially yours s irving levine irving levine president � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �  copley fund inc per
