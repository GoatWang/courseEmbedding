francis crick maurice wilkins and rosalind franklin these four scientists—watson crick franklin and wilkins—codiscovered the doublehelix structure of dna which formed the basis for modern biotechnology   home  learn  historical biographies at king’s college london rosalind franklin obtained images of dna using xray crystallography an idea first broached by maurice wilkins franklin’s images allowed james watson and francis crick to create their famous twostrand or doublehelix model in  watson b  crick – and wilkins – jointly received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their  determination of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid dna wilkins’s colleague franklin – who died from cancer at the age of  was not so honored the reasons for her exclusion are unclear discovering the structure of dna the molecule that is the basis for heredity dna contains the patterns for constructing proteins in the body including the various enzymes a new understanding of heredity and hereditary disease was possible once it was determined that dna consists of two chains twisted around each other or double helixes of alternating phosphate and sugar groups and that the two chains are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of organic bases—adenine a with thymine t and guanine g with cytosine c modern biotechnology also has its basis in the structural knowledge of dna—in this case the scientist’s ability to modify the dna of host cells that will then produce a desired product for example insulin the background for the work of the four scientists was formed by several scientific breakthroughs the progress made by xray crystallographers in studying organic macromolecules the growing evidence supplied by geneticists that it was dna not protein in chromosomes that was responsible for heredity erwin chargaff’s experimental finding that there are equal numbers of a and t bases and of g and c bases in dna and linus pauling’s discovery that the molecules of some proteins have helical shapes—arrived at through the use of atomic models and a keen knowledge of the possible disposition of various atoms rosalindfranklinjpg rosalind franklin in paris courtesy vittorio luzzati rosalind franklin of the four dna researchers only rosalind franklin had any degrees in chemistry she was born into a prominent london banking family where all the children—girls and boys—were encouraged to develop their individual aptitudes she attended newnham college one of the women’s colleges at cambridge university she completed her degree in  in the middle of world war ii and undertook graduate work at cambridge with ronald norrish a future nobel laureate she resigned her research scholarship in just one year to contribute to the war effort at the british coal utilization research association there she performed fundamental investigations on the properties of coal and graphite she returned briefly to cambridge where she presented a dissertation based on this work and was granted a phd in physical chemistry after the war through a french friend she gained an appointment at the laboratoire centrale des services chimiques de l’etat in paris where she was introduced to the technique of xray crystallography see video on this page and rapidly became a respected authority in this field in  she returned to england to king’s college

understand structure of atoms maurice wilkins wilkinsjpg maurice wilkins with xray crystallographic equipment about  courtesy king’s college london and horace freeland judson already at work at king’s college was maurice wilkins a new zealand–born but cambridgeeducated physicist as a new phd he worked during world war ii on the improvement of cathoderay tube screens for use in radar and then was shipped out to the united states to work on the manhattan project like many other nuclear physicists he became disillusioned with his subject when it was applied to the creation of the atomic bomb he turned instead to biophysics working with his cambridge mentor john t randall—who had undergone a similar conversion—first at the university of st andrews in scotland and then at king’s college london it was wilkins’s idea to study dna by xray crystallographic techniques which he had already begun to implement when franklin was appointed by randall the relationship between wilkins and franklin was unfortunately a poor one and probably slowed their progress  james watson and francis crick meanwhile in  yearold james watson a chicagoborn american arrived at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge watson had two degrees in zoology a bachelor’s degree from the university of chicago and a doctorate from indiana university where he became interested in genetics he had worked under salvador e luria at indiana on bacteriophages the viruses that invade bacteria in order to reproduce—a topic for which luria received a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  watson went to denmark for postdoctoral work to continue studying viruses and to remedy his relative ignorance of chemistry at a conference in the spring of  at the zoological station at naples watson heard wilkins talk on the molecular structure of dna and saw his recent xray crystallographic photographs of dna he was hooked watsoncrickdnamodeljpg james watson and francis crick with their dna model at the cavendish laboratories in  to request permission to use this photo please visit the science photo library website at wwwphotoresearcherscom  a barrington brown watson soon moved to the cavendish laboratory where several important xray crystallographic projects were in progress under the leadership of william lawrence bragg max perutz was investigating hemoglobin and john kendrew was studying myoglobin a protein in muscle tissue that stores oxygen perutz and kendrew received the nobel prize in chemistry for their work in the same year that the prize was awarded to the dna researchers— working under perutz was francis crick who had earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from university college london and had helped develop radar and magnetic mines during world war ii crick another physicist in biology was supposed to be writing a dissertation on the xray crystallography of hemoglobin when watson arrived eager to recruit a colleague for work on dna inspired by pauling’s success in working with molecular models watson and crick rapidly put together several models of dna and attempted to incorporate all the evidence they could gather franklin’s excellent xray photographs to which they had gained access without her permission were critical to the correct solution the four scientists announced the structure of dna in articles that appeared together in the same issue of nature separate career paths then they moved off in different directions franklin went to birkbeck college london to work in j d bernal’s laboratory a much more congenial setting for her than king’s college before her untimely death from cancer she made important contributions to the xray crystallographic analysis of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus a landmark in the field by the end of her life she had become friends with francis crick and his wife and had moved her laboratory to cambridge where she undertook dangerous work on the poliovirus wilkins applied xray techniques to the structural determination of nerve cell membranes and of ribonucleic acid rna—a molecule that is associated with chemical synthesis in the living cell—while rising in rank and responsibility at king’s college watson’s subsequent career eventually took him to the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl of quantitative biology on long island new york where as director from  onward he led it to new heights as a center of research in molecular biology from  to  he headed the national center for human genome research at the national institutes of health afterward he returned to cshl from which he retired in  during crick’s long tenure at cambridge he made fundamental contributions to unlocking the genetic code he and sydney brenner demonstrated that each group of three adjacent bases on a single dna strand codes for one specific amino acid he also correctly hypothesized the existence of “transfer” rna which mediates between “messenger” rna and amino acids after  years at cambridge with several visiting professorships in the united states crick joined the salk institute for biological studies in la jolla california further recognition in  james watson was honored with the othmer gold medal from chf for his scientific talent which has given the world a new intellectual understanding of the nature of life making possible modern biotechnology and a better life for all mankind   visit the museum at
