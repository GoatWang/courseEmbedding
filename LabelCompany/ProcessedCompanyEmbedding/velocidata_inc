omalley why chris galvin loves startup velocidata the whiteboard beside chris omalleys desk next to drawings of jesus and ronald reagan includes the names of dozens of americas largest corporations it seems like a pieinthesky list of sales prospects considering that mr omalleys company velocidata inc has just six employees in its river north headquarters yet several of these giants including wellpoint inc and american express co already are customers each paying the startup 9 a month for its flagship dataprocessing product zfusion why because big companies can generate more than  billion data points per day and their own mainframes are illequipped to quickly translate those inputs into meaningful analysis velocidata targets a section of the bigdata continuum called extraction transformation and loading it brings data from disparate sources and formats them harmoniously so that analytics programs can parse them effectively indianapolisbased health insurer wellpoint inc required up to 6 hours to sync certain patient data across its network the problem partly was due to different systems used by its various blue cross  blue shield subsidiaries with zfusion the process takes less than a minute “im used to selling products that are maybe  percent or 0 percent better than what people are used to” says mr omalley  “im not used to this — something thats better by an order of magnitude” rifle shot mr omalley spent 2 years at software maker ca inc of islandia new york working his way up to ceo of one of its acquired companies nimsoft inc in 2 he left and joined velocidatas board he became velocidatas ceo last july just as velocidata announced the receipt of  million from three investors including former motorola inc ceo chris galvin“it took me  minutes to

university in st louis and first applied to highfrequency trading through st louisbased exegy inc velocidata spun out of exegy in  the core intellectual property was transferred to velocidata and exegy now essentially is a velocidata customer velocidatas person engineering team still is based in st louis but mr omalley moved its head office to chicago in november analysts are impressed by the companys technology“the thing that surprises me more than anything else isnt that velocidata has done this its that more people havent tried” says it industry analyst robin bloor founder of bloor research in london velocidata has little direct competition mr bloor says though ibm corps puredata product has similar underlying technology and could evolve into a competitor puredata is based on technology developed by netezza corp which armonk new yorkbased ibm purchased for 7 billion in  that means mr omalley might have to act fast but thats already velocidatas overall ethos speed after all
