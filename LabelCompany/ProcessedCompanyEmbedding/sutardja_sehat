semiconductors design sehat sutardja an engineering marvell open up today’s mobile electronic devices and you’ll likely see the imprint of sehat sutardja the beating heart of marvell by tekla s perry posted  oct    gmt advertisement photo gabriela hasbun look inside an ereader game console bluray player tv or smartphone and odds are you’ll find a cluster of chips designed by marvell technology group ltd a yearold silicon valley firm marvell crafts the cpu as well as the wireless transmitters and receivers the digital signal processors the video processors and even the power management system its chips will likely appear in the wave of android tablets expected to hit the market soon and the one laptop per child organization just announced that its next generation of lowcost computers—the first to finally get below us —will rely on marvell electronics as well but marvell and its quietly intense founder and ceo sehat sutardja aren’t exactly household names that doesn’t particularly bother sutardja if he’s looking for affirmation of his enormous success he need only consider the company’s explosive growth its lineup of innovative indemand products its more than  employees its rd and design centers in canada china france germany india israel italy japan the netherlands silicon valley south korea singapore spain switzerland and taiwan and its  billion in annual revenues if sutardja doesn’t capture media attention like say apple’s steve jobs well he’s okay with that but just as jobs sets the vision for apple sutardja pours his personality and passions into marvell and unlike jobs who was not the technological powerhouse of the two steves that founded apple sehat is an engineer to the core a genius at circuit design for whom electronics is not only a vocation but also his only recreation so far sutardja an ieee fellow and his marvell cofounders—his wife weili dai and his brother pantas sutardja—have successfully managed the business as well as the technology but in a sense it’s been an offbroadway production—it may be packing the house night after night but it hasn’t gotten a lot of media attention today however the company is trying to make the transition to a bigger stage and sutardja increasingly finds himself in the spotlight born in indonesia to chinese parents in  sutardja had a fairly ordinary childhood for his time and place “if it rains” he recalls “you go out and dance in the rain you see butterflies you chase the butterflies you see dragonflies you chase the dragonflies it was a simple life” and then he discovered engineering and his butterflychasing days were over it happened on a visit to singapore where his younger brother pantas was living with their grandparents sehat was in sixth grade pantas in fifth as boys will do sehat started poking through his brother’s possessions including some diy books and magazines geared toward electronics hobbyists he spotted a great project building a van de graaff generator he and pantas bought some copper wire at a surplus store and managed to rig together a crude but functional machine back in indonesia after vacation sehat couldn’t stop thinking about the generator he began constructing a miniature version that he could use to shock people as a prank scavenging gear from his parents’ auto parts store the device worked but its copper contact points oxidized so fast he had to sand them down every few minutes after a little research at the local bookstore he discovered that transistors could replace mechanical switches “okay” he remembers thinking “i’ll have to learn how to use transistors” sehat found a radio repair shop where he could do just that within a year he received his radio repair license a document he seems more proud of than his college diploma his wife carries it for him in her purse in case he wants to show it to people which he often does sehat continued to tinker with circuits and he also kept abreast of new developments in the field the most interesting news always seemed to be coming from the likes of fairchild national motorola and texas instruments his next step was obvious he had to go to the united states one of the few people he knew in the states was the brother of a friend who happened to be studying at the university of san francisco a private school so sehat applied there he arrived in the summer of  only to discover that the math and physics classes were repeats of what he’d already taken in high school the college didn’t even have an electrical engineering program he was crushed to learn photo gabriela hasbun family matters marvell’s founders are actually one happy family sehat sutardja center is the ceo his wife weili dai left and his brother pantas sutardja are also marvell executives the company reflects their passions for example the basketball court pictured above has special meaning for dai who played on an elite team as a child in shanghai another indonesian friend was enrolled at iowa state university which did have an engineering school sehat transferred and then spent the next two and a half years racing through the curriculum typically taking two extra classes each semester during the summers of  and  he worked for ibm in kingston ny by the time he graduated in  he knew a little more about us universities and applied to the university of california berkeley for a graduate program renowned in the analog circuit design community his brother pantas was also there working on his undergraduate ee degree sehat studied lowpower lowimpedance amplifiers as part of a research program targeting the integrated services digital network isdn which at the time was considered the next big thing in communications he moved on to designing analogtodigital converters for isdn phones again focusing on lowpower devices because these phones would be powered through the phone network not the electrical grid even as a grad student sehat made an impression says stephen lewis his office mate at berkeley and now a professor at the university of california davis “he’s a perfectionist for example when we were students we were building pipeline atod converters the traditional way of setting the gain of a switchedcapacitor amplifier to two used two capacitors one twice as big as the other he figured out a way to do it with two identical capacitors increasing the amplifier speed by increasing its feedback factor we had a solution that worked but he kept digging until he found a way to do it better” lewis recalls that sehat revised his layouts over and over trying to eliminate any errors that would prevent the capacitors from matching exactly these errors wouldn’t have caused the device to fail they would have only reduced the performance slightly still sehat wouldn’t let them go it’s that same doggedness and attention to detail lewis believes that makes sehat and his company so successful today outside the lab and the classroom sehat didn’t do much if it wasn’t related to engineering he wasn’t interested he managed to meet the woman who became his wife anyway one day sehat and a friend visiting from out of town were getting on the elevator in the electrical engineering and computer science building already in the elevator was an undergrad named weili dai sehat’s friend began chatting her up sehat said nothing embarrassed by his friend’s corny lines dai wasn’t terribly impressed either “there were two guys” she says “and one of the guys says ‘hi are you a computer science major’ i was like ‘wow this guy knows this building is computer science wow’” but she did remember the quiet guy and he remembered her enough to say hello when they ran into each other several weeks later after a few more encounters he invited her to study with him in his office neither liked bars so for them this was a perfect date by the time sehat got his phd in  the two were so serious that sehat was unwilling to consider jobs outside the bay area photo gabriela hasbun by design sehat sutardja runs marvell from a silicon valley campus that once housed com inside and out the buildings are gems of clean design with many of the furnishings selected according to feng shui principles he joined micro linear corp a fabless semiconductor company in san jose he worked on dtoa converters and other chips for disk drives but instead of using building blocks from the company’s design library as was expected he designed every circuit from scratch reducing the latency of the disk controller from  nanoseconds to just  his superiors doubted the designs would work though so sehat found himself lobbying for his approach all the way up to the vice president of engineering who eventually agreed to use the new circuits they worked and the controller ended up in hewlettpackard drives used by a wide variety of manufacturers looking for more challenges sehat joined integrated information technology in santa clara calif where he designed circuits for digital video compression and decompression the technology was novel but ended up in a dog of a product the att videophone it was time to move on but sehat didn’t know what to do next his wife did though “engineers always talk about technology” she says “they figure out a way to design something to make a product better” but sehat was a little different she says for he also thought about how the product would fare in the market when they were still in school she had told him “after your phd you get some realworld experience but whenever you’re ready we’re going to do a company of our own” in  he was ready he asked his brother pantas who had recently left ibm’s almaden research center to join the startup with some savings and money from dai’s parents on  february  the three incorporated marvell—so named because they were planning to do marvelous things and they had noticed a lot of successful companies’ names ended with “el” or “ell” like intel novell and nortel sehat already had plans for the first product a better read channel for disk drives it sounds incredibly specialized and it is but it’s also one of the drive’s key components the read channel takes the analog signal coming from the magnetic head as it scans the disk converts the noisy signal to digital and puts that information out onto the bus that will take it to the computer existing read channels used a bipolar transistor on a complementarymetaloxide semiconductor substrate bicmos but sehat planned to use only cmos that way the channels could be manufactured by a chip foundry like the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co so marvell wouldn’t have to build its own fab using cmos also meant that the device would consume less power this would however present an engineering challenge existing cmos readchannel designs were much slower than bicmos however pantas had worked on hard drive technology at ibm and sehat had experience in mixed signal chips—those that require combining analog and digital technology between them they thought they could design a read channel that could handle  megabits per second putting them well ahead of existing  mbs bicmos products and they projected equal to the next generation of bicmos chips that would be coming from the established companies the traditional method used in read channels involved looking for peaks in the analog waves to define the digital bits but as the bit density increased it got harder to distinguish the peaks the sutardja brothers instead took multiple samples of the signal and then used digital signal processing circuitry to sort them out this approach reduced noise and also sped up the bit rate “the marvell founders would come to conferences say they could do it in cmos but wouldn’t reveal their secret sauce” says stephan ohr an analyst with gartner who covered analog devices at the time “years later we found out that they simply threw more gates at the problem creating elaborate filtering circuits” the real breakthrough of this approach says ohr was that it was scalable—they could make faster and faster devices simply by following the cmos technology curve—and the approach could be transferred to other products pantas defined the architecture then moved on to simulate the digital circuitry sehat focused on the analog aspects of the design the brothers hired four engineers to help out by christmas  they had the first working chips “i’m a bit narrowminded i only see things in terms of electronics” —sehat sutardja marvell now had a product but no customers so dai dialed information and got the number of every disk drive manufacturer she could think of “fortunately” she says “in the storage market you only have about half a dozen guys” the company sent samples to three drive companies they all found the chip to be faster and cheaper and lower power—but sehat reports they were reluctant to bet on a startup eventually they convinced seagate technology to take a chance ken burns an executive at seagate told them that the company’s nextgeneration drive would need a read channel at  mbs—could marvell deliver pantas recalls that even though they had been designing to  the chip was already running at close to  they told burns yes in less than three months the marvell team hit the mbs mark and seagate became marvell’s first customer “that changed everything” pantas says marvell now had an easier time getting its next customers particularly in the japanese market says sehat “the japanese customers cared more about the technology instead of the perceived risk of dealing with a small company” today in terms of units sold marvell has about  percent of the market for hard drive systemsonachip “this little startup with one product line put texas instruments out of the readchannel business” ohr says marvell then turned its sights on the ethernet industry because as with the disk drive read channel ethernet chips extract analog signals from a noisy environment the company got a jump start in  by acquiring galileo technology a company that built controllers for data networking today marvell is the second largest supplier of ethernet transceivers and switches next came wifi most wifi products at that time were cards with an array of components but marvell again blew the competition away when it announced singlechip wifi in  the wifi market today brings in about  percent of marvell’s revenue these days marvell along with many of its competitors is building not just simple processors but what the industry refers to as platforms that is it puts together in one package most of the key electronic components for a device flint pulskamp an analyst with market research firm idc says designing platforms rather than single chips makes it easy for the customer and also presents a higher barrier to competition marvell now has platforms for smartphones including android devices wifi networking and ethernet communications its platforms are also in two of the three top game systems sony’s and microsoft’s and a number of ereaders including the original kindle earlier this year right after the company introduced a tablet reference design it calls moby for use in  tablet computers the one laptop per child association announced that it would use the moby design in its xo tablet next on marvell’s agenda led lighting which requires a surprising amount of control electronics just as sehat had done as a teenage tinkerer a grad student and a young circuit designer he’s continued to push marvell’s engineers to rethink conventional designs to get a leap in performance sehat’s berkeley office mate lewis believes that’s how the company gets the edge on its competition by making countless little things slightly better “you put enough of those things together and you have a product that is significantly better” lewis says if marvell’s ascent sounds like the plot of a disney musical keep in mind that every good story has its moment of crisis for the company that point came in  when the us securities and exchange commission accused the company of backdating stock option grants the same charge was made against a number of tech companies at that time jeff palmer vice president of investor relations for the company explains it this way “in the late ’s and  when there was a land rush to hire people potential employees asked for options at price points in the past there is nothing illegal about granting stock options below market rate the issue is if you don’t document them in your sec filings this happened at many many many companies we fought the charge because we believed that we had done nothing fundamentally wrong and none of the founders enriched themselves personally” however as chief operating officer dai was in the hot seat dealing with issues she wasn’t exactly comfortable with “i’m a software engineer” she says “i never even took a finance class finance legal all of those completely make a dark side” marvell eventually reached a settlement with the sec without admitting or denying the allegations it paid  million in fines and dai herself paid   in addition dai agreed to step down as chief operating officer she now holds the hazysounding position of cofounder vice president and general manager of communications and consumer business she says she is not allowed to talk about the case but points out that the change in title hasn’t changed what she does at the company which she calls being the “caretaker” of the big family inside marvell and its customers outside “an unfortunate tsunami hit” she says “but everybody knows who i am and what i do and so life goes on” today marvell has offices in  countries and its cofounders are billionaires yet at heart sehat is still an engineer and the corporate culture reflects that “we are an engineeringdriven company” sehat says “a nerdy company” dai says you see that in the hiring a vast majority have electrical engineering degrees—and not just those doing design work investor relations vice president palmer for instance holds a bsee from george washington university “it doesn’t mean that someone who doesn’t have an engineering degree could not be hired as a marketing person” says sehat “it’d just make it harder” sehat describes his management philosophy as a combination of two famous silicon valley styles the “only the paranoid survive” mantra of intel’s former ceo andrew grove and hewlettpackard’s “management by walking around” which encourages executives to interact more with their employees both styles come naturally to sehat “we’ve always been paranoid from day one when we started the company” he says “we always thought the other guys could beat us so we needed to build something even better” and his designers confirm that even now sehat won’t hesitate to roll up his sleeves and dive into the most difficult project he keeps up on the technical literature and every week conducts random reviews of projects in the design stage if his engineers tell him that a task will take two weeks “sehat will tell them it can be done in x number of hours or days” says gani jusuf an early employee and now a vice president “newcomers think he is trying to put pressure on them but he’s not it’s that he is four steps ahead of everybody in quickness and he can do it that fast” and says jusuf he “walks the walk he may tell an engineer in a design review to change a layout the designer will say ‘i can’t do that in time’ and sehat will go back to his office for a while then come out with the new layout and say ‘here you go’” lately though sehat finds himself being forced out of his ee comfort zone and moving onto a more visible stage “i never wanted to be involved in politics because i thought it was not productive for me or the company” he says but the economic and environmental impacts of the semiconductor technology he has worked so hard to advance have started to worry him “we can now build practically anything in a chip or two at low cost for less than the cost of maybe two cups of coffee” he says “and every one of these devices will consume energy in the next  years we’ll be building  billion  billion units of these new devices all consuming energy and we’ll be in trouble very very quickly” as part of an industry that is creating this energysucking monster he feels obligated to try and tame it “we don’t have  years to solve this problem” he says “we don’t even have  years” sehat is now a regular visitor to washington dc where he’s been pushing energy conservation standards for small consumer electronics devices marvell this year helped write the smart electronics act hr introduced by us representative michael honda a democrat who represents the silicon valley area the bill calls for the us department of energy and the environmental protection agency to draft testing protocols for such devices marvell is also working with the california governor’s office on a similar initiative for the state as you might expect sehat has already taken an exhaustive look at existing power supply technology and he doesn’t like what he sees the design hasn’t changed in decades he notes even though it’s now possible to build in circuitry that would keep the voltage in phase with the current and thereby improve efficiency “technology has advanced so drastically over the last  years that we can implement this function practically for free” he says of course he isn’t blind to the business opportunities marvell is busy developing circuitry for such improved power supplies sehat is also using his personal fortune to support technology education “with the support of higher education diminishing i’m afraid the united states will fall behind countries like china” he and dai have donated more than  million to berkeley to complete the new headquarters for the center for information technology research in the interest of society—otherwise known as sutardja dai hall their two sons now pass it daily as ee students there but his riches haven’t changed his lifestyle he and his wife carpool to the office most days admittedly in a mercedes sedan they don’t own a yacht or vacation home they eat most of their meals at work where the cafeteria usually offers a chinese meal along with more typical silicon valley fare they work until  or so and then drive home together typically talking shop in the evening sehat often relaxes by turning on the syfy channel which he half watches while sketching circuit designs or he might kick back with the latest ieee publication whether it’s ieee spectrum or the ieee journal of solidstate circuits and that is pretty much the extent of his leisure activities “i’m a bit narrowminded” he says “i only see things in terms of electronics” can that strict engineering approach continue to work for marvell it’s not the scrappy little startup anymore it is now a formidable company with shareholders to please and quarterly targets to meet for marvell to continue to grow says sergis mushell an analyst with gartner the time has come for it to lead he believes the company now needs to identify a killer app and open a new market on its own rather than focusing on incremental changes to existing products “that’s not an easy thing” he says “many companies get to this point and struggle” “having a ceo so involved on the engineering side” may make it tough for original ideas to percolate through the organization he adds but so far he says marvell is heading in the right direction the company with its platforms for tablet computers smartphones and ereaders is trying to create additional markets for mobile lowpower processors and while sehat and his cofounders could certainly afford to retire tomorrow marvell remains their singular passion says dai “this is just the beginning for us our mission is long term there’s so much we ought to do it’s a houraday job still” for sehat the need to keep creating semiconductorbased technology springs from something even more basic “i don’t know anything else” he says this article originally appeared in print as “marvell inside” advertisement recommended for you the turtlebot teacher bespoke processors

form k and is available on our website in the investor relations section with that i would now like to turn the call over to sehat sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer thanks john and good afternoon everyone id like to start todays call by thanking mike rashkin who is retiring as our cfo through his leadership mike has been extremely instrumental in improving financial discipline in the company all of us at marvell would like to thank mike for his many years of service and dedication to the company and wish him a wonderful retirement the board has also appointed our vp of finance and investor relations sukhi nagesh as interim cfo and many of you already know sukhi quite well and we expect this to be a smooth transition now moving on to the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal  we reported first quarter revenue of  million a sequential decline of  which was in line with our revised guidance the sequential decline was mainly due to softerthanexpected demand from the storage end market as well as from the emerging markets our nongaap gross margin of approximately  was better than our original guidance and we continue to effectively control our operating expenses which also came in better than our original guidance as a result our nongaap eps came in at  per share we believe the weaker demand in q was due to nearterm macroeconomic conditions as many of our customers and semiconductor peers experienced similar trends we expect this lower demand environment to persist in q but expect growth to resume in the second half of the year despite the nearterm headwinds we will continue to invest in new and innovative technologies as we believe this will allow marvell to emerge stronger when economic situations improves now i would like to provide a brief update on each of our end markets first on storage revenue declined  sequentially due to weaker than expected hdd sales and seasonally soft ssd demand in hdds our revenue declined on weaker than expected hdd tam during the quarter despite the weakness in hdds we believe we maintained our market share next in ssds q is a seasonally soft quarter and revenue declined sequentially as expected we continue to maintain our technology leadership and focus on developing industryleading solutions such as dramless nvme ssd products which we expect to do well in the market for q we expect our storage end market to decline sequentially on continued end market weaknesses at this point i would like to take a moment and discuss a breakthrough technology that we believe will significantly benefit the storage industry this technology is related to the flc technology that you have heard me talking about in the last few months for those of you who have not heard about it flc stands for finallevel cache a technology that developed to solve the main memory problem in computer systems it is a big data caching technology and today i want to talk to you about the adoption of flc into storage devices more specifically using flc we will now be able to make an hdd perform like an ssd why is this important the hdd industry is at a critical stage where it is dealing with the competitive forces at play from ssds especially at the mid and highend of the market the hdd industry knows that the best way to deal with the competitive threat of ssds is to adopt hybrid drive technology unfortunately firstgeneration hybrid drives do not adequately address the ssd challenge headon and as a result market acceptance has been lukewarm more specifically the performance of these early hybrids is closer to hdds rather than to ssds this is because the ssd caching algorithm that is used on the early generations on the firstgeneration hybrid has the hit rate of only approximately  in other words these early hybrid devices behave more like an ssd – more like – behave like an ssd half of the time and behave like an hdd the other half of the time the problem is in mobile applications the user expects the storage device to be asleep when not in use this unfortunately creates sluggishness whenever the drive needs to be awakened during that  of the time this latency time is clearly noticeable to the user and therefore user experience is poor we have now solved this problem by using the breakthrough flc technology using flc every hybrid drive will soon be able to behave like an ssd about  of the time basically practically for practical purposes  of the time so as far as the user is concerned the hybrid is now practically an ssd using this technology we can now build a  terabyte consumer hybrid drive with flc cache for only  of bill of material compared to a  terabyte ssd which would otherwise cost  of bill of material similarly a fourterabyte enterprise hybrid drive with a gigabyte flc cache could soon be built with approximately  of bill of material versus a pure terabyte enterprise ssds which today would easily cost upward of  times or more so as you can see it is not a matter of if but a matter of when the hdd industry adopts our flc technology to power all of their hard drives we have engineering samples now and we are actively promoting our flcbased hybrid technology to our customers we expect first production to our customers early next year now next for our mobile and wireless end market q is typically a slower period specifically in q we saw weaker than normal demand last quarter due to the overall slowdown in chinas smartphone build as a result our mobile and wireless revenue declined  sequentially in mobile china unicom recently launched the worlds first rmb lte smartphone using our bit quadcore  mobile platform the same mobile platform used by china mobile for their tdlte devices the same bit lte platform has also started shipping into global markets with tier  customers such as samsung additionally our turnkey program is on track to launch at the end of q this will expedite our partners adoption of our chipset and allow them to go to market sooner moving to connectivity revenue was slightly below expectations primarily due to weaker mobile shipments in china and seasonality in gaming consoles for connectivity early this year weve announced the industrys highest performance x ac wave product and have seen broad market interest in adopting wave products this year wave provides multiple simultaneous data links of the wifi and increases network capacity for densely populated environment thus extending wireless capabilities to a variety of new use cases such as realtime video streamings to multiple devices wave is the future of wifi and is the next growth driver in wireless connectivity we will be announcing additional wave products over the coming months as we refresh our key connectivity products to support the wave ecosystem to address all tiers of the market in the meantime our existing mainstream ac products continue to gain adoption at multiple customers for example recently linksys announced another flagship x ac router now moving the mobile computing space we are shipping our industryleading x ac combo into mobile applications running windows as well as chrome os we expect to see mobile computing products on the shelf using our wifi solutions later this year moving next to iot we continue to gain design wins for our connectivity and microcontroller solutions for iot platforms at multiple tier  oems for example xiaomi has recently – already announced a series of smart home products powered by marvells wireless microcontroller iot platforms over the next decade it is estimated that billions of iot products will be used by consumers and businesses for this to happen we believe there will be a fundamental change in how these products engineered to allow them to realize their full potential of being always connected historically the vast majority of embedded devices have used simple bit and at most bit microcontrollers running rudimentary software and often with no operating system at all in order for these products to fully participate in the internet products will need to incorporate much more sophisticated software which will require more powerful bit microprocessors the enduser expectations of connected products creates a requirement for significantly more sophisticated software which calls for building embedded software in a new way were addressing the software challenge with kinomajs an application framework uniquely designed to address the application software needs for the iot by providing embedded programmers with a modern highlevel scripting language javascript to power their products today javascript powers or repowers the web pages mobile applications and web service as one of the most popular and productive computer languages we believe it is poised to power embedded products thereby accelerating the growth of the iot we recently released our kinomajs software under an open source license to encourage customer adoption using kinomajs marvells customers can create highperformance products across a wide variety of hardware platforms using common code across multiple chipsets thus removing the barrier to adoptions and increasing scalability of their designs moving next to our multimedia business in q we launched our nextgeneration multimedia socs the armada  ultra which features a quadcore arm cpu core gpus carrierclass security and stateoftheart power management this product is designed to enable paytv operators and settop box manufacturers to costeffectively migrate all of their customers to k video capability as you know k is the future of video for q we expect our mobile and wireless end market to be flat to up slightly turning next to networking demand came in weaker than expected and revenues declined  sequentially mainly driven by muted enterprise networking demand however we continue to make progress in design wins with our networking socs in areas such as network storage interconnect applications and we are gaining share at telecommunications and access infrastructure customers in addition we have secured more customers for our gbaset which is our gigabit ethernet copper phy solution last year gbaset deployment doubled compared to the year earlier to a total of  million ports over  million ports are predicted for this year by some analysts every major switch oem has introduced a gbaset interface option and we are the leading supplier for the gbaset solutions for q we are expecting our networking business to be flat sequentially on continued muted enterprise spending in summary despite the nearterm market uncertainty we continue to focus on execution and believe we are well positioned to return to growth in the second half of the year in addition we believe this year will be an exciting transition period for marvell as we incorporate flc technology in many areas including storage as i mentioned earlier on top of this major drive of implementing flc we are also implementing mochi our new modular chip technology into all of our products and solutions once our mochi technology is fully deployed we will be able to drastically lower product development costs and improve timetomarket more importantly mochi will allow our customers to develop new products that we havent even anticipated yet since they will be able to create virtual systemonachip to their liking using any combinations of our mochi devices i will speak about our progress in mochi and flc in the months to come so stay tuned and with that i would like to turn the call over to sukhi to go over our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thank you sehat and good afternoon everyone id also like to add my thanks to mike and congratulate him on his retirement mike has been a great mentor to me and i hope to operate with the same level of integrity and principles in my new role going forward moving to our financials as sehat mentioned our first quarter financial results reflected a muted demand environment which is consistent with many of our customers and semiconductor peers while revenues were in line with our revised guidance gross margin was slightly better than our original expectation mainly due to mix we reported revenues of  million for the first quarter which was a decline of  driven by softer demand trends across most end markets as sehat said earlier we believe the demand weakness is temporary and we expect to return to growth in the second half of this year moving to the details on our various end markets our storage revenue in the first quarter declined  sequentially and represented  of total revenue hdd sales were lower due to the welldocumented weakness in the pc value chain while ssds declined in line with seasonality our mobile and wireless revenue declined  from q and represented  of total revenue weaker lte smartphone demand in china was partially offset by initial shipments into a korean oems global smartphone platform connectivity sales were also weaker due to lower mobile and gaming seasonality in networking our q revenue was softer declining  sequentially and making up  of total revenue this was mainly due to muted demand from enterprise customers moving next to margins and expenses our nongaap gross margin for first quarter was approximately  or roughly flat from q but better than anticipated due to favorable mix nongaap operating expenses came in at  million better than expected due to continued operating discipline across all of our businesses this resulted in a nongaap operating margin of  for the quarter net interest and other income was about  million and we recognized a nongaap tax expense of  million in the quarter this resulted in nongaap net income for the first quarter of  million or  per diluted share the shares used to compute diluted nongaap eps during the first quarter were  million cash flow from operations for the first quarter was  million and free cash flow was  million or approximately  of sales now summarizing q results on a gaap basis we generated gaap net income of  million or  per diluted share the difference between gaap and nongaap results during the first quarter was mainly due to stockbased compensation expense of  million and approximately  million related to amortization and writeoff of intangible assets legal restructuring and a onetime cash compensation payment now turning to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of the end of the first quarter was approximately  billion a decrease of about  million from the previous quarter we used  million to buyback roughly  million shares of stock during the quarter we currently still have  million remaining in our authorized repurchase program and we will continue to be opportunistic in our buyback we also paid dividends of  million in the quarter or equivalent to  per share net inventory at the end of the first quarter was approximately  million an increase of  million from the previous quarter in anticipation of new customer programs that are launching over the next few quarters moving next to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  we currently project revenues to be in the range of  million to  million at the midpoint this would equate to roughly flat to q we expect storage business to decline sequentially our mobile and wireless business to be flat to up slightly and our network business to be flat to q we currently project nongaap gross margin of  plus or minus  basis points and anticipate nongaap operating expenses to be approximately  million plus or minus  million we anticipate rd expenses of approximately  million and sga expenses of approximately  million at the midpoint of our projected guidance this should translate to a nongaap operating margin of about  plus or minus  basis points the combination of interest and other income should net out to approximately  million and we expect tax expense to be approximately  million we currently expect diluted share count to be approximately  million shares in total we currently project nongaap eps to be  per diluted share plus or minus  on the balance sheet we currently expect to generate about  million in free cash flow during the quarter we anticipate our cash balance to be about  billion excluding any ma activity share buyback or other onetime items we currently expect our gaap eps to be lower than our nongaap eps by about  per share with that i would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the qa portion of our call derek questionandanswer session operator and our first question will come from the line of harlan sur jpmorgan harlan l sur  jpmorgan securities llc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question hdd industry shipment tam was down about   sequentially in q i think your hdd controller business was probably down more like  sequentially in the first quarter here in q i think hdd industry tam is looking to be down about kind of  to  and now youre guiding your hdd segment probably down in about that range as well so the marvell team is essentially undershipping consumption by  to  for two quarters in a row it seems like your customers are planning for some positive seasonality in q if that plays out should we anticipate a return to growth in your hdd business that is greater than the tam growth and – just given how much youre undershipping consumption here these past two quarters sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer harlan this is sukhi you bring up a good point but i think in our storage business overall weve never broken down the mix between hard drives and ssds and all we can say is our ssd business was down more than hdd business in the quarter for a myriad of different reasons i think which is pretty well aware so people know about that in the market but in terms of the hard drive business for us versus the tam we have some customers who are actually seeing a pullback in their business and we just believe that our tam over a multiple quarter period tracks that of the overall tam – our business tracks that of the overall tam its very hard for us to synchronize exactly every quarter but i think over a couple of quarter periods we are pretty similar to what the tam is sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer okay but you did brought up a good point that the hard drive – i mean the pc industry is – people in the pc industrys value chain are expecting to see the deployments of windows  over the second half of this year so as a result that is widely known that – by this time its widely known that theres a slowdown in the pc space due to that anticipation so well see i think we do expect when windows  sets its launch and have good reception we all get the benefits from that uptick harlan l sur  jpmorgan securities llc great sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer so harlan if there is an uptick in the drive industry for q or q and maybe we will see that benefit but at this point its probably too early for us to comment on that harlan l sur  jpmorgan securities llc okay thats a fair point and then a question for sehat so last call when i asked you said youd clearly be doing whats right for shareholders in terms of strategic options for mobile it seems like the pricing environment hasnt been getting any better the competitive environment continues to be fierce if you exit – and so and i – if you exit mobile i think youre left with a business that can grow kind of low midsingledigits top line and sort of being – throwing off sort of low mid operating margins and free cash flow margins so given that your mobile business was down in q and thats the fourth consecutive quarter are you any closer or is the team any closer to making any sort of strategic decision with mobile sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer oh well thats a good question as you know especially with the deployments from flcs and mochis technology into all our product lines we will be even more competitive in the mobile space so we – as a company we have to focus on developing the best technology to differentiate ourselves so mobile is no different however as we said earlier we have to be responsible also for the shareholders interest so well continue to be open to any strategic opportunities that come in front of us in the meantime we will continue to build even better even more advanced technology to make it even more attractive for our customers to use our products harlan l sur  jpmorgan securities llc thanks sehat sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thank you harlan operator your next question will come from the line of tim arcuri cowen  co tim m arcuri  cowen  co llc thank you very much i guess my first question is sukhi maybe you can talk about the cfo transition why did this happen now and maybe from a top level sehat maybe you can sort of address whether or not the cfo transition might change how you think about any of the possible strategic decisions you might make with the mobile and wireless business thanks sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer so ill answer the second part its none at all not even a bit sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer yeah there was no – theres no linkage to that at all tim and as far as the transition now mikes been with the company for  years hes been a fantastic leader for all of us and a great colleague for many people here whove been here and it was a personal decision for him to retire and so there was nothing more to that than that tim m arcuri  cowen  co llc okay then i guess for me im just wondering how you might handicap if i look at your ssd business it looks like its down more than i would expect unless there was a decision by one of the large notebook manufacturers to maybe begin to use their own controller they recently did buy a controller company several years ago and it looks like they might be doing that in a – in their flagship notebook now using their own part so my question is how does that impact your business and how do you handicap the likelihood that that customer or any other customer might use their own controller over yours thanks sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer sukhi do you want to answer that sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer sure yeah so tim i think youre probably on the right track in some of your assessment there but we also have very strong portfolio of products in ssds sehat mentioned about nvme dramless nvme ssd products and the pciebased products especially is going to be very critical for this market moving forward and we are engaged in with multiple other customers for this piece of a product as well so we do believe that the ssd market is growing and even if there are certain nearterm product transitions at a certain customer we should be able to move beyond that fairly quickly sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i want to add on top of that theres always going to be a customer that might want to use their own solution especially a customer that have a critical mass however the vast majority of the customers do not have such critical mass and they will still use thirdparty suppliers like from us and as far as from the ssd discussion its also – in terms of our differentiation how do we going to differentiate ourselves in the long run compared against the competition and the answer will be similar to the hdd space i said earlier we are now deploying a hybrid technology into our hdd portfolios so to make our hdd solution to be very very powerful just like as powerful as an ssd solutions it will help increase the adoptions of hdds into the market to reverse the trend of converting the hdd to ssds now at the same time using the same technology we can also build an enterprise ssd they have the cost of more like an hdd so this technology is applicable for hdd as well as for ssds so we believe that when the dust settles we will have the majority of the market share in this area tim m arcuri  cowen  co llc okay sehat thank you sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thank you tim operator your next question will be from the line of quinn bolton needham  company quinn bolton  needham  company llc hi sehat and sukhi i just wanted to follow up on harlans question obviously you guys undershipping the tam here in the nearterm can you make any comments as to whether youre seeing your hdd customers holding lower inventory levels and if so do you think thats a permanent reflection of just greater supply chain efficiencies or to the extent that demand conditions come back as harlan suggested maybe allows for a snapback in the second half of the year sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer its a good question quinn and thats entirely possible we do know that some customers do very tightly manage their inventory and did manage their inventory in q and their supply and their production towards the end of q how long that continues or if theyre going to switch it back on we dont have entire visibility into that at this point in time but if they do start to switch that back on we may see a positive benefit quinn bolton  needham  company llc okay and then just a follow on question on the flc technology obviously it sounds like it probably adds some kind of price premium over a standard hdd controller but can you give us any sense as flc starts to ship next year what you think the penetration might be and how – to the extent that that technology is accepted how much faster on a revenue basis could you grow rather than the overall hdd tam sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer yes for flc the cost adder – the silicon cost adder of deploying flc into the chip is actually quite insignificant especially if were talking about the storage market this technology – weve been developing this technology over close to three years and over the years we have improved the – we have mastered the implementation of this technology to the point where this is becoming very lowcost so we do believe because of the delta difference between the hybrid solution is so small basically practically just an addition of a singledevice flash chip to the hard drive once this thing is proven into the field the adoption rate will be very rapid there will be nobody in the world that wants to buy a standard hard drive once they see the significant improvement in the iops and response times of these flcbased hybrid drives so as i said earlier its not a matter of if it is just when and that time is just really its just a schedule of the time to port the softwares into these new device their certifications validations their certification of device and showing to their customers and thats typically in the order of about nine months or so nine months maybe at most  months so that will be the timing that we anticipate and after that i think everybody will want to demand flc hybrids technology weili dai  president yeah – yeah in addition to what sehat said flc technology benefits storage we are seeing the last few months its really across different markets for example mobile theres a huge hurdle everybody knows the battery the power is a big issue flc absolutely is going to be solving this issue as well as the cost the memory cost for the platform so we believe our flc technology is going to help companies differentiate in multiple markets so therefore well gain more business and new design wins sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer sorry to interrupt you so do you want to say something sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer quinn do you have a followup quinn bolton  needham  company llc oh i just had a quick follow up it was flc versus the firstgeneration hybrid drives does it use the same size flash chip or do you need a significantly larger flash chip to implement the flc sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer very good questions for the same size of flash chips the improvement in the hit rate from  to  actually during benchmark its actually  were saying  because its hard to believe that we could achieve a  hit rate so just to give an idea that there will be once in a while occasion where the algorithm will miss and we will have to access the hdd but that event is so rare with our flc technology versus the traditional caching algorithm about  sometimes less sometimes slightly less sometimes slightly better if it hits the ssds but the other  of the time it hits the hdd so – but during that time typically the hard drive is sleeping so then during that  of time it has to go to the hdd the drive has to spin up first it takes about  second and the data will be accessed then you have to put it down to sleep again and then the next access – if the next access happened to be in ssds youre fine but if next access goes to hdd again then youll have to wake the hdd again in our case we –  of the time its ssds so highly unlikely that the hdds – if its not on the hdd it takes one second then anybody will notice it because thats just a very rare event sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer its the same size footprint sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer oh for the same flash size so if its gigabytes no problem we can still use gigabytes a gigabytes no problem we can still use gigabytes now of course nobodys building gigabytes and gigabytes flash chips any longer so the smallest flash chip that we can buy is gigabytes but we have run a lot of benchmarks a lot of simulations that whether its gigabytes or gigabytes the performance is exactly the same well gigabytes is slightly better but for practical purposes its the same performance quinn bolton  needham  company llc great thanks for that clarification sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thank you quinn operator your next question will be from the line of sanjay chaurasia nomura sanjay chaurasia  nomura securities international inc hey sehat another question on flc there are multiple reasons ssd is being adopted in computing platforms a couple of things better power consumption by three times to four times lower weight by  times and ssds enabling thinner form factor such as ultrathin notebooks so even if flc allows you to bridge the gap in the performance versus ssds how much of the competitive dynamics you think you could change that could slow the decline in hard disk drives sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer well the – if you look in the laptops the laptop markets the difference between the laptops with the hard drive versus a flash the difference in the weight is quite insignificant so the biggest challenge of hdd in mobile laptop applications especially at the highend where people are willing to pay  or more for their laptops its really this instant on this practically – microsecond or millisecond latency that people expect from the ssd with our flc there is no way hdd could be put into sleep mode and be able to wake up in time for people to not to notice it so the market acceptance we expect the market acceptance of the hybrid drives to be very very good now in terms of the weight of the hdd today the thinnest hard drives in the world are millimeters well the vast majority that people are selling right now is actually to be millimeter hard drives we have been working with our partners to develop millimeter extremely thin thinner than a battery like extremely thin hard drive which is going to be full hybrid drive and if you look at it if you see the sample of the prototypes that we have on hand it is – i mean it is so beautiful its so light so you wouldnt have to notice any difference by the time you get into the laptop sanjay chaurasia  nomura securities international inc okay this is very helpful another question on mobile last quarter you indicated that your turnkey solution will be available by end of q and i believe i heard correctly you said q this time just wondering what was the delay and if you could provide some progress in that area and a part b in that question is do you see your mobile and wireless growing yearonyear in fiscal  sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer yes so if you look at the – responding to the first question the turnkey so the turnkey is progressing its a lot of – actually a lot of work needs to be done building the prototypes when i look at the prototypes i say i could understand why it is a little bit longer its very complicated and you have to build it nicer so if it doesnt look nice nobody wants it right so you need to get all the software running validated certified so a lot of certification work has been going on with the carrier especially with china mobile we have to buy new equipment test equipment a lot more test equipment to get the certification process going on with china mobile so those things have been progressing quite well so the delay is just minor compared to the amount of work that has to be done now in terms of the second question so the volumes we do expect that volumes will continue to grow so in the second half of this year we will be introducing our flcbased cell phones – smartphone chip that will be – well itll be the one that will be like a – itll be like a huge hit because for the very first time in the history of mankind there will be – anybody will be able to build a phone with such a small amount of main memory while behaving like a very highend phone so we can be able to compete with flagship phones that have gigabytes of main memory with fractions of the main memory so that is going to be the defining time of our success into this business weili dai  president yeah so in addition to what sehat said the china mobile – as you guys know that the china unicom marvell also is the leading providers in driving massmarket lte phones so theres a lot of effort there and we have multiple oems are coming out with their phones in the next few quarters as well sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer right and more specifically there sanjay i think for – we think q was probably the bottom for our mobile and we should probably start to see an improvement from unit and revenue going forward this particular quarter itself i think we should see a doubledigit growth in unit volume and for our lte business across both in china and in korea okay thank you sanjay chaurasia  nomura securities international inc thanks sukhi operator your next question will be from the line of chris caso susquehanna christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp hi thank you with respect to your revenue it looks like the first half is running on the order of about down  yearonyear could you characterize how much of that youd consider to be more due to what id say are persistent factors things like pricing and market share as compared to transient factors just the industry conditions and perhaps whats happening with inventory and i guess your answer to that probably gives some insight into your level of conviction for growth in the second half sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer well sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer yeah – go ahead sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer as we said earlier the two factors that you just mentioned are the ones that are really the biggest factors the transients – there are people waiting for their windows  introduction so people are not buying replacements for pcs i mean whatnot there is reduction in people buying but i think theyre more people waiting for the windows  and the other part was the slowdown in the smartphone shipments in china i mean which was apparently was already been quite wellknown in the last few months as you see the pricing of mobile dram has dropped quite a bit over the last few months so only just like the last few days that people have been talking about that sometimes or sometimes next month or so it is expected that the dram price – the dram pricing will go back up to be above  for gigabits for the mobile drams for the smartphones and because people expect that the smartphones shipments to pick up again in the second half so we do believe that the market will pick up again as well as our continued tractions in the customer space in the customer side on our mobile solution we do expect we will get bigger shipments now our customers also were getting on some new customers even with todays solutions while they are waiting for our flcbased technology because as soon as they see the significant advantage theyre going to have from our future flcbased smartphones they actually immediately could jump in and make decisions for people to have a new software solution quickly actually they start working on our kind of solution because they know that once they are familiar with our solution they could easily make benefits of their nextgeneration solution which is going to be significantly lower cost lower power much lower power and much longer battery standby time so so we are very bullish on this christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp okay well my follow up question is regarding the flc technology as well and a lots been said on that already but would you also potentially see licensing opportunities there in either businesses adjacent to what you do or perhaps totally different is that something you guys would entertain sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer i publish the flc technology because i know this will benefit mankind so im open to licensing the technology to anybody in the world its good for the world its good for us as well so christopher caso  susquehanna financial group lllp great thank you sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thats something definitely we will be considering chris thank you operator your next question will be from the line of hans mosesmann raymond james hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc thank you sehat just another one on flc so youre basically incorporating a dram and a lowcost ssd the dram who provides that or all vendors suppliers capable of supplying that sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer yes for the very first generation were using standard offtheshelf dram however the true benefits of flc will come whenever drams – if future drams are built differently more specifically future drams will be built – again if you look at my presentation at the isscc future drams should be built for performance latency lower power in mind than for increased capacity so those things are – if you look at the jedec in jedec – jedec is the industrywide organizations for memory – if you look at jedec a lot of proposals in the new memory architecture that have been shown in the last few months those exactly follow our proposal for modifying dram to be truly truly truly optimized to get the maximum benefit from flc but for now we use standard drams hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay and then as a follow up what is the incremental dollars to marvell from a conventional approach or a hybrid today to going to the firstgeneration flc is it   of your existing silicon sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer we dont want to talk about that its too early to talk about that sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer yeah too early sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer way too early to talk about that its more important that our customers at this point – our customer actually never even ask that questions so because they know that the benefits will way outweigh whatever the cost is to be – they have to incur to use this technology the benefits not just the money they will save from the less dram they have to buy the money – theyre saving also less battery smaller battery lighter lighter phones lighter mobile devices or they can use the same battery and have much longer battery life as i mentioned in my speech at the isscc we can now build – down the road using this technology we can build a smart watch with weeks of standby time so thats beyond how much money wed save to build this device its like even you want to spend all the money in the world you cannot do it anywhere today because your battery life is so bad so the other benefits there is not – its hard to measure from dollar point of view hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you operator your next question will be from the line of craig ellis b riley craig a ellis  b riley  co llc thanks for taking the question and congrats sukhi ill just follow up with the recent line of inquiry on flc sehat you already have a very strong share position in your core storage market but you said flc would be much more broadly applicable where do you think that technology would be most meaningful in terms of helping marvell gain share which applications is it mobile and within mobile would it be equally for smartphone and tablet or would it be in other applications sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer the answer is across the board the benefits in the mobile laptop applications is clear it just make things like really really low powered so the drive is sleeping  of the is purely sleeping consuming zero power so the benefit is very obvious but the nonsoobvious one would be the enterprise imagine if you have – if we have a lets say a petabyte of hard drive with a terabyte of flc cache a terabyte of flc cache – caching – well maybe lets not talk about petabyte – like  terabytes or  terabytes or  terabytes of hard drive the performance of their solutions will be incredible it will be – you will notice zero difference between a  terabyte of ssd pure ssd versus a  terabyte hard drive that has a  terabyte of ssd in fact you would notice the difference in power because now the power dissipations of the ssd will be onetenth compared to a pure  terabytes of ssd so – while its costing basically a tenth of the cost so the benefit is – the optimization the target optimization the benefit it is the same so for the highend we just have to have highcapacity flc cache for the individual users like the consumers which is we could afford – we could actually live with smaller cache and everybody will see the same benefit craig a ellis  b riley  co llc got it thank you and then the follow up is for you sukhi and more towards the middle of the income statement in the revenue outlook not much change pretty flattish but there is a much more meaningful change in gross margin is that just intersegment mix and with opex now at the  million level is that a level thats sustainable or as the business grows as the company is signaling later this year is that going to move back up sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer good question craig so on the gross margin front it is a function of mix obviously so i think if you look at the end markets guidance across the three different areas that should give you a fairly good explanation of why our guidance for gross margin is where it is for q as far as the opex even at  million we are constantly looking at ways of improving ourselves reducing our spending be more efficient and the answer really – the answer is no you shouldnt see our opex going back up in the second half of this year craig a ellis  b riley  co llc thanks guys operator and we have time for one final question and that question will be from the line of ian ing mkm partners ian l ing  mkm partners llc yes thanks a clarification on mobile and wireless it looks like guiding flat to up slightly doubledigit growth in unit volumes does that mean the asp declines are more benign than in recent quarters and then how would you say octacore pricing is based on some decacore announcements recently from competitors thanks sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer yeah so ian as you know in the mobile space pricing is always competitive we wont be sure what pricing is going to do in any given quarter we do have a connectivity business as well as a mobile business so we do expect to see growth in our mobile business in this quarter from multiple customers and maybe on the connectivity side maybe less growth if you will or a flattish outlook so – and its probably not appropriate for us to comment on pricing per se and we did notice some of our competitors talking about decacore were not entirely sure what – how the market will adapt decacore sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer well pricings always an issue we all in this industry building similar stuff so the beauty about flc is that once its deployed pricing will be a lot less of an issue because its not going to be about the cost of the chip any longer its the cost of the system that matters all of a sudden ian l ing  mkm partners llc okay well look for flc and then just a quick follow up over to mochi this modular development of silicon are you going to implement this as buildtoorder parts for customers or could you incorporate this into your standard assp products it seems that you connect up from smaller silicon die you can get a cheaper solution than a big monolithic die sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer right so – like i say it as i mentioned in my primary speaking as well as todays earning calls statement we were building basically anything thats reasonably – anything that we build – i mean almost anything that makes sense anything – almost anything that makes sense to be built using mochi interfaces so meaning like practically almost every application processors will have mochi interfaces so we are also building mochi southbridge devices many different kinds so we are – our engineers are busy building different types of this southbridge device functions so that our customers – once we are done with this our customers do not have to specify what chips need to be built all they have to buy – basically its like an à la carte menu they will take different application processors different southbridge functions different modems and they can build whatever they want and they can decide how much money they want to spend how much of a functionality they want to have it is all under their control they dont need certain functions they can save money automatically by not buying those functionalities so this is going to be – this is going to be so helpful for us it will improve our decisionmaking process we will improve timetomarket it will get things done sooner because chips are going be a lot simpler from now on ian l ing  mkm partners llc thank you sehat john ahn  director of investor relations marvell technology group ltd great all right i think thats it id like to thank everyone for their time today and the continued interest in marvell we look forward to speaking with you in the coming months thank you and goodbye sukhi nagesh  interim chief financial officer thank you weili dai  president thank you sehat sutardja  chairman  chief executive officer all right
