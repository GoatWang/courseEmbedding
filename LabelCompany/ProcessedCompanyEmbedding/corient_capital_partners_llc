that their goals can come to fruition permanent wealth the secret to permanent wealth lies in an understanding of the power of investment assets no other strategy no matter how sophisticated does more to maintain and grow wealth than the ownership of investment assets research suggests that the wealthiest onepercent of us households put threefourths of their savings into investment assets as a result those assets generate interest that can be compounded and dividends and capital gains that can be reinvested these attributes create a profound competitive advantage in sustaining wealth asset allocation  smart diversification the advantages of a thoughtful wellexecuted asset allocation cannot be overemphasized as research confirms that asset allocation is overwhelmingly the primary driver of portfolio performance research also reveals that the wealthiest onepercent of us households achieve an annual rate of return that is approximately  higher than the returns of households in the middle three quintiles this outperformance is explained by a more effective overall asset allocation and equally important a more effective selection of the diversified investments within that asset allocation by carefully selecting diversified investments based on their correlations to each other investors can achieve a greater return with less risk wealthy investors benefit the most from such smart diversification as they have an information advantage when it comes to tax efficient cost efficient investment strategies they also have access to value added strategies in asset classes like private equity and real estate corients dynamic approach based on timetested academic and quantitative research corient capital partners has developed a dynamic approach to smart diversification our proprietary process combines the best features of indexed investments active managers and value added strategies the dynamic approach to smart diversification is customized to each client and includes an active rebalancing of the ratio of indexed investments active managers and value added strategies portfolio construction is largely driven by the following conditions investment goals risk profile
