banking trust services financial planning investment management estate and legacy planning foundation supportand insurance services to our clients all under one roof and all under the fiduciary standard of care is a path not often traveled  but we prefer it this way  at first foundation we’ve never taken the easy path but we’ve always chosen the right one – for our clients our families our communities and each other in  we created first foundation but our story dates back to  when rick keller and his team at the keller group were providing wealth management services to individuals and businesses in orange county  the keller group was one of the nation’s first wealth management firms to align their success with their clients not just in how they invested but in how they were compensated for the work they did in industry parlance this is referred to as ‘feeonly’ and ‘operating under the fiduciary standard’  for the keller group it was just how business was done as the needs of clients became more complex rick sought additional support to offer his clients true comprehensive wealth management  in  rick and i along with the support of many created first foundation inc and added the capabilities of a bank to the existing investment management and financial planning platform we would later add trust services legacy planning consulting and insurance services this was to be the core offering of our platform and delivered in way that maintained a relentless focus on client service  i like to say that we have the capabilities of a multidiversified financial
