forces that drive it lets examine three charts that sum up micron technology and its longterm share price dynamics image source micron technology  micron technologys sales perhaps the most important thing to understand when looking at micron is that the dram and flash memory chips it sells are effectively commodity products market spot prices control what they can charge which means that microns revenue is almost entirely dependent on the current supplyanddemand dynamic for both types of memory chips this can lead to the same sort of tremendous topline fluctuations that are experienced by oil producers or other commoditybased businesses as you can see from microns historical revenue chart mu revenue ttm data by ycharts as you can see the general direction of microns sales has been upward as technology and computing power have become more integral parts of our everyday lives in recent years however since the year  the companys revenue has experienced four major contractions that predictably led to steep losses for micron shareholders more on that below before turning to its stock price though we need to look at the rest of microns cost structure which plays an important role in a broader discussion of the giant chipmaker micron technologys gross and net margins as is the case for most companies that lack pricing power micron technologys margin structure shows a tremendous amount of variability when times are good the company can produce significant profits however when memory chip prices soften  either due to economic weakness or marketwide supplyanddemand imbalances  its profits can nosedive deep into the red as the following charts demonstrate mu gross profit margin ttm data by ycharts its also important to note that microns cost structure differs from that of chipmakers like qualcomm in that it owns and operates its own semiconductor manufacturing plants  this means microns cost structure is more rigid than that of firms that outsource their chip fabrication the added fixed costs that come with this strategy make microns bottom line more sensitive to revenue changes big picture its important to note that microns lack of pricing power gross margins and its more rigid cost structure net margins go a long way toward explaining the companys highly cyclical stock price micron technologys stock price because of the above factors it should come as no surprise that microns stock has also swung wildly over the years take a look at the companys historical performance against its benchmark the nasdaq composite mu data by ycharts this nicely captures my cautious take on micron particularly for longterm buyandhold investors micron can generate marketbeating returns when investors buy its shares during a pricing rut and hold them until memory prices recover which is exactly the scenario that has played out with micron over the past year or so unfortunately shareholders who have mistimed their investments  we dont believe in trying to time the market here at the fool  have lost their shirts to be sure times are flush at micron right now and the continued recovery in its business has wall street analysts as bullish as ever  however the companys highly cyclical nature and lack of meaningful pricing power suggest this same scenario will eventually take place ultimately this isnt an attempt to dissuade investors from
