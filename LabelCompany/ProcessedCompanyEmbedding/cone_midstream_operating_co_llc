define ebitda as net income before income taxes net interest expense depreciation and amortization  ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors industry analysts lenders and ratings agencies to assess our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry without regard to financing methods historical cost basis or capital structure the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities we believe that the presentation of ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations  the gaap measures most directly comparable to ebitda are net income and net cash provided by operating activities  ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap  ebitda excludes some but not all items that affect net income or net cash and these measures may vary from those of other companies  as a result ebitda as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as ebitda less net cash interest paid and maintenance capital expenditures  distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors industry analysts lenders and ratings agencies to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions to our unitholders and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities we believe that the presentation of distributable cash flow in this report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations  the gaap measures most directly

cash and these measures may vary from those of other companies  as a result our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies the partnership does not provide financial guidance for projected net income or changes in working capital and therefore is unable to provide a reconciliation of its adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow projections to
