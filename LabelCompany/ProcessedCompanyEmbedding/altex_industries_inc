by russ gager profiles altex industries inc email facebook twitter google linkedin stumble heat exchangers are pressure vessels filled with a bundle of tubes that can cool or heat materials used in the process and petrochemical industries many are so dense with tubing that they can weigh tons fabricating heat transfer equipment at a competitive price with failsafe quality is a complex process that requires highly skilled craftsmen and foolproof procedures and processes in order to manufacture its products and compete with offshore companies that have far lower wage rates altex industries inc must continuously seek out innovative ideas and incorporate them into its production processes and maintenance techniques this past october altex industries unveiled a squarefoot expansion of its fabrication plant in edmonton alberta bringing it to  square feet of production floor space “we’re pushing  square feet total with our offices and other buildings” president durwill dennis calculates with the expansion the facility now includes an additional overhead crane rail with four ton cranes on the same rail “it allows us to do basically anything that comes in the door” dennis maintains “what we do is very specific and a very highly engineered product so consequently our quality assurance is high “mainly we are in the steamassisted gravity program which means we’re heating the oil for the process side” dennis explains “that is the largest volume of our work all we’re doing is heating the oil up to be able to put it into a pipeline for transportation” besides the oil natural gas and petrochemical industries altex’s products are also used in the agricultural industry “we work for a pretty broad base” dennis says “every plant has heat exchangers in it so we heat or cool whatever needs to be done we strictly work from customer specifications we have our own design group who work with our clients within what their input feeds are and the desired outputs” totally tubular the principle of heat exchangers is to circulate a liquid – sometimes a coolant such as glycol which is similar to the coolant used in automotive radiators – or a heated liquid or gas through a series of tubes that contact the liquid or gas that needs to be cooled or heated the tube bundle is situated inside the pressure vessel some heat exchangers use a single pass and others depending on their design and requirements require six to eight passes large exchangers may have as many as  tubes in them  “since the vessel is up to  feet long what creates a lot of the weight is all the tubing in them” dennis explains in some cases the tubing is so dense in heat exchangers that it is possible for a footlong exchanger to weigh up to  tons much of the fabrication material for heat exchangers is tubing which is preordered for each project in the specified lengths and diameters from europe or china “chinese tube is what we’re using now because of the pricing” dennis says “when it comes in we’ll have  or  truckloads of tubing at a time” the tubing used in altex heat exchangers is produced according to industry standards and tested when the heat exchanger is finished “when we finish our bundles we install them into the shell and everything is hydrotested to  times working pressure” dennis notes “that’s one step in how we determine the quality” manufacturing processes besides bending tubing so it passes back and forth within a heat exchanger and welding it to the tube sheet altex industries also machines a large number of forgings “a lot of our big heavy flanges come in as forgings” dennis explains “anything in a tube sheet that is over  inches thick comes in as a forging a good portion of our production time is spent in machining and drilling the component pieces of the exchanger upfront” two production lines – one for the tube bundles and the other for the pressure vessels – converge within the altex facility “the two of them come together at the end and we push the bundle into the shell complete the hydrotest and then we’re ready to go for paint” dennis says generally the heat exchangers are covered with insulation so painting is important for corrosionproofing most of the heat exchangers altex industries manufactures are customdesigned and manufactured “it’s all fairly laborintensive what we do” dennis concedes “we’ve got the welding setup and that’s automated as much as we can the rest is machining drilling fitting and welding” automation embraced where automation can be introduced it is used extensively “we actively seek out automation processes and incorporate them where possible” dennis declares “there isn’t too much out there that we aren’t using we use all the latest and greatest in welding processes and equipment we’re constantly doing rd we have purposebuilt specialized equipment that we conceived designed and manufactured inhouse which is far more productive than anything you can buy because it is custombuilt for our process” that custommanufactured equipment has made significant improvements in productivity at the production facility which operates  “we’ve done some things on our production line that have tripled and quadrupled our production in some areas such as tube bending” he continues “i’m confident there’s nobody around that does tube bending with the efficiency we work with – we built the bender everybody manually pushes tubes – we mechanically push them visitors routinely comment that we are one of the neatest tidiest and most automated shops they go into as an organization we’re quite proud of our innovative measures” the level of automation welding and manual assembly required at altex industries necessitates retaining highly skilled employees “the product we build is very precise” dennis says “essentially we are putting a machined cylinder – the tube bundle – inside a newly fabricated pressure vessel and very tight tolerances are necessary we have very high standards that our people must meet” employees are recruited from the ranks of boilermakers and sometimes brought in from outside of canada “we have very low turnover” dennis asserts “people come first in our operation and they are our most critical resource anybody can build a building anybody can buy equipment but you can’t operate without good people” gaining momentum altex also provides field service “not only do we engineer design and manufacture our product but we also take it to the field and do installation as well as service” dennis points out “as these huge plants get built installation and service is becoming a bigger part of our business every year we’re gaining momentum in that area and have the opportunity to really grow that side of our business so we’re in a growth pattern on both sides” dennis estimates approximately  percent of altex revenue is from field services but he expects that percentage to increase to  percent in the future altex field services was formerly named evtex field services but the company decided it wanted to emphasize the altex brand because some customers did not realize that evtex was part of altex industries “the strength is not just in fabrication or the shop side” dennis stresses “they get a full meal deal when they come to do business with altex” altex industries has purchased new mobile equipment that will help the field services division when it performs maintenance on shutdown process plants “we have truckmounted bundle pullers the only two i’m aware of in canada” dennis maintains “they have some in the us we have radiocontrolled grapples which are unique to any other design that’s around they’re far more compact and have far more capacity we have also built some tubebundled transport equipment which is unique to our company nobody else has them” the privately held company has typically serviced the three western provinces of canada but has recently started providing field services in ontario and aims for  percent growth annually  altex industries was bought by dennis and a group of operating and silent partners in  “i came in here for six months to a year to clean it up and then i was going to do other things” he explains “i got working at it and saw the potential that was there and we’ve managed to grow it ever since”  check out our latest edition subscribe for free   archive tweets by
