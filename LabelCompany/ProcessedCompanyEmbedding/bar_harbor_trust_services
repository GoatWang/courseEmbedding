prose and therefore should not be relied on for grammatical accuracy this is not a verbatim transcript parts have been slightly modified to improve readability berkeley capital partners is a registered investment advisor in atlanta georgia chris eddy cfp® partner investment officer berkeley capital partners tony palazzo cfa berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but if you do i think with the way the industry’s changing you should look into it and you should

independent i truly felt i could put them first brittany albert lincoln capital “our fear clients wouldn’t follow” they did here’s why the myth about going independent is that you can’t provide what your clients are used to but we actually had more options and fewer constraints to help our clients achieve their goals than ever before don garman mirador capital partners “we feared we’d have less to offer” we had more here’s why you hear about all the things you are limited to as an independent but the opposite is true we not only had access to more unique products but we could offer them at

verbatim transcript parts have been slightly modified to improve readability berkeley capital partners is a registered investment advisor in atlanta georgia chris eddy cfp® partner investment officer berkeley capital partners tony palazzo cfa berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but if you do i think with the way the industry’s changing you should look into it and you should probably look into it as soon as possible important disclosures information included during this video is
