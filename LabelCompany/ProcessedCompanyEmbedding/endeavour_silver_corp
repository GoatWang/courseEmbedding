ask the ceo ask the ceo to submit a question to the ceo please send it to asktheceoedrsilvercom june   q i see you recently acquired several small properties in zacatecas are they not too small for a midsized silver company like endeavour what is your strategy in zacatecas a we entered the zacatecas mining district in  with the  million acquisition of the el compas property and the leased la plata government plant normally we would not consider acquiring such a small project but the mine is already permitted shallow and high grade and the leased plant is already permitted based on our recent preliminary economic assessment the low capex  million and low allin sustaining cost  per silver equivalent oz estimates generate accretive cash flows and profit margins for endeavour we therefore view the el compas project as picking “low hanging fruit” that establishes a foothold for us in the region and a foundation on which to grow zacatecas state has a rich silver mining history that dates back to the th century it is the largest silver producing state in mexico and home to some of the world’s largest silver mines including the world class fresnillo mine other mining companies active in the state include goldcorp pan american silver first majestic silver and mag silver with el compas having such a great address our focus has now turned to building critical mass by picking up other prospective properties in the district to grow reserves increase production and extend the mine life the recently acquired calicanto and veta grande properties were acquired for their nearterm mine exploration and development potential we are now drilling at calicanto we expect to start developing the main access ramp at el compas in the third quarter and we hope to permit and drill the veta grande properties later this year stay tuned for news as we get busy in this prospective silver mining district   may   q why has there been so much volatility in your stock recently a you are correct our stock has been particularly volatile in recent weeks and we believe the gdxj etf index fund rebalancing is the main reason at the date of their most recent filing the gdxj held  of endeavour’s issued and outstanding shares – making them by far our largest shareholder their holdings had been steadily creeping up as the size of the fund grew and they were rapidly approaching the  threshold in many of their holdings not just endeavour silver they cannot own more than  in any company because it would breach their etf policies and trigger certain takeover and disclosure laws to address this the gdxj managers recently announced a change in their investment methodology to allow more larger cap companies into the fund thereby reducing their exposure to the junior companies the j in gdxj as a result they have been reducing their positions in all of their current gdxj holdings and buying the larger cap mining shares to be added to the index we believe this rebalancing of the gdxj holdings is primarily what caused the recent volatility and price decline in our stock there is no other fundamental reason for the selloff as our operations remain on track to meet  guidance and we are cash flow positive at current metal prices   april   q why did endeavour’s share price fall  in just one day in early march  a we don’t know why endeavour’s share price fell so sharply on march  it does not appear to have been a large institutional seller nor a large short seller one shareholder suggested it could have been shortterm algorithmic traders all going negative on silver at the same time but we cannot confirm that on the day in question we released our  financial results when the precious metal prices were falling so the market appears to have focused on our higher q costs rather than our strong annual results we have a lot of positive news coming this year and if we do a good job on our operating mines and development projects we are confident the market will rebound   march   q your el compas economics look very good but the proposed new mine is very small why bother to build such a small mine and how can you make it a core asset a we are excited to be back in growth mode after focusing on reducing our operating costs at our three mines during the fouryear bear market for precious metals this week’s announcement shows that even though the mineral resource is small and high grade the pea provides robust economic returns with the low capital investment of us million funded by existing cash and the short timeline of six months to initial production el compas mine has the nearterm potential to become a healthy contributor to our consolidated cash flow small can be beautiful and our philosophy is to develop a profitable mine first then see how we can expand it to become a core asset we expect allin sustaining costs to be less than  per oz silver equivalent so el compas not only expands our metal production it will help reduce our consolidated operating costs the operation is scalable so when we discover or acquire additional mineral resources in the zacatecas district then we can refurbish the second ball mill to double the plant capacity to  tonnes per day our exploration program will continue in  with a plan to drill  metres to test new targets on the property and look for opportunities to consolidate land holdings in the district stay tuned for more developments as we advance this exciting new project to become our fourth mine   october   q in q you reported a significant drop in silver production compared to both q this year and q last year mainly due to guanaceví even though you have three development projects now in the pipeline for future development what does the future production look like for the three mines currently operating a our silver production outlook at the three operating mines is stable over the near term but all three mines have some unused plant capacity so we are aggressively exploring and developing these mining properties to extend their mine lives guanaceví is our oldest and highest grade silver mine and we have identified several areas to explore and develop to extend its mine life also the guanacevi orebodies are higher grade at the top and lower grade at the bottom because we are now mining toward the bottom of the porvenir norte orebody and into the middle of santa cruz our consolidated grades have been lower in recent quarters but when we open up the top of the santa cruz sur orebody next year followed by the shallow extensions of porvenir norte dos and cuatro the consolidated grades are expected to return to previous levels which will boost both our silver grades and production at the other mines – bolañitos and el cubo – we are well ahead of our  guidance on both production and costs and like guanacevi we are exploring and developing new areas to extend their mine lives   october   q the silver price had a big bounce off its low early this year and it looks like a new precious metal cycle is underway what are you doing to grow the company again  a it is amazing how quickly our silver mining sector turned its focus this year from survival to growth endeavour silver has been more active than most silver companies in responding to these new market conditions firstly we reversed our january decision to take our el cubo mine down to care and maintenance by yearend with el cubo back operating at close to its  tpd capacity we boosted our production guidance in july and now expect to produce between  and  million ounces of silver equivalents this year secondly we turned our attention to rebuilding our project development pipeline through acquisitions while asset prices are still depressed we recently acquired the el compas gold project in zacatecas state and have entered into a binding agreement to acquire the parral silver property in chihuahua state both are small but scalable highquality mining projects located in large historic mining districts with nearterm lowcost production potential and strong exploration upside last but not least our emerging new highgrade silvergold discovery on the terronera property in jalisco state is now subject to a prefeasibility study for a possible production decision by the end of    what are we doing to fuel our next phase of growth in endeavour we propose to build three new mines over the next three years our fiveyear goal is to double our annual silver equivalent production to  million ounces and drive our operating costs down to the lowest quartile in the sector our three new projects will take us halfway to that goal and we are still motivated to grow through organic mine expansions and additional ma these next five years should be very exciting for endeavour shareholders    july   q now that you have made the decision to continue operating the el cubo mine and not wind it down to care and maintenance later this year what are your plans for bringing production back up to  tonnes per day and how will you extend its mine life a we were successful in reducing allin sustaining costs at el cubo down to the  per oz range by q of this year and with the recent resurgence in the silver price to  per oz we can once again make money at el cubo therefore we revised our guidance to produce at about  tonnes per day tpd for the remainder of this year but we have already refined our mine plan and we now expect to be back producing at  tpd this quarter we can do this with a modest  million investment in underground development to push the main access ramp in ore rather than waste at the vasunción orebody down to the lowest mine level beyond  we have additional resources but el cubo will require significant investments in exploration and development in order to bring them into the mine plan and continue operating we also have exploration targets that with luck can become discoveries and future mine developments at el cubo   april   q the silver price until recently lagged the gold price this year pushing the gold to silver ratio above  to  now it has backed down to  to  what is your short term view on silver vs gold a silver historically lags gold entering into a new cycle but typically catches up with a bang since gold bottomed late last year and had a nice bounce to start the year it does look like a new cycle for the precious metals is now under way so it is no surprise silver lagged gold if you recall the last cycle gold started rising off bottom in march  but silver did not start to move until november  when gold was already significantly higher but then silver almost doubled in six months from a fundamental point of view wall street is still focused on the risk of falling electronic demand due to the global economic slowdown whereas main street is starting to recognize that silver production topped last year and is forecast to decline for several years due to lack of new discoveries and mine development so silver was bound to play catch up to gold and it did just that over the past two weeks however these gold and silver markets are now overheated and looking a bit toppy so my short term view is that gold and silver should correct soon after which time should follow an attractive buying opportunity in advance of the next upleg in the precious metal cycle   march   q endeavour silver shares are up  ytd but gold and silver are only up  why has there been such a jump in your share price in the first quarter a i think there are three main reasons why our share price has rebounded so well this year first endeavour silver shares were oversold last year due largely to our sectorleading leverage to the silver price leverage is a doubleedged sword because when precious metals prices fall our share price falls more than our peers but when precious metals prices rise our shares bounce back more than our peers   second we announced in late january our plan to focus on generating free cash flow from our highcost el cubo mine this year by ramping production down to care and maintenance by yearend since el cubo’s high costs were a drag on our cash flow and share performance cutting costs and reducing production to make free cash flow this year was taken as positive news by the market third our renewed focus on expanding the resources at our exciting new terronera project in mexico and engineering a larger mine to improve the already robust economics in order to complete a prefeasibility study could drive a significant revaluation of our future cash flow and therefore share price   february   q thank you for being the first silver producer to reduce rather than increase your production at this time of low silver prices why arent more silver producers focusing on profits instead of production a first and foremost our decision to ramp down production at el cubo to care and maintenance late this year was driven by our policy that each mine should be profitable whatever the silver price is el cubo was a high cost mine when we bought it in  but the silver price at that time was over  per oz we thought we could drive the costs down substantially to make money at  per oz if we invested in modernizing and expanding the entire operation we successfully completed that plan on time and budget but by then silver had fallen below  per oz so we executed a phase  mine expansion last year to reduce allin costs even further the good news is that our operating group successfully drove the allin sustaining costs at el cubo from more than  per oz in  to less than  per oz in q  the bad news is that the silver price crashed down to  per oz where it is now therefore we made the difficult but right decision to reduce production at el cubo down to care and maintenance make some profits at the mine this year and keep the ounces in the ground for future production at higher silver prices our other two mines at guanaceví and bolañitos have been profitable for years and continue to generate free cash flow even at  per oz silver i cannot speak for other silver miners but we run our business to generate shortterm positive cash flow and longterm growth of profits which ultimately drives accretive growth and substantial returns for our shareholders   september   q normally gold and silver prices start rising at this time of year due to rising physical demand but this year the precious metals still seem to be stuck at low prices why a it may be a bit early to draw conclusions about whether gold and silver prices will enjoy their normal seasonal strength from september to march but there are certainly other larger short term factors currently weighing down these precious metal pm prices first the recent strength of the usd tied to an improving us economy puts a dampening effect on all commodity prices all the talk this year by the us federal reserve bank about raising interest rates has really put pressure on the pms because conventional wisdom would have us believe higher rates attract global capital away from commodities into usd equities and bonds interestingly a quick review shows that the last five times the us fed raised interest rates the gold price increased by an average of  in the following three months and in three of the cases continued to appreciate for two years in other words the markets discounted the rate increases beforehand and sold off after the fact second the recent crash in chinese equities spilled over into other global equity markets sparking a rush to the safety and liquidity of the usd and a sharp increase in pm shorts which were only partially covered over the past two weeks this causes a domino effect because equity investors trading on margin like chinese speculators then have to sell other investments like gold to cover their margin calls in the past such periods were ephemeral and passed relatively quickly third the recent devaluation of the chinese yuan actually made gold and silver prices higher in their currency reducing demand and further depressing the seasonal effect in fact many emerging country currencies have and are depreciating against the usd so gold is rising in many local currencies however gold has continued to decline in indian rupees so it is reasonable to assume that physical demand in india should resume after the current liquidity crisis passes i think all these events and recent market volatility are directly related to the ongoing debt and deficit crisis in many developed countries especially europe and china such global issues are the main reason why investors hold gold and silver as stores of value but they take time to unfold   july   q endeavour silver just released its annual review and sustainability report for  you seem to do a lot more than whats required  with operating costs being a major issue these days why spend more than you need to a it comes down to our mission to find build and operate quality silver mines in a sustainable way to create real value for stakeholders by continually improving what we do and how we do it we aim to make a positive difference in peoples lives our motto this year growth with integrity reflects our personal values of honesty and integrity and our people first business strategy we embrace sustainability throughout our organization because it ultimately makes us more productive as an organization it motivates employees and management inspires governments and communities and leaves behind a legacy of positive lasting benefits when the mines are gone we accomplished a lot with our sustainability programs last year notwithstanding two minesite fatalities to which we responded with rigorous safety retraining programs at each mine and the hiring of a new senior safety trainer our safety performance did improve significantly as measured by other safety indicators we reported a  reduction in the number of reportable accidents and a  reduction in the reportable frequency rate we continued to expand and improve our social and environmental programs last year for which we received multiple awards in  including the socially responsible company award for all three mines and a supporting the environment award for bolañitos and el cubo endeavour planted  trees and cacti in  as part of its environmental reclamation program contributions to education and employability remain one of our top sustainability initiatives at guanaceví we signed an agreement with one of the top mexican private universities to provide access to online education for people in the community selfemployment initiatives at bolañitos continue to grow and the local women who have participated remain active learning and benefiting from their small businesses sustainability is really just recognizing what is needed to get the job done in the best way possible so in that sense it is not new in the mining industry over a century ago prospectors and miners opened up frontier areas by not only finding new orebodies but by doing what was needed to build and operate the mines they brought in and trained the miners built the towns and churches installed the power and water supplies provided transportation and recreation basically built full community services because thats what was needed standards were certainly different in those days but our concept is the same we do our best to maximize returns and minimize risks for all stakeholders   june   q there have been lots of mergers and acquisitions ma in the gold mining space over the past two years and even senior silver mining companies have been acquiring gold mines but there have been very few silver acquisitions why is that and what if anything is endeavour doing to grow by ma a you are quite right the fact is there are very few ma opportunities in the silver space and even fewer economically robust silver projects or mines or companies at these low precious metal prices which is why most silver miners are looking at gold opportunities as there are more to choose from we have been fortunate to own two economically robust silvergold mines at guanaceví and bolañitos in recent years and the current mine expansion at our el cubo mine is intended to drive its allin sustaining costs down so that it too can start making free cash flow although our emerging new highgrade discovery at terronera is currently the subject of a prefeasibility study to become our fourth mine management is still motivated to grow through ma as well like other companies we have expanded our ma strategy in the past two years  even though we prefer mexico we are now looking in canada usa peru and chile even though we prefer silver dominant opportunities we are now looking at gold dominant opportunities and even though we prefer operating mines we are looking at exploration and development stage mines and companies to add to our project pipeline for future growth there are typically three types of ma transactions available major transactions such as a merger of equals to acquire a profitable mine or company for immediate growth moderate transactions to acquire large development projects for nearterm growth and minor transactions to acquire attractive exploration projects for longterm growth we firmly believe the adage buy low sell high applies to company ma as well as investments and we would very much like to do at least one ma transaction if not more this year while metal stock and property prices are low having said that it takes two to tango to make a winwin deal   may   q your terronera preliminary economic assessment pea looks economic but small why not focus on more exploration drilling to expand the resources for a larger mine rather than trying to finance and build a small mine when silver prices are so low a good question we will certainly consider doing that if the silver price when we complete the prefeasibility study later this year is still below  per oz however our business model has been to start small and enjoy early cash flow in order to help fund exploration make new discoveries develop new mines and grow the business organically this worked very well for us in the past and terronera is conceptually no different from our first three mines so we will follow the same phased approach to development our intent is to start small by building a  tonne per day tpd operation within a  tpd footprint by the time this phase  mine is built and producing we will have almost two more years of drill results to potentially support a lowcost phase  expansion to  tpd while we think terronera has excellent potential to expand the resources and production any potential expansion will be based on further exploration success therefore infill drilling of the inferred resource is now underway and stepout drilling is scheduled to commence in the second half of this year at  tpd terronera would be our smallest mine producing about  million silver equivalent ag eq oz per year but at  tpd it would become our largest mine producing around  million ag eq oz the low estimated pea cash costs of us per oz silver and allin sustaining costs of  per oz both net of gold credits imply it could also become our most profitable mine   april   q gender diversity in business has recently become a hot topic mining is historically a male dominated industry what are you doing to attract more women to endeavour a we recognize the benefits arising from diversity in our workforce including gender sexual orientation and ethnicity by embracing diversity we broaden our skill sets and experience and access different outlooks and perspectives which ultimately should result in better outcomes for our stakeholders we have been successful at this because we recruit retain reward and develop our people based upon their abilities and contributions despite the paucity of female professionals and tradespeople in the mining sector we have been able to attract qualified women to certain positions for example when we bought the bolañitos mine in  the mining sector was suffering from a serious skills shortage and hiring geologists was extremely competitive we posted some job openings in guanajuato and were fortunate to attract some female mexican geologists as applicants although they were short on experience our vp exploration provided them with on the job training and they turned out to be very productive employees smart diligent and hard working a couple of them have been promoted on merit and now manage our exploration groups in guanajuato another example of our desire to diversify is our mining skills training schools like the professions there is a lack of skilled mining equipment operators in our sector so endeavour launched its mining schools in order to provide the young or unemployed in mexico with career skills that will last a lifetime since  we have trained over  students including dozens of women in such skills as truck driving scoop tramming and jumbo drilling while we do not support the adoption of quotas to support our diversity policy we recruit and employ people based on their qualifications abilities and contributions we are committed to fostering a diverse workplace environment where individual differences and opinions are heard and respected and employment opportunities are based on the qualifications required for a particular position at a particular time including training experience performance skill and merit you will find our diversity policy on the website here   march   q your mine lives look to be quite short compared to some of your peers should we shareholders be concerned that endeavour is going to run out of ore a actually neither guanaceví nor bolañitos had any mine life no reserves or resources when we bought them and el cubos mine life was very short so you may also wonder how we managed not only to restart the mining operations but grow the production on a regular basis what we recognized at each mine site was that even though these mines had prolific histories of small scale production they had received very little modern exploration and we thought the exploration potential for new discoveries was excellent over the past  years we have established an enviable track record of making new discoveries to drive organic growth and we remain bullish on the potential to extend the mine lives of our operations due to the geological nature of underground mines our mine lives will always be considered short compared to larger open pit mines and our highergrade epithermal vein orebodies are more reasonably explored and developed over a number of years hence the smaller annual reserves and resources last year we once again replaced our silver reserves by underground development and expanded our silver resources by surface drilling another reason why our mine lives may be shorter than some peers is our conservative approach to reserve estimation we do not estimate reserves based on drilling only on driving tunnels and given how much time and money are needed for underground development it just makes better sense to convert resources to reserves on an annual basis at guanaceví we discovered two new zones of high grade silvergold mineralization in  porvenir centro adjacent to the main santa cruz mine ramp and santa cruz sur just south of our producing santa cruz mine at bolañitos exploration drilling successfully delineated the llasunción orebody which is now in development with production expected to begin this year at el cubo we made the new villalpandoasunción discovery in  delineated it last year and it is now the anchor of our current production while we have many exploration targets at the three mine sites yet to be tested it is certainly true that each mine will ultimately run out of ore however we are not there yet and our focus continues to be squarely on extending our mine lives through our brownfields acquisition and exploration strategy   march   q endeavours operating costs have been drifting higher since  what are you doing to reduce both cash costs and allin sustaining costs aisc in order to preserve free cash flow and profit margin a profit margins have shrunk industrywide since  due to the sharp fall in precious metal prices so all mining companies are battling to cut costs and maintain free cash flow endeavour has enjoyed many years of strong aftertax free cash flow totaling  million from guanaceví since  and  million from bolañitos since  at endeavour cash costs net of the gold byproduct credit have risen the last three years for three reasons  the value of our gold credit has fallen   labour and consumable costs have risen about  each year and  we bought the high cost el cubo mine in  and turned the corner on its cash costs at the end of  endeavour has been cutting cash costs by increasing productivity controlling grade at the mines and improving metal recoveries at the plants our optimization efforts succeeded in reducing cash costs in  at both guanacevi from  down to  per oz and el cubo from  down to  per oz compared to the previous year we recently announced a significant expansion at el cubo that will see el cubo cash costs fall once again and our  consolidated cash costs remain below  per ounce of silver produced our allin sustaining costs which include all costs except investments for growth came in at  per ounce last year the el cubo expansion will allow us to maintain aisc in the same range as  even with the lower metal prices because we bought small underground mines in historic districts in need of operational turnarounds and exploration discoveries to drive production growth our exploration and mine development capital budgets are typically high in the early years of mine expansion and then fall to sustainable levels once the mines stop growing our combined capital and exploration spending has been declining at guanacevi since  bolanitos since  and el cubo since    march   q  do lower oil prices benefit endeavours operating costs a yes but only in a small way because we are not big diesel consumers like large open pit mines and their oversized trucks we are on the power grid in mexico and the price of oil is subsidized and regulated in mexico so both power and diesel prices have not moved down much in recent months however i should point out that all oil producing nations like mexico have seen their currencies weaken vs the us dollar the mexican peso has effectively devalued  in recent months and that does have a beneficial effect on endeavours operating costs   february   q  what is your precious metals price outlook for  and why a i am moderately bullish on gold and silver prices this year notwithstanding the strengthening us dollar analyst consensus prices average about us per oz gold and us silver for  from a fundamental point of view total gold supply has been falling in recent years due to reduced scrap recycling the only new gold supply since  has been sales from the gold etfs and that trend recently reversed itself from net sales to net purchases in january  on the demand side india posted a record year and china had a near record year of gold imports in  and we can assume most of that gold disappeared into jewelry coins and bars so not available for resale or lease unlike the gold inventories held by central banks and bullion banks from a technical point of view gold broke the previous  ½ year down trend in january and moved up on strength so i think the bottom is in and a two steps forward one step back pattern will dominate gold this year with support around us and resistance levels up to us silver is a bit different because it is both a currency and a commodity whereas gold is simply a currency and store of value furthermore most new silver production comes as a byproduct of gold copper and zinc mines rather than from primary silver producers and those other companies are quite happy to hedge their future silver production fundamentally silver supply rises each year due to rising mine production but there has been and will continue to be a total supplydemand deficit because silver demand has been rising faster due to rising industrial usage for electronics solar panels and many other emerging new high tech uses in addition to investment demand remarkably the silver etfs have seen no net sales since this market correction began in  which suggests that silver investors are longer term than gold investors technically silver also broke its downtrend and established an uptrend in january but it is subject to global economic forces so is lagging gold as shown by the high silvergold ratio once again i think the bottom is in and a volatile two steps forward one step back pattern should also dominate silver this year with support around us and resistance levels up to us   february   q  your guidance in  is for lower silver production this year endeavour has been one of the fastest growing silver producers for many years so is this a change of strategy or a temporary reduction a endeavour established an enviable track record for accretive growth over its first  years of operations by buying small mines in historic districts bringing the money and expertise needed to turn them around from losing money to making money and making new discoveries that could be fasttracked to production however guanaceví and bolañitos are now mature mines operating at capacity with short mine lives so this year we plan to reduce production at bolañitos while we model our next phase of growth at el cubo and san sebastián therefore this is not a change of strategy just a transition period as we prepare to expand el cubo and build san sebastián   february   q  endeavour delivered its th consecutive year of record silver production in  how were you able to do that a our silver production grew in  thanks largely to the hard work and expertise of our operating teams in mexico the operations group at guanaceví turned in a spectacular year producing one million ounces above plan and achieving the highest throughput in our history of owning the mine specifically both ore grades and metal recoveries improved as the higher grade porvenir cuatro and santa cruz mines replaced falling production from the lower grade porvenir norte mine at bolañitos our people continued to generate strong free cash flow even at low metal prices and met all their targets for the year at el cubo mine personnel launched the yes we can program to raise both grades and throughput significantly in the fourth quarter and finished the year with a bang by achieving our goal of ramping up mine production to plant capacity by yearend   october   q  mr cooke why were you selling endeavour shares last week at these low prices a thanks for your question i was exercising some options that are set to expire and my last opportunity to do so would be on november  because insiders are blacked out from trades in the market during financial reporting periods last week was my last chance to sell stock in order cover the cost of exercising these options i sold enough stock to cover the exercise price and the associated personal income taxes i ended up with a net purchase of  shares and endeavour received  my trades accounted for only  of the trading volumes on those days please note that i have been a net buyer of endeavour stock this year – most recently acquiring  shares on market in september at cdn   september   q  what is endeavour doing to prevent a tailings accident like the recent mount polley spill in bc a its a very good question because the incident at mount polley has raised concerns about the engineering and safety of tailings dams not just in canada and the usa but around the globe once people understand what happened at mount polley there is a possibility that permitting of new tailings facilities and the monitoring of existing ones could face increased scrutiny companies will be held to a higher standard and communities will have greater confidence new technologies such as paste thickened tailings or dry stack tailings – which remove up to  of moisture from tailings –significantly reduce the risks of catastrophic failure at endeavour the safety and sustainability of our operations are top priority one example of this is the transition we made in  from standard wet tailings held in a pond behind a dam to dry stack tailings piled on a hillside at our guanacevi mine dry stack tailings come at a significantly higher capital and operating cost but offer many benefits such as being easier to close and rehabilitate they require a smaller footprint compared to wet tailings they can be used in areas of steep terrain high seismic activity or where water conservation is critical and they allow for progressive rehabilitation of land to return it to its natural state at all three of our mines we monitor the stability of our tailings using water wells aerial mapping and satellite imagery we engage a worldclass third party engineering consultant to design evaluate the stability and performance of our tailings facilities and adjustments are made to the structures volumes and flow of material as needed we aim to not only meet local laws and regulations related to tailings management but to exceed them where possible focusing on sustainable development and adoption of best environmental practices   august   q  why did endeavour’s share price fall after the q earnings announcement this week a thanks for your question it’s difficult to predict how the market will react when companies release earnings because there are many other factors at play including volatility in the metals prices and stock markets in this case it appears that investors of silver stocks in general are looking for a short term correction from the high of last week and several other silver mining companies who released their q financial results this week suffered similar if not greater reductions in their share prices expectations for endeavour in particular may have been that q financial results would be a repeat of our stellar outperformance in q in fact there should have been no surprises as we prereleased q production in early july and it was lower as forecast than q gold grades which were unusually high in q reverted to planned grades in q as expected which reduced our gold credit and therefore increased our cash cost per oz throughput and production were also lower in q compared to q due to the temporary closures of the porvenir cuatro mine at guanaceví and the santa cecilia mine at el cubo following two fatal accidents in late marchearly april all of this was expected to impact throughput in q but we remain on track – in fact slightly ahead of – fullyear guidance for production of  million ounces of silver and  ounces of silver in  last but not least we paid our annual profit share tax with the employees in q which also impacted our earnings during the quarterp regarding our sustaining and growth costs q and q are typically our peak spending quarters for capital and exploration programs we now have  drill rigs working across our three mines and our exploration property san sebastián this increased spending combined with lower throughput and ounces resulted in higher cash costs and allin sustaining costs aisc in q compared to q however we remain solidly on track to meet our fullyear guidance for cash costs in the  per ounce range and aisc of less than  per ounce   april   q  ive read about problems another canadian company is having with illegal miners near guanajuato in mexico are you experiencing similar problems at your mines and if so what are you doing about it a the short answer is no but your question is a good one because it relates to both safety as well as security not just for our people but also for the communities where we work illegal mining is a situation we take very seriously and we work closely with local and state authorities to keep our operations secure in many instances illegal miners are inexperienced and by entering the underground mining areas without permission they risk injury or even death due to a lack of safety equipment and poor conditions further their presence would threaten the integrity of our operations and workers we have a strong security presence at our mines and have closed the historic underground mine adits and entrances thereby eliminating these historic means of access from time to time we have caught illegal miners trying to gain access our mines but we work closely with the authorities to charge them with trespassing to prevent and resolve these situations the safety of our people is our top priority and we actively monitor access at each of our mines to ensure no illegal miners can trespass   march   q  you reported a financial loss in your  financial results how can that be given that all three mines performed well last year delivering higher throughput grades and recoveries a our reported  loss incorporated a number of noncash items that reflected much lower precious metals prices at the end of  compared to the previous year the spot price of silver fell  in  and the price of gold was nearly  lower assuming these prices continue there is a negative impact on potential future cash flows which in turn affects the value of the assets that we have recorded on our books accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability on our historical investment using the current price environment none of the impairment charges affected cash flow and in fact  marked steady increases in revenue cash flow and ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization this was due to the  increase in silver equivalent production we recorded in  over the previous year cash costs remained below  per ounce of silver production and allin sustaining costs which is the new metric mining companies are using to report the total cost of running a mine including sustaining capital were below  per ounce in  even with the dramatic decline in spot prices we added  million to the balance sheet in the second half of the year we still generated healthy cash flows in  and we anticipate healthy cash flows in    february   q  several of your peers are forecasting strong production growth in  yet endeavour’s is holding flat what is your thinking behind that decision a after delivering our ninth consecutive year of growth in  we decided to hold steady on production – not because we don’t have the ability to grow but because we don’t see the point of pushing production when metal prices are so low and we do see an opportunity here to hone the operations and polish our operating and financial performance by that i mean we plan to optimize operating efficiencies reduce costs and increase profit margins while precious metals prices are low that should better position endeavour to outperform our peers when the metal prices do finally start to rise we want to be one of the top performing silver producers when prices start to move up and we believe this prudent and disciplined approach will get us there   february   q  is endeavour doing anything to take advantage of opportunities to create value through consolidation in the mining sector in this low silver price environment a yes  our goal is to become a senior silver producer  million ounces of silver production per year in the next three years we can do that through internal organic growth – building expanding and improving our own mines – or by mergers or acquisitions our san sebastián project an organic discovery we made in mexico in  has the potential to become our fourth mine and will advance to an economic evaluation this year at the same time we are evaluating opportunities to grow through a merger acquisition or consolidation at this point in the precious metals price cycle equity valuations are heavily discounted and there are a few companies with good assets trading at steep discounts our ma strategy is simple we are looking to add core assets with the potential to add five million ounces per year of silver equivalent production per year that we can operate at a profit   november   q  i understand mexico is introducing several new taxes that impact mining  how will this affect endeavours profits going forward  is mexico still an attractive country for new mining investments a  yes mexico is in the process of legislatinag a new fiscal reform act that introduces many new or higher taxes for both citizens and corporations in mexico including some new taxes on mining  the fiscal reform act was recently approved by both the mexican chamber of deputies and the senate and is now pending ratification by president pena nieto on or before november  to be effective january    the tax reform includes among other items the elimination of the previously proposed decrease in the mexican corporate tax rate from  to  a special mining duty of  on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and an  environmental tax on gold and silver revenues a  dividend tax and the elimination of the annual deduction of greenfields exploration expenses from income before tax  virtually every silver mining company is impacted because most of us have mines in mexico so silver mining companies in general will be reporting higher tax payments and therefore lower profits after tax from our mexican operations  we estimate the impact the new taxes would have on endeavours annual cash flow assuming the same production costs and metal prices as  will be around  million of extra taxes fortunately the special mining duty and environmental tax are deductible for taxable income calculations so at least we are not getting a double dip  mexico has historically been one of the more attractive jurisdictions in the world for new mine investment based on its combination of political stability good infrastructure low tax rates and attractive mineral potential – all of which drove our decision to make significant investments in mexico over the past  years however this new fiscal policy will significantly impair mexicos competitiveness in the mining world  suffice to say that mexico is no longer the most attractive country for new silver mining investments in the world  endeavour diversified its exploration portfolio by acquiring properties in chile three years ago and management will now turn its focus to mine acquisitions outside of mexico as well  having said that we still enjoy significant competitive advantages in mexico and while endeavour is still interested in finding or buying new mines in mexico they just have to be bigger and better opportunities than we previously considered under the former tax regime  we will continue to reassess the competitiveness of the jurisdictions in which we are willing to invest on an ongoing basis including criteria such as political risk security risk infrastructure mineral potential cost of living and total tax burden     october   q how was endeavour silver able to deliver yet another record quarter of production in q and raise its production guidance for  while simultaneously cutting costs in this difficult price environment a thanks for your question simply put we have a great operating team who consistently meet or beat their targets and q was no exception  there were a number of production variables that we were able to maximize during the quarter at bolañitos we maximized mine production by filling not only the bolañitos plant to capacity but also the leased las torres plant near el cubo until the end of july  after that we moved the extra bolañitos mine production seamlessly over to the newly rebuilt el cubo plant where we have excess capacity at this time  bolañitos production grades were also higher than plan partly due to our conservative reserve estimation at el cubo we completed the reconstruction of the plant and surface infrastructure on time and under budget during q which meant we could optimize the mine and plant performance in q  as a result both production grades and recoveries improved in q in addition el cubo and bolañitos production and recoveries both benefitted from the cleanout of the leased las torres plant before it was returned to the owner in late july as well as the timing of our doré bar pours at the beginning and end of the quarter at guanaceví production grades were above plan thanks to mining more ore from the higher grade porvenir cuatro orebody and metal recoveries benefitted from the timing of our dore bar pours at the beginning and end of the quarter we were able to significantly increase our  production guidance mainly as a result of the outperformance of the bolañitos mine and the operational turnaround of the el cubo mine while the cleanout of the las torres plant was a onetime event it was only responsible for less than half of the extra production in q over q so the majority of our outperformance in q should be sustainable going forward  management has now developed a threeyear growth plan to grow our production by another  over the next three years but we will save that discussion for another time   september   q in this modern age of mining why do fatalities still occur from time to time and what does endeavour do to minimize the risk of fatal or lost time accidents a the reality of mining is that it is inherently an industry that presents risks even with all our modern technology and training it is just not possible to completely eliminate risk or human error we train in hazard identification to eliminate all risks to the best extent possible and therefore our entire system of safety policies practices training meetings reviews incentives audits and performance is based on repetition of best practices we work proactively teaching safety systems job safe procedures the correct use of tools the correct use of personal safety equipment and special permissions for certain work we also work to eliminate dangerous conditions such as potential rock falls through the use of modern technology to support underground tunnels training to check for and safely remove loose rocks and we regularly conduct air quality and ventilation studies we are proud of the achievements our team has made which include winning st nd and rd place at the durango state mine rescue and first aid competitions in  and two casco de plata silver hard hat awards from the mexican chamber of mines camimex in  for notable improvements in safety performance we continue to work toward our objective of a perfect safety record with no lost time accidents working in any mine environment requires training great care and attention and a positive attitude toward safety with a thorough awareness and respect of the underground conditions   august   q endeavour has already produced more than  million ounces of silver in the first six months of  yet your guidance for the full year remains unchanged at  million ounces are you planning to revise this or are you expecting a weaker h a thanks for your question endeavour produced  million oz silver and  oz gold in the first half of  so we are well ahead of our production guidance for the year management normally reviews guidance and revises it if necessary in september each year in the second quarter endeavour completed the el cubo plant reconstruction on time and budget which allowed us to return the leased las torres plant at el cubo to its owner fresnillo plc thereby reducing slightly our total processing capacity although we have stated the second half production may not match the first half production we are encouraged that the bolañitos mine has outperformed expectations and the el cubo mine turnaround is speeding up once we see the august production numbers we will comment on bolañitos and el cubo and our production guidance in september as anticipated   august   q is it true your total cost of production including acquisitionexploration costs is over oz a thanks for your question we have not published our allin cost of production but it can be readily derived from our quarterly financial reports depending on ones assumptions which is the main issue the industry is now trying to address we are working toward incorporating allin sustaining cost aisc reporting into future earnings releases likely in q or q the concept of aisc was developed by the world gold council in response to demands from investors for companies to better define the total costs associated with producing precious metals however the main challenge with the world gold council framework is a lack of clarity on the definitions of sustaining capital and exploration spending and what should or should not be included for example both growth capital and exploration expenditures are discretionary items which rise and fall with the precious metal prices and company profits when metal prices and company profits are up companies typically reinvest more profits to explore and develop new mines and when metal prices and company profits are down like today companies typically reinvest less as you know mines are not sustainable renewable resources they are fixed depleting resources further aisc does not account for acquisition costs development capital interest expenses or taxes given this we are working to develop clear consistent definitions in order to report aisc in a meaningful way   august   q the el cubo mine is still losing money what are you doing to speed up the turnaround and at what point do you say enough is enough and close the mine a thanks for your question it is a good one we are about half way through the two year period we estimated it would take us to effect the operational turnaround at el cubo el cubo made good operating progress in q  and q  with higher production grades and lower operating costs and we substantially completed the capital reconstruction of the plant and surface infrastructure on time and budget in q  the scheduled down time for recommissioning of the newly rebuilt plant resulted in lower production and higher costs in q and we initiated a number of cost cutting measures that should benefit the operation in q the metal prices have fallen so precipitously this year it is clear we need to speed up our turnaround programs to that end management has initiated another round of cost cutting and revenue enhancement at el cubo we appointed a new general manager in july pulled out of the lowest grade stopes and reallocated those crews to higher grade stopes and pushed harder on development to open up new higher grade areas in the mine discovered by exploration in addition we are discussing with the union more layoffs as the mine needs more productivity from fewer employees if the silver price moves above  and we succeed in our latest optimization efforts the mine should return to profitability with no need to close but if the silver price remains below  and our latest turnaround efforts fail then we will have to consider reducing the production to the highest grade stopes and if necessary put the mine on care and maintenance   by

quarter  by published july    am et share jul   marketwired via comtex  vancouver bcmarketwired  july    endeavour silver corp edr exk  reports its production results for the second quarter  from the companys three silvergold mines in mexico the guanaceví mine in durango state and the bolañitos and el cubo mines in guanajuato state silver production in the second quarter  was  ounces oz and gold production was  oz resulting in silver equivalent production of  million oz using a  silver gold ratio production was lower in q  compared to q  due to differences in the annual mine plans last year  production was highest in q and lowest in q due to the decision at low metal prices in january  to cut spending on exploration and development at all three mines which reduced mine access to reserves and therefore reduced metal production in  production was higher in q compared to q due to improved performance of the bolañitos and el cubo mines this year consolidated production should rise from q to q with increased access to reserves due to increased spending on exploration and development at all three mines production highlights for second quarter  compared to second quarter  silver production decreased  to  oz gold production decreased  to  oz silver equivalent production was  million oz at a  silver silver oz sold down  to  oz gold oz sold down  to  oz bullion inventory at quarterend included  oz silver and  oz gold concentrate inventory at quarterend included  oz silver and  oz gold endeavour ceo bradford cooke commented our second quarter production was an improvement over the first quarter thanks to higher tonnes andor grades from the bolañitos and el cubo mines both mines are now performing in line with their operating plans for the year the guanaceví mine continues to lag behind plan and an internal review has been initiated in order to identify additional actions needed to improve tonnes andor grades and production we recently made a decision to develop el compas as our fourth mine and work is now under way on developing the mine ramp to access the orebodies we also received notice of approval for our mine and plant permits from semarnat last week to build terronera into our fifth mine the semarnat and conagua waste dumps and tailings area permits for terronera are expected later this year at guanaceví slower mine development due to narrower vein widths than in the resource model resulted in lower mine output than planned while excess dilution of the ore resulted in lower than planned grades management has initiated an internal review of the guanaceví mine plan and reserve estimate to better understand the variance in production compared to plan in recent months over the past year management has implemented operational changes and made investments to improve the pumping ventilation and electrical systems at guanaceví to remediate the operational challenges encountered in the second half of  and first half of  at bolañitos silver grades improved but remained below plan due to grade variations in the llasunción vein the lower silver grades were offset by higher throughput than planned gold production exceeded plan due to higher throughput and gold grades at el cubo both silver and gold grades were higher than plan and throughput was slightly below plan during the quarter management made changes to both mining methods and ore control processes to reduce the dilution and provide highergrade material to the plant grades are expected to stabilize and throughput should regain plan through yearend

attention turns to growth the emergence of our exciting new terronera discovery and the acquisition of two attractive projects last year el compas and parral have positioned us for significant growth over the next three years which we think could coincide with rising precious metal prices we believe now is the right time to invest for the future across our portfolioin particular the company continues to advance the preliminary economic assessment pea and initial resource estimate for the el compas project in zacatecas state and the prefeasibility study pfs and updated reserveresource estimate for the terronera project in jalisco state for completion in march the el compas pea is somewhat dependent on the outcome of appeals by several industries of the recently amended revenue law in the state of zacatecas the amendment to the revenue law is effectively a new environmental tax on the extraction of rock sand and similar materials the pollution of air soil and water and the disposal of wastes including all mill tailings and heap leach pads however mining companies already pay a federal environmental tax and the company has received legal advice that the amended state revenue law is unconstitutional so endeavour and many other companies plan to file constitutional challenges in the mexican courts the amendment went into effect as of january   and could make the el compas project and every other mine in the state uneconomic high level discussions are now underway between the affected industries in zacatecas and state and federal government officials to repeal or amend this lawat guanaceví production will be similar to  based on slightly lower grades and higher throughputs of  to  tonnes per day tpd primarily from the santa cruz porvenir norte and porvenir
