modified organism – often refers to ingredient materials that have been altered by using genesplicing techniques in order to introduce a desirable trait a broad range of health professionals and scientists including the us national academy of sciences the us food and drug administration the american medical association and the world health organization agree that the genetically modified foods and ingredients currently available and on the market today are safe to consume what does nongmo mean there is no single accepted definition for the term nongmo mead johnson uses the term nongmo to mean that the ingredients have come from sources that have not been genetically engineered or created through biotechnologygene splicing how are you able to assure that your products are nongmo we work with our suppliers to confirm that the ingredients they supply for these nongmo enfamil® products have come from nongmo sources – which means the source of the ingredient is not genetically engineered what does the disclosure regarding the potential for the presence of trace amounts of genetically engineered material in the products mean we work with our suppliers to source nongmo ingredients for our formulas however there are a number of ways that trace amounts of genetically engineered materials often referred to as gmo might be present in our products such as manufacturing proximity fermentation and processing aids or enzymes used in production mead johnson takes steps to limit the potential for the inadvertent introduction of genetically engineered materials material during our production processes such as segregating nongmo ingredients and flushing or cleaning the production lines before nongmo formulations are manufactured but mead johnson recognizes that our efforts and those of our suppliers cannot ensure the complete absence of genetically engineered materials it is also important to note that almost all animal feed in the us is genetically modified which means that dairyderived ingredients in our nongmo products are likely to come from animals that were given some feed that was made with genetically engineered materials this is common in many other nongmo foods are your nongmo products safer or more nutritious than your other enfamil products no our enfamil premium newborn enfamil premium infant enfamil premium gentlease enfagrow premium toddler transitions and enfagrow premium toddler next step have the same nutritious and highquality ingredients as existing enfamil newborn enfamil infant enfamil gentlease and enfagrow toddler next

after  revenue advanced at the slowest pace in more than five years amid tough conditions in europe and emerging markets like brazil a  million breakup fee reduces the chance of a counteroffer for mead johnson which has been touted as a takeover candidate since the maker of enfamil went public in  “this deal has potential to reignite topline growth the only area where the reckitt model appears lacking” said deborah aitken an analyst at bloomberg intelligencesales slowdownthe acquisition marks an “inflection point” for reckitt benckiser chief executive officer rakesh kapoor said at a press conference he cited urbanization changes to china’s onechild policy and increasing rates of women entering the workforce as reasons for entering the infant nutrition market which he sees growing at

expectations likeforlike sales growth of  percent compared with a companycompiled consensus estimate of  percent fullyear operating profit was in line with estimates at  percent of salesthe uk company also forecast  percent growth in likeforlike sales this year below analyst estimates for a gain of about  percent the first quarter has been weighed down by a new product in the scholl footcare line that failed to live up to expectations and will be a drag on performance through the first half of the year kapoor said“in  we expect macro conditions to remain challenging and for a number of existing headwinds to persist in the first half” the ceo said in a statementalthough not previously considered by analysts to be an obvious acquirer of mead johnson reckitt benckiser has had the us company on its radar for a number of years kapoor said friday on a conference callthe purchase will add baby formula to a portfolio of consumer brands that include nurofen painkillers strepsils throat lozenges and french’s mustard reckitt benckiser has proven able to enter and thrive in new categories before as it did when it acquired durex condom maker ssl international plc in  and it already has a toe in the nutrition business from its  purchase of schiff nutrition which makes omega supplements and jointpain pillsasia attractionsone of the main reasons for the takeover is to increase reckitt

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by
