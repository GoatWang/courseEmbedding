diagnosis of cancer and other diseases our experienced pathologists deliver comprehensive diagnostic reports of a patients condition and consult frequently with referring physicians to help determine the appropriate treatment our diagnostic reports often enable the early detection of disease allowing referring physicians to make informed and timely treatment decisions that improve their patients health in a costeffective manner through our pathologistoperated laboratory practices we provide physicianbased general anatomic and clinical pathology dermatopathology molecular diagnostic services and other esoteric testing services to physicians hospitals clinical laboratories and surgery centers our operations consist of one reportable segment emerging growth company we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  jobs act as an emerging growth company we are subject to reduced reporting and other obligations generally applicable to public companies including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting in addition we may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies the information that we provide may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies due to these reduced reporting burdens    recent developments health care regulatory and reimbursement changes in the  final physician fee schedule rule cms calculated the  conversion factor using the sustainable growth rate method or sgr the new conversion factor for  represented a  percent reduction from the  conversion factor on december   congress passed legislation that enacted a  percent increase in the conversion factor which was effective through march   on april   president obama signed the protecting access to medicare act of  or pama pama extended the  percent increase through march   and made other changes to laboratory reimbursement discussed below on april   president obama signed the medicare and chip reauthorization act macra which had previously been passed by both houses of congress macra repealed the provisions related to the medicare sgr formula and implements a new physician payment system that is designed to reward the quality of care in addition it extends the current medicare physician fee schedule rates through june  and then increases them by  percent for the remainder of  beginning on january   the rates will be increased annually by  percent through  for  through  payments will be frozen although payment will be adjusted to account for performance on certain quality metrics under the meritbased incentive payment systems mips or to reflect physician participation in alternative payment models apms for  and subsequent years qualified apm participants receive an annual  update on medicare physician payment rates while those not participating receive a  annual payment update plus any applicable mipsbased payment adjustments at this time it is too early to determine how these changes may impact our business beyond  in the  physician fee schedule rule cms also changed cpt codes for certain stains we commonly use and reduced the rvus related to those codes these changes as well as other limits on other commonlyused cpt codes resulted in decreased medicare reimbursement for some of our services we estimated the changes to the  physician fee schedule resulted in a reduction of our annualized medicare revenue of approximately  million we have experienced isolated reductions in reimbursement from nongovernmental thirdparty payors tied to the medicare reductions however at this time we are unable to predict the extent to which nongovernmental thirdparty payors will seek to reduce our reimbursement rates as a result of reductions in medicares physician fee schedule in the  physician fee rule cms enacted additional payment changes although it had indicated previously that it considered flow cytometry a test that we commonly bill to be potentially misvalued and therefore overpaid cms did not change the payment for that code in the final rule cms did however change how it pays for prostate biopsy codes which is also a test that we bill relatively often and stated that it did consider that code to be potentially misvalued in addition it made substantial reductions in certain other codes including the codes applicable to fish fluorescent in situ hybridization which we also bill however our analysis suggests that those cuts will be offset by the increases in other codes including cpt  which is the most common code that we bill cms also stated that it does not intend to implement the policy that it proposed in the  proposed fee schedule rule that would have limited certain physician payments to the amounts paid in the hospital setting finally cms announced that it is withdrawing its authority to amend laboratory rates to reflect technological changes as mandated by pama overall based on our historical product mix we expect the changes to have a net positive impact of about  on our  revenues however our product mix payor mix and volume may change and the actual impact of the changes to the  physician fee rule may vary significantly from our estimates this does not reflect any potential change that congress might make in the future with regard to the conversion factor    results of operations the following table outlines our results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended march   and  three months ended march    net revenue     operating costs and expenses cost of

was  million on accession volume of  inclusive of  million of revenue and  accessions from labs acquired in  net revenue at existing labs decreased by  percent or approximately  million to approximately  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million for the quarter ended march   same lab accession volume decreased by  percent to  for the quarter ended march   compared to  for the quarter ended march   primarily related to client attrition the decrease in volume for the quarter resulted in approximately  million lower net revenue the average revenue per accession for the quarter ended march   increased by approximately  to  for our existing labs from approximately  in the quarter ended march   representing an increase of approximately  million in revenue the increase in average revenue per accession and corresponding net revenue compared to the same quarter in  was due primarily to changes in payor and product mix approximately  million higher revenue from the aurora research institute which specializes in providing paraffin blocks and fresh tissue to pharmaceutical and research companies conducting research studies and higher revenue from medicare we have estimated the changes to the  physician fee schedule represent an increase to our annualized medicare revenue of approximately  million furthermore our average revenue per accession fluctuates as a result of changes in service mix including the conversion of global fee arrangements to technical component tc or professional component pc arrangements and changes in test volume for womens health pathology services and clinical tests womens health services and clinical tests generally have lower revenue per accession and therefore may further decrease our average revenue per accession conversely a higher volume of molecular testing may increase our average revenue per accession in addition our growth rates and average revenue per accession may be positively or negatively impacted by the reimbursement market and our service mix    effective january   we adjusted the way we count our accession volume to better reflect our revenue per accession accession counts for all prior periods have been revised to reflect our current methodology cost of services cost of services for the quarter ended march   was  million including  million for labs acquired in  cost of services at existing labs increased approximately  million or  percent to  million for the quarter ended march   from  million for the quarter ended march   primarily as a result of higher payroll for physicians

quarter ended march   compared to  percent for the quarter ended march   gross margin was  percent for the quarter ended march   compared to  percent for the quarter ended march   cost of services and our related gross profit percentages may be positively or negatively impacted by market conditions and our service mix to better reflect their correlation to revenue certain expenses in  have been reclassified from selling general and administrative to cost of services selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately  million or  percent to  million for the quarter ended march   from  million for the quarter ended march   compared to the corresponding period in the prior year selling general and administrative expenses at corporate increased by approximately  million primarily due to travel expenses for management meetings held during the quarter ended march   partially offset by lower insurance costs selling general

accounts increased approximately  million or  percent to  million for the quarter ended march   from  million for the quarter ended march   as a percentage of net revenue the provision for doubtful accounts increased to  percent for the quarter ended march   compared to  percent for the quarter ended march   the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts corresponds to an increased proportion of our accounts receivable from patients the companys consolidated provision for doubtful accounts could be positively or negatively impacted by various factors including among other things changes in payor mix and the provision for doubtful accounts for laboratories that we acquire intangible asset amortization expense amortization expense increased to  million for the quarter ended march   from  million for the quarter ended march   as a result of amortization of finite lived intangible assets recorded in  acquisitions we generally amortize our intangible assets over lives ranging from  to  years management fees management fees were approximately  million for each of the quarters ended march   and  management fees are based on  percent of net revenue plus expenses acquisition and business development costs transaction costs associated with our completed acquisitions and business development costs related to our prospecting and acquisition activity was approximately  million for each of the quarters ended march   and march      change in fair value of contingent consideration for each of the quarters ended march   and march   we recorded noncash expense of  million for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisitions the change in fair value of contingent consideration results from revisions in our projections to reflect recent results as well as other variables such as the discount rate the valuation date and actual payments made interest expense interest expense increased by approximately  million to  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million for the quarter ended march   the increase in interest expense resulted from approximately  million higher average debt balances

primarily financed operations through capital contributions from our equityholders long term debt financing and cash flow from operations we require significant cash flow to service our debt obligations the reductions in medicare reimbursement for  and  and the corresponding reduction in reimbursement from nongovernmental payors have had a significant negative impact on our cash flows as

available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through  in order to access the amounts available under our revolving credit facility we must meet the financial tests and ratios contained in our senior secured credit facility our management currently expects to meet these financial tests and ratios at least through the end of  we may undertake acquisitions which our management believes would add to earnings and performance with respect to the credit facility covenants nonetheless we may not achieve all of our business goals and objectives and events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests and ratios and limit our ability to access the amounts otherwise available under our revolving credit
