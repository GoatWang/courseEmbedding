investment strategiesthe firm our approach alternative investments mutual funds contact us alternative investments what are alternative investment strategies liquid alternatives why alternative investments alternative investments numerous studies have shown that alternative investments create the potential to increase an investment portfolio’s return while reducing its volatility two key factors highlight why alternative investment strategies are an attractive addition to an investment portfolio the potential for low correlations with traditional asset classes the flexible investment mandate whereby the goal of the manager is to generate positive returns rather than compete against a benchmark or peer group however because of their extremely high minimum investment requirements and limited liquidity alternative strategies have not been easily accessible to most individual investors with a growing interest in employing alternative strategies and with increasing albeit limited options today to the average investor there is a tremendous need to offer liquid alternative investment products to advisers in a userfriendly construct to allow them to appropriately add value to their clients’ portfolios lowering a portfolio’s overall volatility can create greater wealth over time by a allowing the power of compounding to work more effectively and b mitigating the behavioral challenges facing investors to allow them to adhere to their plan and longer term objectives green box we believe investors are looking for a better way to gain true diversification   orinda asset

strategiesthe firm our approach alternative investments mutual funds contact us alternative investments what are alternative investment strategies liquid alternatives why alternative investments liquid alternatives liquid alternative investment strategies may be viewed in two subsets—a hedgedopportunistic style and an absolute return approach hedgedopportunistic managers may specialize in sectors geography capitalization etc and will be active in managing the fund’s ‘net’ exposure to take advantage of evolving market opportunities the style tends to incorporate either a qualitative or quantitative approach to capital allocation and may employ a more ‘macro’ perspective to portfolio construction and management this approach will tend to have greater volatility than absolute return strategies and may have at times more inherent directional exposure but should offer reduced volatility and potentially greater downside protection than traditional longonly strategies there is a greater dependency on the portfolio manager’s ability to effectively set market or net exposure appropriate to a given investment environment absolute return managers utilize investment and risk management skills to generate positive absolute returns ie seek a rate of return objective usually with a goal of –bp in excess of the riskfree rate regardless of the underlying direction of markets the performance of these strategies is generally independent of the underlying trend of the asset markets they are exposed to some of these strategies are ‘transactionspecific’ rather than market related—returns are driven by manager skill and tend to be largely uncorrelated with the general market direction   orinda asset management llcwordpress website by hyperartshomeour approachalternative
