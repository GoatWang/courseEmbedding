hardcover  pages isbn  march   £ other formats available ebook version for professors request  a desk copy rights information permissions rightslink foreign  other subsidiary rights description author bio reviews in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries more than a thousand pirates poured from the atlantic into the indian ocean there according to kevin p mcdonald they helped launch an informal trade network that spanned the atlantic and indian ocean worlds connecting the north american colonies with the rich markets of the east indies rather than conducting their commerce through chartered companies based in london or lisbon colonial merchants in new york entered into an alliance with euroamerican pirates based in madagascar pirates merchants settlers and slaves explores the resulting global trade network located on the peripheries of world empires and shows the illicit ways american colonists met the consumer demand for slaves and east india goods the book reveals that pirates played a significant yet misunderstood role in this period and that seafaring slaves were both commodities and essential components in the indoatlantic maritime networks enlivened by stories of indoatlantic sailors and cargoes that included textiles spices jewels and precious metals chinaware alcohol and drugs this book links previously isolated themes of piracy colonialism slavery transoceanic networks and crosscultural interactions and extends the boundaries of traditional atlantic national world and colonial histories kevin p mcdonald is assistant professor of history at loyola marymount university in los angeles extremely well researched—american historical reviewmcdonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the british atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—humanities and social sciencemcdonald uses his case study to great effect demonstrating the ways that pirates connected colonial america to a much wider world he introduces a new category of analysis the indoatlantic world and identifies a key facet of the history of piracy that has received too little attention from previous scholars perhaps the most important contribution is it shines light on the neglected but critical last decades of the seventeenth century—the william and mary quarterlyit will change how scholars of seventeenthcentury colonial america make sense of the relationship between law commerce and culture in the atlantic world and beyond    breaks new ground by establishing that piratical activity was diverse widespread and seasonal    mcdonald has done a remarkable job marshaling primary sources from archives in the united kingdom and the united states in support of his ambitious argument    mcdonald has written an important and powerful book that will make a substantial impact on the historiography of early american commerce—journal of american historymcdonald’s book is the most globalminded of the three books reviewed and his explicit intellectual engagement with world history as a way of understanding free and unfree migration patterns as well as maritime and trade circuits is refreshing   an excellent teaching resource   the whole book is ideal for classroom use—reviews in american historymcdonald’s carefully researched and crisplywritten book makes a number of important interventions in its field enhancing our appreciation of the vital connections between the colonial atlantic and the emerging company state in india by demonstrating the scope of colonial autonomy and the corresponding limits of the british imperial state and by revealing the extent to which imperial rivalry shaped and disrupted a set of global frontiers and zones of interaction pirates did not merely act as plunderers and despoilers but were as vital in shaping a series of economic and cultural peripheries and integrating them into an emerging global order—international journal of maritime historythe book is well written and tells a captivating story—journal of colonialism and colonial historymcdonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the british atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one that extends—through madagascar—to the indian ocean he demonstrates that contemporary englishmen’s horizons were broader than those of most historians of the british atlantic this is an eyeopening and enlightening contribution which requires other scholars to reframe their histories and periodizations including such concepts as “first” and “second” british empires—hwara thoughtprovoking book that will register with both scholars and students of earlymodern atlantic and indian ocean studies   mcdonald’s analysis of    the pirateslave trade nexus contributes to the growing body of literature that argues piracy contributed to the emergence of seventeenthcentury merchant capitalism rather than undermined it   a fascinating work of history that uncovers how diverse pursuits   served to interlock distant and relatively small maritime communities across the globe at the end of the seventeenth century   a wonderful addition and   a sophisticated analysis—international review of social historya highly readable and important contribution to our understanding of pirates’ role in colonial projects in both the americas and madagascar   sheds much needed light on the madagascar slave trade and the subsequent malagasy diaspora   deserves high praise for providing a fresh perspective on indian ocean pirates their settlement of st mary’s on madagascar and their participation in the malagasy slave trade—journal of world history in this fascinating book kevin mcdonald tells the story of how pirates helped turn one imperial periphery colonial new york into a hub of the indoatlantic trade world with a network that stretched from manhattan to madagascar new york–backed sea rovers helped open the indian ocean to the colony’s merchants carried slaves to north america and the caribbean and made spectacular fortunes carefully researched beautifully written and smartly argued pirates merchants settlers and slaves is maritime history at its best —eliga gould author of among the powers of the earth the american revolution and the making of a new world empire beautifully written and well researched pirates merchants settlers and slaves promises to make a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of pirate studies linking the atlantic world and the indian ocean mcdonald shows how pirates expanded their reach to madagascar and beyond after they were driven from the atlantic settlements this work captures pirates and piracy in their various contexts complicating the story we all thought we knew so well—carla gardina pestana professor and joyce appleby endowed chair of

researched pirates merchants settlers and slaves promises to make a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of pirate studies linking the atlantic world and the indian ocean mcdonald shows

all thought we knew so wellcarla gardina pestana professor and joyce appleby endowed chair of america in the world department of history university of california los angelesshow more review quote extremely well researched american historical review mcdonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the british atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries humanities and social science mcdonald uses his case study to great effect demonstrating the ways that pirates connected colonial america to a much wider world he introduces a new category of analysis the indoatlantic world and identifies a key facet of the history of piracy that has received too little attention from previous scholars perhaps the most important contribution is it shines light on the neglected but critical last decades of the seventeenth century the william and mary quarterly it will change how scholars of seventeenthcentury colonial america make sense of the relationship between law commerce and culture in the atlantic world and beyond  breaks new ground by establishing that piratical activity was diverse widespread and seasonal  mcdonald has done a remarkable job marshaling primary sources from archives in the united kingdom and the united states in support of his ambitious argument  mcdonald has written an important and powerful book that will make a substantial impact on the historiography of early american commerce journal of american history mcdonalds book is the most globalminded of the three books reviewed and his explicit intellectual engagement with world history as a way of understanding free and unfree migration patterns as well as maritime and trade circuits is refreshing an excellent teaching resource the whole book is ideal for classroom use reviews in american history mcdonalds carefully researched and crisplywritten book makes a number of important interventions in its field enhancing our appreciation of the vital connections between the colonial atlantic and the emerging company state in india by demonstrating the scope of colonial autonomy and the corresponding limits of the british imperial state and by revealing the extent to which imperial rivalry shaped and disrupted a set of global frontiers and zones of interaction pirates did not merely act as plunderers and despoilers but were as vital in shaping a series of economic and cultural peripheries and integrating them into an emerging global order international journal of maritime history the book is well written and tells a captivating story journal of colonialism and colonial history mcdonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the british atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one that extendsthrough madagascarto the indian ocean he demonstrates that contemporary englishmens horizons were broader than those of most historians of the british atlantic this is an eyeopening and enlightening contribution which requires other scholars to reframe their histories and periodizations including such concepts as first and second british empires hwar a thoughtprovoking book that will register with both scholars and students of earlymodern atlantic and indian ocean studies mcdonalds analysis of  the pirateslave trade nexus contributes to the growing body of literature that argues piracy contributed to the emergence of seventeenthcentury merchant capitalism rather than undermined it a fascinating work of history that uncovers how diverse pursuits served to interlock distant and relatively small maritime communities across the globe at the end of the seventeenth century a wonderful addition and a sophisticated analysis international review of social history a highly readable and important contribution to our understanding of pirates role in colonial projects in both the americas and madagascar sheds much needed light on the madagascar slave trade and the subsequent malagasy diaspora deserves high praise for providing a fresh perspective on indian ocean pirates their settlement of st marys on madagascar and their participation in the malagasy slave trade journal of world historyshow more rating details  ratings  out of

french and dutch vessels to madagascar throughout this period european ships spent months at sea in the atlantic and indian oceans but until now scholars have not fully examined how crews were fed during these long voyages without sustenance from madagascar european traders would have struggled to transport silver to asia and spices back to europe colonies in mozambique mauritius and at the cape relied upon frequent imports from madagascar to feed settlers and slaves in feeding globalization jane hooper draws on challenging and previously untapped sources to analyze madagascar’s role in provisioning european trading networks within and ultimately beyond the indian ocean the sale of food from the island not only shaped trade routes and colonial efforts but also encouraged political centralization and the slave trade in madagascar malagasy people played an essential role in supporting european global commerce with farreaching effects on their communities feeding globalization reshapes our understanding of indian ocean and global history by insisting historians should pay attention to the role that food played in supporting other exchanges    more from author preordered
