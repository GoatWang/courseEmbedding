beat the market” source thestreet  roger g ibbotson phd chairman and chief investment officer zebra capital management professor emeritus yale school of management founder of ibbotson associates now a morningstar company the nyse® zebra edge® index an opportunity to benefit from unpopular stocks since  roger ibbotson has conducted groundbreaking research on asset allocation and investment strategies his fourdecade teaching career with the university of chicago and yale university includes numerous awards and placed him among a select group of academics who have helped change the way investors think his daring prediction — largecap stock returns over  annually would lead to the dow breaking  — made him one of the most famous names in finance professor ibbotson and his team at zebra capital management now bring that wealth of experience to the design of the new nyse® zebra edge® index this dynamic index capitalizes on the core insight of his career stocks historically have provided higher returns than bonds the nyse® zebra edge® index is a rulesbased riskcontrolled index which leverages ibbotson’s behavioral research less popular and less volatile stocks provide the potential for consistent longterm returns helpful resources nyse® zebra edge index® ibbotson’s cool stock selection process the nyse® zebra edge® index evaluates the  largest publicly traded companies in the united states each quarter and removes the most popular and the most volatile the diagram below shows how every three months the nyse® zebra edge® index selects on average  stocks with the potential for higher returns with less risk nyse® then applies a risk control methodology that makes daily adjustments to the allocations between the selected cool stocks us treasuries and an interestfree cash account this daily reallocation further reduces risk when markets are volatile moving rapidly up or down key terms cool stocks – stocks that have been less frequently traded over the last two years and have had lower volatility over the last three months and one year hot stocks – stocks that have been the most frequently traded over the last two years and have had higher volatility over the last three months and one year popularity – the tendency for some stocks to be traded more frequently than others because of name recognition or other factors volatility – the daily price changes in a stock up or down which historically has been an indication of risk the power of selecting the cool stocks while cool stocks often include lesser known companies ibbotson and his team at zebra capital management have found that on average they also had a tendency to provide higher longterm returns hot stocks often include wellknown brand names and in general had a tendency to experience higher volatility the table below lists some examples of cool and hot stocks hot and cool stocks based on the quarterly selection in november  this is not a complete list of the selected stocks which may change each selection and is not a recommendation to buy or sell any individual stock the potential benefit of avoiding hot stocks over time the nyse® zebra edge® index’s approach of selecting the cool stocks would have provided a higher average annual return than the hot stocks that were eliminated nyse® zebra edge® index  annual return hot stocks  annual return performance

independent investment management firm managing equityfocused investment strategies founded in  by roger ibbotson professor emeritus of finance at yale university zebra has successfully combined his leadingedge research and scientific methods with decades of direct trading risk management and operational experience zebras strategies seek to generate superior performance without incurring additional volatility early in his career professor roger ibbotson realized that for different asset classes — like stocks bonds and cash — more risk generally offers more return when he looked specifically at stocks the relationship wasn’t there — riskier stocks did not offer higher returns ibbotson found his answer in popularity the most popular and frequently traded stocks tend to provide below average returns ibbotson believed that stocks that were less popular had a better opportunity for returns the nyse zebra edge index “the zebra index” is designed by ibbotson and his team at zebra capital to leverage the opportunity of less popular stocks and provide an opportunity for consistent longterm returns through bull and bear markets key terms cool stocks – stocks that have experienced lower trading frequency over the last two years and lower volatility over the last three months and one year hot stocks – stocks that have experienced the highest trading frequency over

exclusively available with the nationwide new heights® fixed index annuities in partnership with ubs and annexus video the launch of zebra edge index listen to zebra capital management llc founder and chief investment officer roger ibbotson discuss the new zebra edge index watch now qaroger ibbotson founder and chief investment officer of zebra capital tell us about the nyse zebra edge index you know all of the things are connected or combined together for me because all of my life i’ve been putting together academic thought and with it its implementation into practical investments and so we developed the nyse zebra edge indices for the express purpose of capturing ways to get higher returns with lower volatility how does your recent research into “popularity” relate to your stocks and bonds research i’ve done a lot of work over the years on stocks bonds and bills of inflation – or sbbi – studying the risk and return relationships and how the long term equity markets have performed popularity actually adds a whole new dimension to this because in the case of popularity we are looking at ways to actually get higher returns with lower volatility so this is a great way to mix the two lines of work for me tell us about popularity can you define that for us popularity is avoiding the hot stocks and actually considering those cool stocks the problem with those hot stocks is they’re too popular and being too popular that means that we get too excited about them and they end up being too overpriced really how do you measure popularity we measure popularity by looking at how much interest how much tangible interest is in a stock and you can see this by the trading volume stocks that trade too much are too popular and tend to be too highly priced does popularity apply to all markets even international markets popularity applies to all types of markets – many types of stock and bond markets real estate anything anything that gets too popular – that people get too excited about – that may end up with too high of a price we’ve specifically looked at a lot of international stock markets and i have to say that in almost every country that we looked at the stocks that have a higher trading volume actually have lower returns how does it feel to be here at the new york stock exchange its really exciting to be on the floor of the new york stock exchange where i’ll be ringing the bell and its especially interesting because the ringing of the bell will be connected with our new product launch the nyse zebra edge indicesjohn j holmgren president of zebra capitalwhat do you think increased interest of “smart beta” strategies investors are investing in smart beta to capture longterm premiums and the way theyre doing that is looking at existing traditional indices that are capweighted reweighting based upon the factor that they want to identify or they want to get the return from the problem is that the factors become popular or the premiums become popular and people invest in what’s popular the key to success in investing in these types of strategies is to invest in the less popular premiums—typically they’re underpriced why are you excited to be here today the nyse zebra edge equity indices are designed to capture the popularity premium while maintaining a low volatility profile we’re very excited about doing these as it’s the

the benefits of unpopular stocks the fund’s manager seeks out less popular stocks among smallcapitalization equities taking positions in companies that have strong fundamentals but do not trade as frequently as similar issues less popular stocks can often capture a “liquidity premium” defined as the additional return that may be realized on the sales of securities that are less liquid at the time of purchase the manager’s research shows that highly traded more liquid stocks tend to be priced at a premium while less popular and less liquid stocks are priced at a discount thus having higher
