started   page not found error   page not found why am i seeing this page  means the file is not found if you have already uploaded the file then the name may be misspelled or it is in a different folder other possible causes you may get a  error for images because you have hot link protection turned on and the domain is not on the list of authorized domains if you go to your temporary url httpipusername and get this error there maybe a problem with the rule set stored in an htaccess file you can try renaming that file to htaccessbackup and refreshing the site to see if that resolves the issue it is also possible that you have inadvertently deleted your document root or the your account may need to be recreated either way please contact your web host immediately are you using wordpress see the section on  errors after clicking a link in wordpress how to find the correct spelling and folder missing or broken files when you get a  error be sure to check the url that you are attempting to use in your browserthis tells the server what resource it should attempt to request httpexamplecomexampleexamplehelphtml in this example the file must be in publichtmlexampleexample

can often occur when a new theme has been activated or when the rewrite rules in the htaccess file have been altered when you encounter a  error in wordpress you have two options for correcting it option  correct the permalinks log in to wordpress from the lefthand navigation menu in wordpress click settings  permalinks note the current setting if you are using a custom structure copy or save the custom structure somewhere select  default click save settings change the settings back to the previous configuration before you selected default put the custom structure back if you had one click save settings this will reset the permalinks and fix the issue in many cases if this doesnt work you may need to edit your htaccess file directly option  modify the htaccess file add the following snippet of code to the top of your htaccess file  begin wordpress ifmodule modrewritec rewriteengine on rewritebase  rewriterule indexphp  l rewritecond  d rewriterule  indexphp l ifmodule  end wordpress if your blog is showing the wrong domain name in links redirecting to another site or is missing images and style these are all usually related to the same problem you have the wrong domain name configured in your wordpress blog how to modify your htaccess file the htaccess file contains directives instructions that tell the server how to behave in certain scenarios and directly affect how your website functions redirects and rewriting urls are two very common directives found in a htaccess file and many scripts such as wordpress drupal joomla and magento add directives to the htaccess so those scripts can function it is possible that you may need to edit the htaccess file at some point for various reasonsthis section covers how to edit the file in cpanel but not what
