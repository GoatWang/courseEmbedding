further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   summary of the application  applicants request an order that would permit the applicants to participate in an interfund lending facility where each fund could lend money directly to and borrow money directly from other funds to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as unanticipated redemptions or trade fails the funds will not borrow under the facility for leverage purposes and the loans duration will be no more than  days  applicants anticipate that the proposed facility would provide a borrowing fund with a source of liquidity at a rate lower than the bank borrowing rate at times when the cash position of the fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements or certain other shortterm money market instruments thus applicants assert that the facility would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application among others an adviser through a designated committee would administer the facility as a disinterested fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management and administrative agreements with the funds and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services in connection with the administration of the facility the facility would be subject to oversight and certain approvals by the funds board including among others approval of the interest rate formula and of the method for allocating loans across funds as well as review of the process in place to evaluate the liquidity implications for the funds a funds aggregate outstanding interfund loans will not exceed  of its net assets and the funds loans to any one fund will not exceed  of the lending funds net assets  applicants assert that the facility does not raise the concerns underlying section d of the act given that the funds are part of the same group of investment companies and there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds applicants also assert that the proposed transactions do not raise the concerns underlying sections a a d and b of the act as the funds would not engage in lending transactions that unfairly benefit insiders or are detrimental to the funds applicants state that the facility will offer both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating funds and each fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms based on an interest rate formula that is objective and verifiable with respect to the relief from section a of the act applicants note that any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing if the lender is another fund or the same or better conditions in any other circumstance  applicants also believe that the limited relief from section f of the act that is necessary to implement the facility because the lending funds are not banks is appropriate in light of the conditions and safeguards described in the application and because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of a fund including combined interfund loans and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage  section c of the act permits the commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the act if such exemption is necessary or start printed page appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors section b of the act authorizes the commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section a if it finds that a the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act rule db under the act provides that in passing upon an application filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of the registered investment company in a joint enterprise joint arrangement or profit sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other
