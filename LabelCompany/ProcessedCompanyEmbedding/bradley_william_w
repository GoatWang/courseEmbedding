presidential election an active boy scout he became an eagle scout and member of the order of the arrow “ bradley must surely be the only great basketball player who wintered regularly in palm beach until he was thirteen years old ” — the new yorker  bradley began playing basketball at the age of nine he was a star at crystal city high school where he scored  points in his scholastic career was twice named allamerican and was elected to the missouri association of student councils he received  college scholarship offers although he applied to only five schools and only scored a  out of  on

decision outside of basketball bradley decided to enroll at princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or united states foreign service work he had been awarded a scholarship at duke but not at princeton the ivy league does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships and bradleys familys wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid bradleys childhood hero dick kazmaier had won the heisman trophy at princeton and he wore  in his honor in his freshman year bradley averaged more than  points per game for the freshman team at one point making  consecutive free throws breaking a record set by a member of the nbas syracuse nationals the following year as a sophomore he was a varsity starter in butch van breda kolffs first year as coach of the tigers in

basketball ability benefited from his height— in the th grade  in the th grade and his adult size of  by the age of —and unusually wide peripheral vision which he worked to improve by focusing on faraway objects while walking during his high school years bradley maintained a rigorous practice schedule a habit he carried through college he would work on the court for three and a half hours every day after school nine to five on saturday onethirty to five on sunday and in the summer about three hours a day he put ten pounds of lead slivers in his sneakers set up chairs as opponents and

duke but not at princeton the ivy league does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships and bradleys familys wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid bradleys childhood hero dick kazmaier had won the heisman trophy at princeton and he wore  in his honor in his freshman year bradley averaged more than  points per game for the freshman team at one point making  consecutive

attempted   ivy league season records he holds similarly include total and average points   and most free throws made  in  attempts  – he also holds the career point record at princeton and many other school records including the top ten slots in the category of total points scored in a game but likely could have scored many more points if he had not insisted so often on passing the ball in what his coaches called bradleys hope passes to inferior teammates closer to the basket he only emphasized his own scoring when princeton was behind or as during the wichita state game his teammates forced bradley to shoot by returning passes to him van breda kolff often encouraged bradley to be more of a one on one player stating that bill is not hungry at least ninety percent of the time when he gets

encouraged to seek the democratic nomination for president but he declined to enter the race saying that he would know when he was ready in  a controversy over a state income tax increase—on which he refused to take a position—and his proposal on merit pay for teachers which led the njea to support his opponent turned his onceobscure rival for the senate christine todd whitman into a viable candidate and bradley won by only a slim margin in  he announced he would not run for reelection publicly declaring american politics broken while he was a senator bradley walked the beaches from cape may to sandy hook a fourday mile trip each labor day weekend to assess beach and ocean conditions and talk with constituents bradley was criticized for neglecting constituent services while in office presidential candidateedit see also bill bradley presidential campaign  bill bradley for president campaign logo used in various materials in  and  bradley ran in the  presidential primaries opposing incumbent vice president al gore for his partys nomination bradley campaigned as the liberal alternative to gore taking positions to the left of gore on a number of issues including universal health care gun control and campaign finance reform on the issue of taxes bradley trumpeted his sponsorship of the tax reform act of  which had significantly cut tax rates while abolishing dozens of loopholes he voiced his belief that the best possible tax code would be one with low rates and no loopholes but he refused to rule out the idea of raising taxes to pay for his health care program calling the idea of such a pledge dishonest on public education he proposed to make over  billion in block grants available to each state every year he further promised to bring  new teachers into the education system in hardtostaff areas over ten years by offering college scholarships to anyone who agreed to become a teacher after graduating gore offered a similar proposal bradley also made child poverty a significant issue in his campaign he promised to address the minimum wage expand the earned income tax credit allow single parents on welfare to keep their child support payments make the dependent care tax credit refundable build support homes for pregnant teenagers enroll  more children in head start and increase the availability of food stamps although gore was considered the party favorite bradley received a number of highprofile endorsements including senators paul wellstone bob kerrey and daniel patrick moynihan former secretary of labor robert reich former new york city mayor ed koch former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and basketball stars michael jordan and phil jackson bradley and jackson have been close friends since they were teammates playing for the new york knicks jackson was a vocal supporter of bradleys run for the presidency and often wore his campaign button in public jackson announced his acceptance of the position of head coach of the los angeles lakers while bradley was campaigning in california in  and he was a regular draw on the bradley money trail during the campaign bradley later called it a great honor to be the presenter when jackson was inducted into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame in  bradleys campaign initially had strong prospects due to highprofile endorsements and as his fundraising efforts gave him a deep war chest however it floundered in part because it was overshadowed by senator john mccains far more attentiongaining but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the republican nomination mccain had stolen bradleys thunder on several occasions bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat in the iowa caucus despite spending heavily there as the unions pledged their support for gore he then lost the new hampshire primary  bradley finished a distant second during each of the primaries on super tuesday on march   after failing to win any of the first  primaries and caucuses in the election process bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed gore he ruled out the idea of running as the vicepresidential candidate and did not answer questions about possible future runs for the presidency he said that he would continue to speak out regarding his brand of politics calling for campaign finance reform gun control and increased health care insurance after politicsedit later in

in part as an outstandingly distinguished athlete a weighty pillar of the senate and still a powerful advocate of the weak in  bradley was awarded the distinguished eagle scout award this award is
