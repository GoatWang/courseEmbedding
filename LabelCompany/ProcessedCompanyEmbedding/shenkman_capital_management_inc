represent an agreement in which a corporation commits to repay borrowed funds under set terms judging the potential to repay is where shenkman capital can make a difference high yield bonds offer lower volatility than equities due to their coupon income high yield bonds should be a strategic allocation in most cases the high yield market meets the actuarial assumption of a  return which is generated predominantly by an annual income stream high yield securities have historically produced significantly higher riskadjusted returns than most other fixed income sectors in down markets a larger coupon for high yield securities helps to offset market declines and in up markets high yield securities usually correlate to rising equities high yield securities have attributes that enable investors to benefit from corporate developments as well as enjoy the characteristics of fixed income high yield bonds are generally not impacted by modest rises in interest rates additionally spreads are more a reflection of market expectations for future default rates rather than expectations for higher interest rates investors should not be misled by the common myths associated with high yield five myths of the high yield market yield compensates for credit risk the reality – the high yield market is characterized by asymmetric risk whereby the potential for downside losses outweighs upside capital appreciation the market is deep and liquid the reality – the high yield market is an overthecounter market that is highly dependent on dealer capital the majority of high yield bonds do not trade on a daily basis which means there may be a significant difference between trade prices and broker quotes credit ratings reflect the actual risk the reality – independent fundamental analysis is paramount additionally the market generally anticipates upgrades and downgrades long before the actual rating changes high yield bonds correlate to us treasuries the reality – over the last  years there have been six periods during which the year treasury yield has risen more than  basis points high yield bonds and leveraged loans had positive returns during each of these periods spreads correlate to interest rates the reality – historically spreads have been a reflection of the expected default rates over a six to ninemonth period an expectation of low default rates typically results in spread compression about us firm profile letter from cio our culture the shenkman difference professionals investments research process lessons learned client focus product offerings us high yield

driving force in making capital available to support growth some are more creditworthy than others caution is our watchword high yield bank loans are loans made to noninvestment grade companies these loans are senior in the company’s capital structure and are typically secured by the company’s assets bank loans also have a floating rate coupon meaning the yield on the bank loans fluctuates with interest rates why bank loans seniority in the capital structure means that borrowers are contractually obligated to make payments on their loans before payments to other creditors which generally results in a higher recovery rate leveraged loans are typically secured by the company’s physical assets which helps to preserve principal value reduce volatility and can lead to higher recovery rates floating rate coupons act as a hedge against rising interest rates historically performing very well during inflationary environments high yield loans offer yield improvement relative to investment grade bonds with considerably shorter duration and generally similar volatility characteristics bank loans can be viewed as a logical substitute or supplement to a core fixed income allocation over the past decade bank loans have transitioned from being a bankdominated market to an institutionally accepted asset class with a market value of over  trillion at the end of  during this transition
