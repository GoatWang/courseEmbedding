sporting events featured on numerous networks including abc cbs nbc espn hbo showtime usa bet and telemundo major mma brand experience provides the company with valuable expertise to drive the company’s growth in a large market opportunity valuation we are valuing amma using a x ps multiple applied to our  sales estimate of  million generating a target price of  a x ps multiple values amma at a steep discount to ufc which was valued at x sales at the time of its acquisition in  we believe a discount is appropriate given that amma is at the earlier stage in the mma space than ufc the dominant brand globally some notes on our model we are projecting amma to generate revenue of  million in fy  million in fy and  million in fy we have projected amma to have a qoq growth between  we believe that the company’s organic marketing reach and sponsorship deals will significantly increase revenue growth in fy and fy and amma’s market penetration rate will begin to increase significantly between hh we assume that the company will raise equity in fy fy and fy to finance operations and acquisitions we believe that management may turn to alternative financing for additional capital to finance acquisitions our projections are based on optimistic assumptions that the company will expand to  regional mma promotions by the end of fy significant progress into international expansion by the end of fy and continued expansion globally in fy risks amma’s business represents a new business model in the mma industry the company has limited operating history and the company’s business strategy may not successfully address risks and uncertainties that the business might face and could adversely affect the overall success andor delay profitability there are substantial doubts about amma’s ability to continue to run its business operations due to the company’s business expansion and usage of capital the company lacks sufficient cash flows to finance operations and acquisitions the company may not be able to continue its business operations without raising capital failure to complete a capital raise would likely slow the company’s expected growth amma’s business expansion could be affected by other successful mma promotions the company is not a direct competitor to successful mma promotions like ufc that operate in the industry however these successful mma promotions could adversely impact amma’s business strategy and expansion with significant usage of their greater resources company may not be able to attract promotional and advertising sponsorships amma’s business strategy includes developing national sponsorship agreements with regional and national consumer brands to increase its audience and overall profitability if the company is unable to attract promotional and advertising sponsorships amma’s operating results will be adversely affected potential class action lawsuit a class action lawsuit against the company seeks damages on behalf of
