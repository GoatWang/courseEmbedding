forsign me up  thursday march   the ride or die makeup tag  my favorite beauty products disclaimer all of the opinions expressed in this post are my own  i was not compensated for this post in any way hello beautiful i havent done a beauty post in awhile so i thought id tackle the ride or die makeup tag once and for all the ride or die makeup tag is something ive been seeing around pinterest youtube and the rest of the web for awhile now this tag was started by jaclyn hill a youtuber and beauty blogger and you can check out her original post here in case you arent familiar with this tag heres how the challenge works for each category of makeup foundation concealer lipstick lip gloss etc you can only choose one ride or die product to save basically you just have to ask yourself if i was on a desert island and could only have one foundationconcealerlipsticketc with me which product from my beauty bag would i want to take hopefully im not just being overconfident but i think this challenge will be fairly easy for me while i love love love makeup and beauty products im not the kind of person who buys a ton of products instead i tend to have my favorites that i get attached to and keep rebuying over and over and over again so even though you wont get the benefit of watching me suffer and struggle over which products to select sorry guys  im actually hella boring im super excited to share some of those favorites with you now face  foundation loreal true match foundation in soft ivory loreals true match is unique from any other foundation ive tried simply because of the sheer number of shades that it offers dont get me wrong the texture is great it blends amazingly  but the thing that truly sets it apart from any other product ive tried is the incredible number of shades for cool warm and neutral skin tones alike until i found this product i felt like every foundation i used was too yellow for my skin tone  and then i found out that loreal makes this foundation for people with neutral undertones like me so if you have a hardtomatch skin tone check out loreals line of true match foundations you wont regret it i promise get it for  from ulta concealer benefit boiing concealer in  light this concealer is marketed as industrial strength which is exactly the reason why i bought it in the first place to be honest i wasnt sure when i read that label that the product would live up to what it promised  but it totally did thats why benefits boiing concealer makes my list of ride or dies no questions asked its creamy thick formula can cover everything from a huge red zit to the darkest of dark circles get it for  from sephora blushbronzer elf contouring blush  bronzing powder in st lucia as you can see my ride or die list is a mixed bag of drugstore and highend beauty products alike  and elfs st lucia blush and bronzer duo is definitely one of the drugstore rockstars this product is subtle shimmery and flattering on almost any skintone though ive never used it before so i cant compare the two ive even heard that this product is a perfect dupe for narss famous orgasm blush and at just  you seriously cannot beat that price get it for  from target foundation primer smashbox photo finish primer admittedly i rarely use a primer except on special occasions or really hot sweaty days when i worry my makeup might melt right off my face however on those occasions when i do smashboxs photo finish primer is the absolute best product for helping stubborn makeup stay put the best part it goes on clear and light without that greasy oily finish thats seemingly ubiquitous among so many foundation primers get it for  from nordstrom eyes eyeshadow primer too faced shadow insurance primer much like foundation primer i dont often use an eye primer unless its a special occasion or a hot summer day however on the days that i do use this product i definitely notice a difference in the pigmentation and longevity of my eye makeup too faced shadow insurance primer ensures see what i did there that your eyeshadow will stay put through thick and thin i swear on the days i use this product i could walk to hell and back come back with half the rest of my makeup melted off and still my eyeshadow wouldnt budge get it for  from too faced eyeshadow palette too faced natural eyes eye shadow collection i forgot to include this product in the graphic sadly unpopular opinion time i know everyone loves to rave about the naked palettes but im the proud owner of three of them  the naked  palette and naked basics  and   and although i love them ill never love them as much as i love my too faced natural eyes palette these shadows go on kind of sheer so if youre more into an ultrapigmented finish i can see why youd prefer the naked palettes however  i love the way they blend and last throughout my entire day  even without primer on the glitter stays firmly put on my eyelids as opposed to gravitating down my cheeks get it for  from sephora ps if you want to see exactly which shades i use check out this post about my weekly beauty routine  eyeliner kat von d tattoo liner since a sultry cat eye is my alltime favorite makeup look ive tried a fair number of liquid liners in my day after so many experiments in drugstore and highend liners alike i can say with confidence that this product is one of the best liquid liners ive ever used if you like a pen liner as opposed to a brush or a gel or something like that then youll love how rich and creamy this product is to apply it helps you achieve that precise line without being watery or prone to smudging and as someone whos better at drawing with pen and paper than she is with eyeliner i find it to be such a simple product to maneuver overall this liner gets a  out of  from me  and of course a coveted spot in my ride or die makeup kit get it for  from sephora  mascara bareminerals lash domination mascara ive used the same tube of this mascara for so long its probably unhygienic tbh  but i love it so much i just cant bear to throw it out honestly i can barely tell the difference between most formulas of mascara but theres just something about this one that sets it apart  its not too thin not too clumpy not too dark its juuuuust right for my lashes however the wand is what truly makes this product as luscious and volumizing as it is the wand separates every last lash preventing your mascara from clumping and lengthening with every stroke get it for  from ulta eyebrow pencil anastasia brow wiz pencil in taupe i fully realize that by including this in my ride or die post im solidifying myself as another basic beauty blogger  but if im being completely honest theres just no way around it anastasias brow products are simply the best ones out there of every brow pencil ive tried nothing has compared to the subtle pigmentation and precise lines that ive gotten with the anastasia brow wiz pencil not to be overlydramatic but this product was seriously what converted me from someone who never did her brows to someone who cant go out without them filled get it for  from sephora lips lipstick elf moisturizing lipstick in bordeaux beauty okay so in my last post about this product i was utterly convinced that its true name was bordeaux berry having realized the error of my ways im now going to do the product the justice it deserves this lipstick was one of my christmas presents from ryan and i was super excited to open it because ive been dying to try the vampy lipstick trend before this product red lipstick was my goto however id long admired the sexy glamorous look of a dark lordestyle lip and couldnt wait to see how it looked on me i was pleasantly surprised to find that this lipstick was the perfect blend of purply and reddish tones perfectly complementing my pale skin also its worth mentioning that this lipstick while creamy and hydrating doesnt seem to budge no matter what you do you can eat kiss drink and while a little lipstick might transfer onto your fork partner or glass the pigment on your lips will remain virtually unaltered for just  this product is both an investment and a steal get it for  from elf cosmetics  liquid lipstick stila stayallday liquid lipstick in beso its probably cheating to go from lipstick to liquid lipstick but since theyre technically two different things im rolling with it anyways i love love love this product  its the best red lip i have ever worn and dare i say will ever wear it was the first liquid lipstick i ever tried not to mention the first shade of red i ever dared put on i quickly fell in love with its longlasting formula which  much like the elf moisturizing lipstick  will not budge no matter what abuses you inflict on it also its my personal belief that this shade of red is ultraflattering on every skin tone its not too orangey and without bluish undertones so its more of what you might call a true red get it for  from ulta lip balm fresh sugar lip balm in rose i have been using this product for about five years ever since i first stepped foot into a sephora it was my firstever free birthday gift as a beauty insider and it was probably one of my firstever empties  and for good reason ive been using this product since i was thirteen not because im a creature of habit though that may be true but because theres nothing out there that compares to it the formula is creamy and hydrating and the sheer rose hue is the perfect my lips but better lip color in my opinion this lip balm and a little bit of mascara are all youll ever need for those days when you dont want a full face of makeup get it for  from sephora lip gloss naked ultra nourishing lip gloss in nooner apparently every lip gloss ive ever owned and loved has been renamed because the one that i have from the limitededition naked on the run palette is named sesso however nooner is pretty much the same gorgeous shade this shade is one of those perfect my lips but better colors  which ive been saying a lot lately i know but i much prefer a natural look to a glam one so it works  that comes with a little hint of shimmer its hydrating and longwearing without drying up in that gross way that lip glosses often do plus it has an almost minty aftertaste that leaves you feeling so fresh that youll want to keep reapplying it all throughout the day get it for  from nordstrom lip exfoliator elf lip exfoliator admittedly lip exfoliator is a bit of a weird category for this challenge however i just discovered this product recently and absolutely cannot get over how incredible it is this product smooths shines and hydrates your lips like no other its gritty but never abrasive simple to use and most importantly to me at least it has an ahmazing taste just like brown sugar get it for  from elf cosmetics scents body spray bath and body works beautiful day fine fragrance mist this product is the only scent im including in my ride or die post because im not a huge fan of traditional alcoholbased perfumes bath and body works fine fragrance mists on the other hand are light and nottooconcentrated  the perfect affordable scents for everyday wear though i have many favorites from bath and body works i chose the beautiful day spray because ive simply never gotten that type of reaction from any perfume ive worn before i actually first caught on to the magic of this scent from a friend at bu  fully expecting her to tell me it was some expensive designer perfume i asked her about the amazing scent she was wearing and she turned me on to beautiful day then when ryan fell headoverheels with this scent instore i knew i just had to have it currently im using a different fine fragrance mist from them however i have beautiful dayscented cream body wash right now and im absolutely in love this clean floral scent will leave you smelling fresh without leaving a cloud of perfume behind wherever you go i promise you and your special someone will both go crazy for the incredible smell get it for  from bath and body works     want more makeup and beauty from haley marie sign up for my newsletter  indicates required email address  first name  share this

usd cart  menu jasmine  ylang ylang  sgd medium   hours   sgd travel tin   hours   sgd add to cart brands tips  safety ask us a question click to learn more about the brands we love           why soy candles  soy candles are natural since they’re made from vegetable oil soybeans on the other hand paraffin candles are made from petroleum oil as a result soy wax candles do not increase the co level in the atmosphere like paraffin candles do furthermore soy candles do not require chemicals to scent them  soy candles burn  longer than regular candles therefore even though soy wax candles are sometimes more expensive than paraffin wax candles to buy they are still more costeffective in the long run furthermore soy candles burn evenly leaving almost no excess wax on the sides of the jar  soy candles burn cleaner than regular paraffin candles do as a result they don’t produce much black soot like paraffin candles do candle soot is more of a nuisance than you might realize if you burn a lot of candles over time it can discolour your walls  furniture and stain the edges of your carpet  soy candles are nontoxic since they are made of vegetable oil have a lower melting point so the wax itself doesn’t get as hot produce negligible amounts of soot and release no known carcinogens into the air compared to paraffin candles soy wax candles are much healthier for humans pets and the environment plus they clean up easier just use soap and water when the wax is spilled  the scent from soy candles is much stronger and more pleasant than the scent from paraffin wax candles because of the lower melting point of soy wax there is a larger amount of the liquid wax pool around the candle wick itself it is from this liquid wax pool and the wick itself that the essential oils evaporate into the atmosphere  candle care the first time you burn your candle allow it to burn for at least  hours until the whole top is liquid with wax this will help your candle burn more evenly next time always centre the wick trim to mm and remove any wick debris before burning place the candle on its wooden lid on a flat surface away from flammable materials and draughts while burning and after burning replace the timber lid  diffuser care place the sticks that came with your reed diffuser into the bottle to absorb the essential oils flip sticks so that the dry side of the sticks is now closest to the bottle and the saturated end is in the air place unsaturated dry end of the sticks into the bottle let your reed diffuser naturally permeate your space reed diffusers will continue to evaporate into the air creating a subtle and luxurious scentto refresh the fragrance of the reed diffuser simply repeat steps above click to learn more about the brands we love           name email
