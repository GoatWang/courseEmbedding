finkelstein’s home in atlanta so it’s usual to begin these kinds of oral history interviews by looking at early family life and general family background and what your parents did and this kind of thing i read your cv online i know that you were born july   in new york city so into what kind of family was that finkelstein both my parents came from the same small town in poland not far from warsaw it’s called sokolow that’s polish for small town rickles when did they come over to america finkelstein around  or  rickles did they bring any skills with them were they educated or have trades finkelstein my father was ordained as a rabbi before he left poland but he didn’t — he was offered a seat in new york when he arrived but he decided it wasn’t for him and went into the grocery business rickles whereabouts did they live in new york finkelstein my babyhood was in brooklyn rickles right so did they have any kind of scientific interests or mathematical interests at all or have any interest in learning about science finkelstein my father no my mother read a little in behaviorism and studied languages but not science no rickles do you have any brothers or sisters finkelstein no rickles so you’re an only child so you lived in brooklyn so your first school was in brooklyn finkelstein public schools rickles which school was that finkelstein the earliest one i remember was near flatbush avenue i don’t even remember the number of it any longer rickles were there any people at that school who went later on to — was it stuyvesant finkelstein pardon rickles were there any people from that early school or from where you lived who continued on with you to later life that you were close to finkelstein no my parents moved rather often as they advanced from one store to another and that always involved a completely new set of friends rickles ah okay did you display anything so what age are we talking in primary school finkelstein i migrated to new york city manhattan at about the age of  rickles okay and then you went into stuyvesant finkelstein first i went to joan of arc junior high school and then to stuyvesant rickles all right so before you went to stuyvesant had you displayed any mathematical physicsbased kind of skills did you show — finkelstein i was kind of the head of my class in mathematics and behind in language rickles do you remember any particular books that got you interested and excited finkelstein i was asking my algebra teacher questions about calculus while i was at joan of arc i suppose i must have gotten my hands on silvanus p thompson calculus made easy because that’s where i learned calculus from rickles yeah that’s the famous feynman one isn’t it “what one fool can do any fool can do” finkelstein ancient simian proverb rickles yeah laughter excellent so you mentioned that particular teacher he must have — finkelstein mrs reinhart rickles right so must have taken an interest was there a bit of an influence there finkelstein well she was just a lively woman i don’t think she paid any particular attention to me rickles then on to stuyvesant high school was that competitive back then it’s kind of competitive to get in there so you have to — finkelstein there was an entrance exam and they skimmed i’m very grateful to the new york public school system rickles what date are you talking for your entrance there do you remember do you know finkelstein  rickles to enter stuyvesant is that right finkelstein i spent three years there ‘ through ‘ wait no no i’m sorry that was city college ‘ through ‘ so stuyvesant must have been like ‘ to ‘ rickles so right obviously slap bang in the war years finkelstein that’s right rickles so do you remember that happening do you remember what happened to the teaching staff did anything switch around finkelstein i distinctly remember the sunday when the headlines said war the japanese had attacked pearl harbor that was when i was still living in brooklyn rickles yeah that was december  did you have as a teacher melba phillips by any chance she was there right was she there finkelstein i didn’t know that where stuyvesant or — rickles maybe it was city college of new york i’m not sure which one i think it was stachel who… i’ll need to check that i know she was at one of those so i read somewhere that you were friends with jacob schwartz quite early on finkelstein right quite close friends i think of him as my best friend we went through high school and city college together rickles okay so what kind of interactions did you have were you challenging each other with math problems were you reading books together or teaching each other finkelstein we talked in high school and in city college we often took — not often — once or twice we took honors courses together we would have study sessions jack had the theory that you could get by with the least sleep if you broke your sleep up after a couple of hours so he would sleep two hours read as long as he could sleep two hours rickles i tried that finkelstein i went through weil’s algebraic geometry that way rickles while still at high school finkelstein no that was in college rickles right this is in college but you were friends with him in high school as well right so do you remember what kinds of things you were discussing in high school what kind of topics or what was getting you excited finkelstein i dredged up the memories for the in memoriam that i contributed to his volume i distinctly remember riding home with him in the subway and asking him the difference between mathematics and physics at that stage from all i knew they were both fiddling with equations rickles so what kind of age would that have been by the way roughly still high school finkelstein that would have been probably… since he entered stuyvesant i believe a year after me he was younger than i was that would probably be my second year at stuyvesant rickles did you discuss things like logic and computing i know computing was at a very — finkelstein not in high school but very much in college he was really influenced by his studies under emil leon post rickles yeah so post was at city college as well right yes john stachel was — finkelstein as was martin davis rickles oh was he not a student there he was teaching finkelstein martin davis and jack were both students at the same time as me at city rickles so going back to high school do you remember what topics were coming up in the courses what subjects you were studying finkelstein the person i interacted most with somehow was the chemistry professor liebermann i would not be a bit surprised it’s the same liebermann that feynman mentions but his was out in long island and mine was on manhattan island but people move they were both chemistry professors… chemistry teachers i mean rickles but it was a man finkelstein oh yes definitely rickles it wasn’t hugh liebermann was it finkelstein pardon rickles hugh finkelstein there was a hughes at city college who was pretty important he was my mentor in an honors course and i believe he wrote a book with zemansky i think he was quite smart he taught a course in mathematical physics at city rickles so when you were at high school did you know that you were going to go to college and do physics or were you… so what was the… finkelstein i was already reading… one of my folk heroes i guess is gabriel kron do you know the name at all rickles he’s the computer guy right finkelstein no no he was an electrical engineer with mathematical and generalist inclinations rickles that was the guy who traveled around the world after… finkelstein no his specialty was applying tensor analysis to electrical networks and rotating electrical machinery he wrote a few books on the subject which actually involved differential geometry or equations at least more general than those of general relativity his colleagues laughed at him for calling it tensor analysis because they were all used to matrix algebra for the purpose of networks so he appealed to banesh hoffmann to verify that he was really doing tensor analysis using transformation theory and he was rickles it’s not a bit like roger penrose did later is it penrose had some kind of notation finkelstein oh it’s a very different order of magnitude kron had great aspirations but his mathematics were very limited rickles it’s kron as in kr — finkelstein kron right rickles yeah i know the name finkelstein and penrose is a really gifted mathematician rickles so when did you stumble across kron finkelstein in my last year at city i think yeah actually it was indirect there was a branch of barnes  noble near stuyvesant high school and wandering through it i saw a couple of books by doherty and keller the mathematics of modern engineering in it they described kron’s method rickles yeah because i thought kron didn’t have a university position i thought he was kind of independent finkelstein oh no he doesn’t no he didn’t he was an engineer at general electric in schenectady rickles ah yeah that’s the same guy i know the name did you stumble across these books by the liebers finkelstein oh they were delightful yes i enjoyed them very much the mathematics was just at the level i could enjoy i’m sorry they’re out of print they’re really — rickles some of them are back in print actually finkelstein oh that’s good news rickles yeah the relativity one and infinity finkelstein excellent rickles when did you stumble across those do you remember finkelstein in high school rickles in high school yeah stanley deser mentioned those as well as being sort of influential finkelstein right books were scarcer back then rickles yeah you know she went to robertson to proofread that book so it has good pedigree finkelstein i didn’t know that rickles i found some files i went through the robertson archives i don’t suppose you were aware of her institute lillian lieber had an institute called the galois institute finkelstein i saw that mentioned in her book it rang no bells at all i never came across it again rickles yeah it’s very hard to find information on actually which is strange finkelstein lovely title then as i approached graduation i went to the head of the physics department there a man named alexander efron and told him i liked physics and mathematics what should i do for a living i gather that he graduated in physics in the middle of the depression and was never able to find a physics job and ended up teaching high school and he urged me not to go into physics he said if i like physics and mathematics i should be an electrical engineer so i enrolled at city in electrical engineering and really it was there that i discovered there was such a thing as a profession of physicist again my first year i took my courage and switched rickles what did your parents think of the career choice finkelstein they were very permissive they thought i was going to be a doctor that’s why i took latin in high school rickles how were you funded as an undergraduate finkelstein i lived at home and my parents supported me city college was a subway college i lived in harlem rickles so you mentioned martin davis and schwartz were there again and they were drifting into — were they studying mathematics both mathematics i’m wondering if you got any of the influence of the logic and these kinds of things finkelstein intense really they would lecture me on gödel’s theorem until they began to understand what was going on and post had them programming computers before they existed rickles ah interesting finkelstein to carry out his program in decidability and computable functions rickles what computers were they finkelstein all paper conceptual you don’t have to have a computer to program one rickles excellent finkelstein they were doing recursive function theory rickles as undergraduates finkelstein for example they would program a turing machine which is completely conceptual i know that influenced me rickles so when did you switch to physics physics or maths finkelstein i switched from engineering to physics in that first year at city rickles to physics you didn’t get tempted by maths finkelstein tempted but not significantly tempted i was too much in love with physics rickles so what kind of discussions were you having at this time i mean so john stachel was there were you friends with john stachel finkelstein yes inasmuch as i was friends with anyone stachel was certainly in my group rickles do you remember anything about the… because obviously the communist paranoia started then his dad must have been indicted roundabout the time he started i suppose finkelstein right and i didn’t get involved in it but i knew it was going on rickles i don’t suppose you have notebooks and stuff from your undergraduate days finkelstein from city college no from graduate school maybe rickles stachel mentions that the head of physics at city college wasn’t very nice he didn’t like him do you remember anything along those lines finkelstein let me remember rickles he didn’t give me a name because he ended up leaving right finkelstein first of all i made a mistake in names when i spoke of hugh — when you mentioned hugh and i switched to hughes the best theoretical physicist at city college at the time was professor wolfe i don’t know why i called him hughes rickles so who else was teaching in physics at that time in city college finkelstein well the ones i remember are wolfe and zemansky and it will take me awhile to dredge up other names i took an electronics laboratory but i forget the name a lovely man but i forget his name they even had a course in ac machinery electrical lab i probably took that rickles so you started just as the war finished i mean did you notice the effects of that again do you remember anything about the effects on the courses on what kind of physics was done on the teachers finkelstein i’m sure they were… i’m not sure they were strong actually they may have been no i didn’t notice what was going on rickles do you have any recollection about what kind of physics you wanted to do whilst you were an undergraduate finkelstein that was really determined for me in my first year at city i knew that one had to know quantum theory to do physics and i found there weren’t that many books on quantum theory then i found them incredibly opaque rickles do you remember which ones you were reading finkelstein well i looked at eyring walter kimball and i looked at pauling and i found them impossible to read the break from mechanics and electrodynamics was just too much to follow mathematics was not the problem the problem was the disconnection from the mechanical way of doing physics i really was in despair i went into a fairly great depression it was just an incredible stroke of luck — and also i spent some time searching — but i came across a paper by birkhoff and von neumann “the logic of quantum mechanics” actually all the basic ideas in that paper are already in von neumann’s book on quantum mechanics but i didn’t know that at the time i thought this was the beginning von neumann made it very clear and convincing that quantum theory was a change in logic corresponding to that of the change in geometry and general relativity within a day or two i realized that if one changes logic then one must reconstruct the whole set theory which was founded on that logic i really had some electricity in my spine at being in on the bottom of that ladder rickles so do you think your interactions with davis and schwartz sort of helped prepare you for taking that on board finkelstein i’m certain of it really rickles did you discuss the von neumann paper with those or with anybody else finkelstein i probably tried to of course it was what i was thinking of all the time but i never found anyone who was responsive rickles yeah i’m trying to remember what the aftermath of that paper was i don’t think it got heavily cited really did it finkelstein i think it is now rickles it is now yeah because of the idea that logic is an empirical thing but yeah at the time finkelstein actually there’s nothing really new conceptually beyond what heisenberg said what von neumann was doing was axiomatizing heisenberg’s statements heisenberg already understood that filtrations don’t commute in quantum theory and they do in classical physics it’s just that von neumann had rather recently finished his thesis in which he invented a new functional set theory so he was alert to axiomatizations rickles were you not tempted to go and try and study with either of these von neumann or birkhoff finkelstein i’ll say that never occurred to me rickles did you ever meet von neumann later on finkelstein i chauffeured him when i was a graduate student at mit he came to town to give an address to the american mathematical society of harvard and i was the graduate student they entrusted with getting him from tech square to kendall square i didn’t have the courage to say a word rickles laughter that’s very good finkelstein but by the way his talk was one… he was asked to update hilbert’s problems as any problems of mathematics today and he really only gave one exploring quantum mathematics the content was his quantum logic rickles i take it you went and saw the lecture finkelstein i was at that lecture yes rickles did you ask a question finkelstein no rickles okay so yeah so why did you — finkelstein and looking back from my present understanding i was incredibly naïve in those days and i realize that von neumann was too in that he dropped the operational foundations that heisenberg had and really concentrated on axiomatizing one aspect of heisenberg’s work so it’s influenced more by his own background and i would say a belief in matter waves than by the philosophy of heisenberg and bohr but he was quite clear that the old logic was gone and the new one worked rickles you mean the focus on observables finkelstein he didn’t talk about observables i don’t think there’s a description of an experiment rickles no that’s true actually finkelstein it gave an opportunity to use hilbert space there’s this famous paper by wigner on “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics” and then there’s this response by jack schwartz “the pernicious influence of mathematics in the natural sciences” this book by von neumann is an example of both rickles yeah i know those papers well so did you study — who was teaching quantum mechanics at city college finkelstein i took an honors course with wolfe well actually i took one with wolfe and one with zemansky rickles how do you spell zemansky finkelstein zemansky with zemansky i read this very very fat book on quantum statistical mechanics i’m blocking the name because i haven’t looked at it in  years or longer tolman tolman’s book rickles oh yeah i assume you didn’t do any general relativity was there any general relativity being taught at all finkelstein no but i read einstein’s book in my early years at stuyvesant at stevens thanks to the generosity of peter bergmann i went to a conference in france at l’abbaye de royaumont not far from paris that was my first conference in general relativity rickles when was that that must have been ‘ ‘ though right finkelstein right quarterly and i’m trying to remember what i was doing there rickles did you give a talk did you give a paper finkelstein i think so yes it was ‘ no i don’t think i had done the work i did on the black hole by the time of that meeting rickles there must have been an earlier meeting i think because i think you gave — finkelstein i’m not sure what i talked about anyway how did we get on to that oh yes this was my first introduction to a group of relativists i went around asking people my age why they took up relativity and without exception all of them gave the same reason i did eddington’s book the mathematical principle of general relativity rickles i was going to mention eddington there are a few — when do you read eddington’s book finkelstein when i was at city college rickles did you have a go at any of other eddington’s — finkelstein oh i read it from cover to cover yeah rickles did you read any of his other books finkelstein i went to his other books also i tried to read fundamental theory rickles yeah deser says the same thing he tried to read fundamental theory laughs did you try again later on in life to read that book finkelstein well today i have a little more… it’s not just that i don’t understand it i see him making important mistakes but they’re deep mistakes it’s not mathematical errors rickles did you learn from eddington’s book with anybody or was this just on your own finkelstein yes rickles when at city college or mit or later finkelstein oh it certainly wasn’t mit it must have been city yes rickles okay did you choose any mathematics courses to help you learn this kind of material finkelstein the mathematics course…first of all feshbach gave a course in mathematical physics using a mimeograph version of what later became his book morse and feshbach rickles that was at mit though right not at city college finkelstein yes at city college i can’t remember taking any important math courses that weren’t required rickles rarita wasn’t at city college was he finkelstein didn’t meet him rickles was he there though finkelstein he was ahead of me i believe yeah at mit i took a couple of math courses that were important for me one was under walter harry pitts rickles yeah i was going to mention him finkelstein he taught a course out of stone functional analysis it was basically a course in hilbert’s space algebra rickles that’s not pitts as in mcculloch and pitts finkelstein it is exactly rickles it’s that one finkelstein we were very good friends to the extent that either of us were able to have friends at mit we went for walks along the beach i remember him picking up clams from the sand and eating them this struck me as odd at the time but of course the same clams you get in the fish market so why not he introduced me to mcculloch rickles so they’d done their… because i didn’t think he — finkelstein i spoke with him of my interest in general relativity and he said “but that’s merely special relativity made local” rickles what was pitts’s background because i always think of him as the mcculloch and pitts person and the nervous system stuff but he was a mathematician or a mathematical physicist finkelstein he was a protégé of wiener and he was i think a real genius selftaught his father worked in a boiler factory making boilers and i think pitts did too for a while it’s a tragic story he learned enough chemistry to make his own drugs and destroyed his brain quite a few years later when i was at stevens i made a pilgrimage i realized how important my acquaintance with him had been and i made a pilgrimage to cambridge to say thank you i found him finally and he was sitting reading in the bar in harvard square he didn’t remember me and he wasn’t really able to carry on a conversation and wasn’t interested in carrying on a conversation so the pitts i knew was gone i don’t know how much longer he lived after that rickles i read a book about norbert wiener a biography norbert wiener apparently there was some issue between him and mcculloch i think which led onto pitts getting depressed maybe i’m remembering it wrong did you remember anything about that interaction where you there when wiener and mcculloch and pitts were all there at mit finkelstein yes certainly absolutely yeah i wasn’t involved in their direction rickles so going back to city college did you do a bachelor’s thesis while you were there what was that on finkelstein right our teacher was a delightful man jack and i took an honors course together over the summer and we had to produce a thesis his name will come to me in a moment he was a little odd in that he had an infinite number of children he furnished his room with stacks of cots rickles yeah that would make you a bit odd finkelstein they ran him ragged there was nothing like parental discipline his name is on the tip of my tongue i haven’t uttered it in decades rickles do you remember what he taught finkelstein jack’s honors thesis was on vector spaces with a transfinite number of dimensions beyond hilbert’s space which has a countable number of dimensions we had read andre weil’s book together during that summer in our intensive way and i wrote a thesis on alternatives to weil’s concept of algebraic geometry rickles weil… when you say weil… finkelstein andre weil rickles oh as in weil yes finkelstein right it was in that study that i learned the importance of algebra as being regular rickles so you’d learned some algebraic geometry tools while still an undergraduate finkelstein i guess so yes right that turned out to be very useful in reading quantum logic because of the use of algebra in setting up coordinates for quantum logics rickles did any of that go into your thesis or was it separate finkelstein there was no mention of quantum logic in my thesis it was pure algebraic geometry rickles but did you have it in mind no finkelstein i didn’t realize how useful it would be rickles okay so when did you decide on mit did you apply various places or was mit the only place finkelstein i probably applied to a few places i know i applied to princeton but they had a quota rickles did you have anybody in mind at princeton or just… finkelstein not really i knew what i wanted to do i guess you would call it quantum gravity but they needed someone to do computation in the astronomy department and they hired one of my best friends also going back to stuyvesant high school and then city irvin rabinowitz that filled their quota for new york jews for that year so i went to mit and i’m very grateful i did at mit i was allowed into weisskopf’s evenings with his graduate students an experience that i’ll always cherish marvelous man he had an attitude to quantum theory related to that at princeton like the difference between heisenberg and wigner so i learned it almost from the horse’s mouth and i’m very grateful at princeton they were worried about things like collapsing wave functions and multiple universes but they were certainly going around saying that nobody understands quantum theory and the fact is heisenberg understood quantum theory and bohr came very close the big problem was getting out from under the idea of matter waves the ancestry of de broglie and schrödinger who never understood quantum theory he wrote papers to prove it like his famous schrödinger cat paradox nowadays computers have schrödinger states and they are as close to absolute zero as they can get them so for a cat to have a wave function you have to have a beam of cryogenic cats socalled that you can do interference experiments with it then the question of whether the cat is alive is kind of silly rickles yeah i think anton zeilinger once said he wants to put himself through a quantum interference device one day finkelstein right rickles did you begin with a master’s degree at mit or was it straight into — finkelstein at mit the master’s was given en passant if you decide to stay in for doctorate they gave you a master’s anyway rickles yeah weisskopf was your supervisor finkelstein no rickles or was it feshbach finkelstein or he was my supervisor until villars came i got there a year before felix villars rickles how do you spell that finkelstein villars rickles oh yes as in pauli and villars finkelstein he came from working with pauli so there was a little family incest there pauli weisskopf villars rickles feshbach was there as well though right was he there feshbach finkelstein did you say brother rickles no he was there at the same time and he was doing similar— finkelstein yes absolutely in fact i did a problem under him i never took a course in quantum theory and i got there when no course was being offered because i came in the middle of the term i had graduated a little early from high school… from city college so weisskopf just gave me the book on quantum theory of… it was the standard book at the time on… schiff and told me to do every problem so i handed in the problems and that was my education in quantum theory i’ve never taken a course in quantum theory rickles is it leonard schiff finkelstein leonard schiff it is rickles that was the standard mit textbook was it that everybody did finkelstein i guess right and it’s one of the best i still think rickles did you do any quantum field theory or was that from the schiff book does schiff go into quantum field theory i forget finkelstein a little bit at the end yes rickles so was your thesis topic set by your supervisor finkelstein yes rickles were you also working on separate projects as well at the same time or was it just — finkelstein well i tried to educate myself i must say that the period when i was doing my thesis is one of the more unpleasant times in my life i didn’t want to work on nuclear forces but the nonlinear theory of nuclear forces was as close as they came to the nonlinear theory of gravity quantum in both cases so that was the best they could do for me but i slept  hours a day or something like that rickles so when you were given this project was there some conscious decision to have it connected to general relativity finkelstein oh yes that was as close as they could come rickles so why at this stage did you want to do general relativity where did that come from finkelstein well that’s part of the original epiphany namely if changes in geometry show themselves up as fundamental forces then chances are changes in logic might take place from place to place and so as the other forces so i had the idea of paralleling einstein’s work in a quantum logical syntax that actually is consistent with the gauge program i didn’t quite understand that at the time but i felt that what i was doing was building on general relativity with trying to move the structure from its classical foundations to quantum ones without destroying it rickles so you were trying to solve the problem of quantum gravity really finkelstein well i wasn’t going to put it that way rickles was it you — finkelstein i wasn’t interested in quantizing gravity i was interested in quantizing the universe gravity was just one part of it rickles oh so you’re trying to get just some kind of unified theory based on logics finkelstein i think i was looking for a unified theory to me that is no longer a right thing to do it’s a trap but i was pretty deep in the trap rickles so you didn’t have any gödel kind of problems with unified theories of everything at the time unintelligible finkelstein i think it’s an archaic notion i trace it back to the logos of parmenides but i was buried i was floating in it rickles so who were you talking to about that side of your work while you were at mit because i mean there were plenty of people who were sort of interested in similar things so norbert wiener — i’ve just been at mit and i was looking at the wiener archives finkelstein wiener was a problem what was his attitude he had his own quantum theory he deeply resented heisenberg’s success in solving a problem that wiener couldn’t handle what was it again anyway he would bother weisskopf with his ideas for hours and finally in desperation they decided to throw him a graduate student they offered me the position but going back to classical physics which is what wiener was trying to do was the last thing i wanted to do they offered it then to another graduate student who collaborated with wiener rickles was that the differential space guy in quantum overlapping voices i forget the guy’s name finkelstein it could be yes in a moment i’ll probably get the name of the student but it never came close to quantum theory it was working on… differential space sounds right rickles i forget the student i know which one you mean i can find out finkelstein they published joint paper after joint paper on this idea and never got anywhere rickles yeah i can found that out but i actually found a paper from  in the norbert wiener archives where he was trying to come up with a unified theory of physics based on eddingtontype ideas on the centrality of the observer do you not remember finkelstein but eddington at least had noncommutative variables in his work i mean he got the essence of quantum theory and wiener never was willing to take that path rickles i’m trying to think who else was there who would have been relevant so who else were you speaking to if not wiener finkelstein my officemate was kerson huang we became pretty good friends i’m sorry that life has separated us rickles was gabor at mit finkelstein gabor i never met him as far as i know rickles because he was working on this… finkelstein holography rickles right and the logon stuff there are vague similarities to trying to get some kind of quantum of information idea you don’t remember any talks were there seminars — general regular physics seminars finkelstein right there were a couple there was a little seminar where graduate students were given the opportunity to exercise their ability before faculty i gave a talk there on the nonlinear meson on the tomonaga theory of bosonic excitations in a fermionic gas i realize now that my recent work is actually relevant to the problem how do you make bosons out of fermions you could think of tomonaga’s work as a limiting case rickles so your thesis was on the nonlinear meson theory finkelstein yeah essentially a theory purported by teller first i think rickles so it’s not yukawa’s theory that you were looking at or anything finkelstein it presupposes yukawa’s theory but yukawa proposed a linear meson theory the linearity was the interaction between the meson and the nucleon and the free meson was linear teller added what amounts to a repulsive force of meson to meson to account for the saturation of nuclear forces rickles so had the cosmic ray stuff happened by then finkelstein oh yes rickles so is this why it was being pursued so strongly finkelstein i didn’t know about the connection rickles okay so you were at mit until  finkelstein right rickles so obviously we get the korean war during that again was there any impact of the korean war on you during that time finkelstein no by then i was married and my wife was pregnant i was at stevens and we both decided that i shouldn’t leave her so i took advantage of draft deferment that was available rickles did you do any war work were you sort of expected to work on — finkelstein yes so for a while i actually transferred from stevens to nyu and worked at the aec computing facility i was studying radiation effects in the upper atmosphere rickles i have that you did some work and i think the photo i’ve got is from when you were working on — finkelstein that’s lab work at yeshiva university that comes a bit later in the story what happened is as a result of my work at what later became the courant institute at the aec computing facility yes i was even hired to work for project sherwood that’s the name associated with the los alamos group but i guess somehow the nyu group fitted under that rubric well at princeton… rickles matterhorn finkelstein …it went under another name rickles do mean the other project finkelstein i’m trying to remember the name of the princeton plasma lab rickles yeah it was matterhorn finkelstein matterhorn yes rickles lyman spitzer finkelstein exactly spitzer matterhorn jim tuck of sherwood forest rickles i’ll maybe come back to that but you — finkelstein i probably said schpitzer mispronounced i meant to say spitzer he’s an american rickles yeah because i have that you were doing some computing work in  at mit on project whirlwind is that right finkelstein yeah that was my thesis actually it was two steps first i had a nonlinear meson theory i had to solve the radial equation so i needed a computer to put it on first i put it on vannevar bush’s differential analyzer and it kept going off scale before i got to the origin or anywhere near it i thought this might be a computational fault so i switched to whirlwind and ran the computer there ran the program there and again never got close i could not approach the origin i expected to find some function like that you call a potential or the coulomb potential all in one defined on the whole real axis but i couldn’t get below a certain point finally a good high school friend donnie newman sort of took me aside and told me the facts of life about nonlinear differential equations and wandering singularities so the radial equation for the schiff nonlinear meson which has a φ term after the φ term with a  sign the real equation that blows up before you get to the origin at a point which depends on the amplitude of infinity that was my first encounter with the wandering singularity and i met it again in plasma physics and i met it again in the black hole every time it came as a surprise rickles how were you able to get on project… on the computer was it just available did you have to sign a thing saying “i would like to use the computer for this long” finkelstein i think there was no difficulty i simply walked in and asked “could i run this” rickles how did you know how to write the programs for it in those days who taught you that finkelstein oh i don’t remember they probably just gave me the manual i’d already been programming on turing machines and so on thanks to post rickles imaginary turing machines finkelstein right oh also while i was in high school i tried to build a logic digital computer in a garage we had no — it was me and virgil johannes who later became the head of an electrical engineering department at a school in new jersey it involved rectifiers i tried making them out of copper oxide — out of copper dipped in acid — and i couldn’t get good enough coatings it never got off the ground but anyway it relieved a childhood itch to actually be near a computer that worked rickles that’s very good phone rings finkelstein it will go away they always stop rickles laughs do you think getting your hands on computing equipment had any sort of influence on the type of logical work that you did and the nature of — you know bryce dewitt works on the computers he was on project sherwood wasn’t he he had the lagrangian hydrodynamics stuff detonation hydrodynamics finkelstien right rickles you can sort of trace lines from that work into his quantum gravity work do you think there’s anything traceable from the computing side in your case finkelstein i don’t know i’m not conscious of a strong connection but i’ve always felt at home with computers because it was early study with friends who worked under post rickles so it looks like you wrote a software package with somebody called gill and rotenberg called sadsac do you remember that how did that come about finkelstein it just happened that after i finished my thesis work there was a crash program to produce a package that could be used by executives of industry and finance who wanted to explore the use of computers in industry and business whirlwind had a totally unfriendly language and fortran didn’t exist yet so we put together a singleaddress simulated automatic computer that was much friendlier than the assembly language machine language it had instructions that any business user could use and gave an automatic post mortem whenever there was a crash rickles so it debugged itself basically was that the first one to do that was it the first example of that finkelstein i would not be surprised i’ve never checked stanley gill was over from england he had worked with wilkes rickles oh yeah maurice wilkes so who came up with the name sadsac finkelstein i probably did i like names the thing is that while whirlwind ran like the wind we so slowed it down with our post mortem facilities rickles the early version of windows finkelstein it was run interpretively so you could actually hear the computer doing instructions one at a time — thump thump thump rickles did you meet jay forrester or anything so he wasn’t in charge or anything finkelstein but i saw a room full of forrester tubes not long before they disappeared and were replaced by one little box of… rickles yeah those little magnetic loops finkelstein …of loops right that was impressive rickles i mean did you try and search anything out about people working on applying computers to physics because konrad zuse when was he doing his… oh no that was much later i suppose konrad zuse okay so ‘ then you went to stevens in ‘ or did you go to stevens earlier and then there was some back and forth finkelstein the only back and forth was with nyu rickles right so remind me what the nyu — finkelstein i had moved from stevens to nyu and then i moved back rickles in ‘ or later finkelstein i probably spent about a year at nyu in that time i visited the livermore radiation lab and worked there with windy winston harry bostick rickles okay so bostick was head of stevens wasn’t he later finkelstein not was first i met him at livermore and then when i returned to stevens i suggested him as head of the department and he accepted rickles okay was bryce dewitt at livermore at the time finkelstein i have no idea i didn’t realize he was associated with livermore i don’t think i met him there i would remember that rickles yeah well maybe he’d left by then so who else was at livermore how long did you go to overlapping voices finkelstein it was a summer rickles was it just bostick who you hung around with or were there— finkelstein i interacted with bostick more than anyone rickles did you start to discuss general relativity things with bostick because he had an interest right finkelstein he was an interesting man but he was not a mathematician at all even his plasma physics was pretty much intuitive he visualized magnetic lines of force he did end up with a unified theory he thought that everything was a magneto plasma rickles yeah because he applied… there’s a paper of his in the gravity research foundation essay competition thing from  where he had a theory of the stabilization of elementary particles by gravitational forces which i assume sounds plasmaish yeah so that’s where that comes from so who did you suggest bostick as head to finkelstein i guess to the administration rickles who was head before that did it have a head or was it running with a — finkelstein what happened to the previous head i don’t remember rickles so how did you get hired at stevens finkelstein how did i get hired through a friend george yevick had gotten his degree at mit and gone to stevens i always knew him quite well and recommended me to yevick we became good friends he’s deceased now rickles did you receive any other invitations from other places for jobs or anything finkelstein no no i guess perhaps because my work wasn’t that great or i’m isolated or something but i had to pretty much make my own way the thing is i hadn’t worked on the real problem of any member of the faculty and so they couldn’t recommend me to their colleagues there wasn’t a quantum gravity community rickles so what was your — finkelstein but i consider myself very fortunate to get a teaching job which allowed me enough time to think rickles well and it was lucky that it was at stevens obviously because it became the relativity hub finkelstein well that came after my going there of course i invited schiller and… rickles anderson finkelstein i don’t think i had anything to do with anderson’s coming i don’t remember his connection but maybe he came because of schiller schiller was already doing relativity because of bergmann he had his credentials and anderson i don’t know who he worked for but he was already a relativist rickles well yeah he was at syracuse as well finkelstein was he rickles yes so he was under bergmann as well finkelstein excellent so that became a little offshoot of bergmann’s of syracuse and then they are responsible for the meetings i was just fortunate enough to be around rickles let’s see so what was your initial research program do you remember when you started at stevens what was the thing you were interested in at the time finkelstein i felt i had to do an apprenticeship before i tackled the real problem i certainly went in through classical field theory but einstein talked as if a theory like general relativity like gravity might have all the elementary particles in it if you look carefully to the quantum mechanic this raises immediately the question of spin how do you get spin out of gravitons which have spin but here my reading of wigner was crucial wigner gave a topological theory of which systems could have spin not really he explained the spin of the electron as a result of the double connectedness of the rotation group because of that i took a course under hurewicz at mit on topology and learned about the higher homotopy groups from the man who invented them rickles who finkelstein witold hurewicz rickles oh yeah hurewitz i always pronounced it finkelstein right hurewicz he was a very dear man i realize that in order for the gravitation field to have spin you have to figure out how the rotation group acts on it and then see if the orbits of the rotation group can be shrunk to a point or not there are only two kinds those that you can and those that you can’t if they can then it doesn’t have spin and if they can’t then in principle it could have spin even though that might get lost in the perturbation theory calculation fundamentally the theory is nonlinear so the topology could be nontrivial you have to do the calculation of the homotopy group i think this was probably the first application of higher homotopy to physics nowadays they speak of moduli spaces rickles when are we talking here is this when you first started at stevens or earlier when you were doing… so ‘ finkelstein i started at stevens in ‘ rickles and you were immediately working on that idea getting spin½ finkelstein right and fortunately i met misner at these relativity meetings he was at princeton which was a hotbed of homotopy theory and he had studied it there he used homology theory intensively in his work on electromagnetism in gravitational fields in the formulation of the theory and in general relativity too but he knew homotopy theory as if he had worked in it so i went to him with my problem this was one of the thrilling moments of my life he just turned around and pulled steenrod’s theory of fiber bundles off the shelf and in a few moments converted my question about the homotopy of the gravitational field to a question about the homotopy of manifolds of subspaces nowadays there’s a name no there already was a name in steenrod i’m blocking on it anyway the problem was reduced from finding the first homotopy group the fundamental group of the field to finding the fourth homotopy group of finite dimensional manifold mainly of light cones in minkowski spacetime this is based on the fact that the topological purposes the gravitational field was just a field of light cones the answer came out two you had to go around twice there were two elements to the homotopy group it was nontrivial that meant that the gravitational field could have spin even if einstein thought so for a moment i was tempted to start studying the gravitational field but of course that assumes classical spacetime and i knew that one had to get to quantum spacetime to carry out the program so i resisted the temptation but that led to the black hole rickles oh we’ll come to that in a second how did you know about misner finkelstein we met at the stevens meetings rickles so when did they start the stevens meetings finkelstein shortly after i arrived rickles really they’ve been going that long was this the general seminars finkelstein yes no no rickles because then there were — finkelstein no not general it wasn’t a stevens seminar it was organized by anderson and schiller rickles oh so they go way back finkelstein i’d probably been there a couple of years at the time rickles i have the first one starting in  but you think they were way before that i mean there was — finkelstein it’s possible from this distance time telescopes there weren’t — it’s true i didn’t go to that many you’re probably right that’s consistent with when i published on the black hole and so on it was all within a couple of years of that rickles so let me see if i can find it i have you giving a talk at the stevens meetings on… finkelstein it’s probably just i’d been thinking about these things for longer but i certainly met misner at those meetings rickles so in november  there’s you giving “spin without spin” maybe that’s something different “an ordinary unified theory simplified by spinors” finkelstein oh yeah i think i did… yes as rehearsal for the spin of gravity i looked at other classical models for spin i asked what kinds of bodies could by their rotation have spin that was another warmup exercise rickles yeah because your first paper in ‘ was on the internal structure of spinning particles finkelstein that’s right i asked what kind of particles acted on by the lorentz group — particles not in the modern sense but in the sense of structures what invariant objects could have spin for example the sphere can’t because it doesn’t have enough markers rotation of the sphere is trivial a tetrahedron with relativistic analog or pentahedron could if you mark vertices so you can tell they’ve turned around i came up with a handful or a small handful of theories that can have spin for example a field described by a null electromagnetic field eib the field of a light wave if you just imagine an object with that attached to it it could have spin if they’re orthogonal if it’s a null vector rickles so where do you think that — finkelstein and of course if you apply tensor analysis the usual if you just look at the indices you wouldn’t think it could have spin so that was encouraging rickles actually i have that you did a paper called “on relations between commutators” finkelstein that’s different that grew out of my interest in quantum logic rickles right so the past — finkelstein i thought everything had to be done noncommutative and the first thing you learn is calculus so you’re getting noncommutative calculus and the core of that was provided by h s green who at that time i believe was in australia already i pulled that out of his paper and expanded it into a proof of the wellknown theorem about expanding a product of two exponentials as an exponential of the name of that theorem that i’m forgetting it comes up again and again in the old parts of quantum field theory eaxeb  eab  a half the commutator of a and b and so on into higher powers of course the name is in the paper rickles i’ll check that okay so that was kind of a separate research project then whereas the — finkelstein it’s all along the line of trying to quantize everything that moves including the kitchen sink rickles so the “pastfuture asymmetry of the gravitational field” paper so that was ‘ finkelstein that came out of the spin gravity overlapping voices rickles was that in the discussion with misner or was that a different paper than misner finkelstein i discovered the spin with misner definitely and then i looked at the simplest model the simplest gravitational field whose rotation could do that and it looked like this here are the light cones at infinity and they tilt toward the horizon like this and then they meet there if you have this happening in every radius so it’s spherically symmetric then that generates the homotopy group of the gravitational fields every gravitational field is made of these and their antiparticles the time reversals looking at it it was clearly not symmetric under time reversal you could see that because you could go in but you couldn’t get out that really scared me because this birkhoff theorem which says that if it’s stationary and spherical at infinity it’s static no difference between past and future but that’s a folk theorem if you look carefully at birkhoff’s theorem one way to say it is that if it’s spherical and static at infinity spherical and stationary to infinity it may static down to the first point where the time axis is a generator of the light cone down to the horizon so birkhoff’s theorem already says that if you look for coordinates that makes it static everywhere it will blow up at the horizon if you want to go through the horizon you just have to go back to a coordinate system where the light cones are allowed to rotate so he put in — that means a cross term in space and time so he put in a variable one of the simplest kind and just adjusted it to eliminate the singularity of schwarzschild it took a few minutes so that’s a byproduct of the search for spin in gravity rickles so it mentions you discuss that with stachel and anderson and bruce crabtree and melvin hausner as well so were they all at stevens at the time finkelstein hausner was at nyu stachel was my graduate student at stevens who else did you mention rickles bruce crabtree finkelstein bruce crabtree was on the faculty at stevens rickles yeah and anderson as well finkelstein and anderson too rickles i should have asked him what was stachel working on he was doing a master’s thesis wasn’t he finkelstein right rickles was it a general relativity problem finkelstein i’m trying to remember whether i inflicted quantum logic on him now or… rickles he has a paper on quantum logic somewhere finkelstein i don’t think he liked — no he didn’t like the idea of quantum logic i’m sure he didn’t write on it for one thing real marxists think that quantum theory is idealistic and conflicts with the doctrines of marx namely the goal of physics is to control the universe and if heisenberg were right there would be limits to that control if you meet limits you simply have to try harder i don’t know if they had the same problem with relativity and the speed of light i think stachel has completely healed since then rickles laughs he seems to he seems to have i’ll try and get the chronology right so in fifty… so misner was working on this rainich theory did you discuss the rainich theory he already overlapping voices finkelstein no we didn’t i knew of his work on it rickles so i’m just trying to work out when you must have met misner because i think it must have been… finkelstein it was certainly an important meeting for it let me think a minute rickles it must have been earlier because i remember misner and wheeler had this “annals of physics” paper on geometrodynamics in ‘ but it would have been written in ‘ that had all the homology stuff in it and he was doing betti numbers and all this kind of stuff so maybe would you have read that do you think when it came out finkelstein i’m sure i read it yeah rickles and then i’m just wondering if there were already some sort of back and forth between princeton and stevens because wheeler gets interested in relativity in about ‘ right quite late finkelstein i’m sorry rickles john wheeler started looking at relativity in about  finkelstein right rickles he was sort of traveling all over the place trying to find things so i’m just wondering if he went over to stevens quite early on and maybe took misner with him or something finkelstein i don’t remember him coming to stevens except for the relativity meeting but it could have escaped my memory rickles okay so do you remember also misner’s feynman quantization approach did you have any interest in — finkelstein oh yeah i did of course i studied that very carefully i read both dirac’s and feynman’s papers rickles so the way you look at that work is the idea to get to use the multiplyconnected spacetime to get the right kind of particles there because i’ve often wondered why he was doing feynman quantization finkelstein of course when feynman wrote he built on classical spacetime and that meant that a lot of his mathematics were meaningless you can’t really do those intervals over the paths i think of that more as a research program than a theory and in fact he discretized his space and time in order to get answers and then went to the limit of the continuum of zero spacing i’ve wanted to… i think that spacetime is built of atoms — quantum atoms of course i even named them in anticipation so all the procedures of renormalization i consider to be kind of irrelevant renormalization will survive as a physical process just as you have the  shielding in a plasma that’s a renormalization of charge but it won’t be infinite rickles so on the path — since you had this… did you already have the discrete idea at stevens then finkelstein oh i don’t think it was discrete ever i think it was quantum which is neither discrete nor continuous i think in terms of a hasse diagram or a lattice diagram and in classical physics they’re exactly as high as they are wide if you have a coin flip it’s… the diagram is a square empty — the false the true and the two heads and tails so it’s two wide and two high and that’s true for all boolean algebra then in quantum physics you have two high but instead of just two points there’s a whole circle rickles yeah overlapping voices  — finkelstein so it’s constant  rickles yeah because you’ve got these extra superposition unless it goes here finkelstein right you have all those super… so a point and a point and then you have the continuous circle so divertingly discrete and horizontally continuous so is that continuous or discrete yes laughs rickles i’m just trying to think in terms of looking at the path interval approach whether you had any instinct to try and — finkelstein as far as i’m concerned the path interval is just an operated product if you look at the product of several operators a b c d and put the indices in then one way of looking at that summation is as a sum of all the paths joining the indices i’m sure that’s how the feynman path emerges from a more quantum theory — just an operator product the important thing is that the thing you’re multiplying is the exponential of a classical phase of a classical action that dirac saw analogy and feynman saw an exactness but couldn’t express it because of his commitment to the continuum i’m sure that’s going to survive rickles but you’ll have a different measure because i’m just wondering if you… there are elements of your work especially when you get to the spacetime code papers that look very much like causal set theory i’m just trying to figure out whether there were some causal set kinds of things going on earlier finkelstein that was… what’s the name again rickles dantzig finkelstein causal sets rickles sorkin finkelstein right rafael sorkin i think i put him on to causal sets in doing the homotopy analysis of gravity i realized that what counted were the light cones and they in turn just expressed the causal relation so i defined the manifold by a causal relation and revol’t pimenov picked up on this in russia and wrote a book about… rickles pimenov finkelstein at the time he was in a concentration camp he was guilty of selfpublication he was quite famous and got a high position when stalin died and things liberalized he refers to my work on causal spaces very generously i had hoped to meet him sometime but was never fortunate rickles did you know about van dantzig’s work on… finkelstein numbered language of science oh no i’m thinking of — rickles david van dantzig i think that’s his name he has his paper in the… do you know the  berne conference for einstein there was this paper by van dantzig finkelstein which conference rickles the berne conference the jubilee of relativity  finkelstein oh yes rickles there’s a paper by van dantzig where he has this kind of… finkelstein i’m not quite recognizing the name of the town as you say it rickles switzerland berne finkelstein oh oh no let’s see no i was thinking of a warsaw conference rickles oh jablonna finkelstein jablonna okay no i wasn’t at the conference you mentioned and the name van dantzig is kind of new to me rickles hmm okay finkelstein should i look at it rickles maybe i can send you a copy finkelstein oh please do what kinds of things did he do rickles well almost came up with a similar idea to causal set theory the idea that you modeled spacetime by discrete structure that has a property — finkelstein the problem with the theory of causal sets… rickles partial overlapping voices finkelstein …is that it’s leaving quantization for the end rickles yeah overlapping voices finkelstein it’s building the theory classically and it’s true every quantum theory has some kind of classical skeleton so it’s okay but you shouldn’t… surely there must be some important physical effects that you discover only after the quantum theory is turned on rickles actually another person who springs to mind talking about that is von weizsäcker finkelstein i mean if action means phase of the wave function how can you possibly do dynamics on it before you have wave functions with phases rickles that’s true did you have any knowledge of von weizsäcker’s work then finkelstein oh we were very close rickles long ago or when finkelstein i remember our first meeting i think i think he was attracted by my work in quantum logic right yes he too was struck by the fact that the lorentz group is sl which is the group of a twocomponent complex vector which means that it’s a quantum logic and because a twocone vector it’s the quantum theory of a binary choice so both of us arrived at the idea that therefore spacetime is a collection of binary decisions i think he did it before me i’m sure he did where did we meet i guess he invited me to a conference he had this annual series quantum theories of space and time and i think i went to all of them or all but one i was in his home often and he in mine i visited him after he had alzheimer’s and probably one of the last visits to pay respects to him we were brought together in some of the… well through him i met heinrich saller rickles is that zoller finkelstein pardon rickles how do you spell that name finkelstein saller i guess it’s heinrich saller actually rickles okay i don’t know that name finkelstein who is still alive and well he retired from the heisenberg — he worked with heisenberg and retired from the heisenberg institute rather recently but he now edits the journal i used to edit rickles yeah we’ll maybe get to that in a bit so back to stevens and black holes finkelstein right rickles did penrose visit stevens before you — i take it you went to king’s finkelstein the first time i ever saw him was in london rickles at king’s college was it finkelstein yeah we were introduced by dennis sciama rickles yeah before that did felix pirani visit you at stevens because obviously felix was at king’s i’m wondering if it was felix that invited you back finkelstein my offhand impression the best i can remember is that i met him at king’s rickles felix at king’s as well right finkelstein i’m not sure of that rickles how did you get the invite to king’s do you remember finkelstein it wasn’t especially king’s for me i had met sciama at the meetings rickles ah okay so sciama finkelstein and he wanted me to meet penrose so he set it up and it happened to be at king’s rickles so sciama was at the stevens meetings finkelstein i think so how else could… yeah rickles so was bondi i think maybe bondi was unintelligible finkelstein let me see oh it’s true no i don’t remember sciama being at a stevens meeting we could have met at a relativity meeting rickles so pirani was at the stevens meetings okay finkelstein i know i had close conversations and friendly conversations with sciama but i think it was in europe or england rickles oh yes so you went to royaumont you say as well finkelstein then after i did my own black hole work sciama wanted me to meet penrose it was at king’s that i showed roger the black hole and he showed me the spin networks i was really trying to quantize spacetime but from the bottom up the idea that one could just learn from spin something useful about spacetime the idea of building it from spins i really learned from him i’m not sure how long it would have taken me to have the courage to do that rickles yeah he didn’t — finkelstein so that was an important meeting for me rickles so did he have his manuscripts the spin networks manuscript by then or was it just ideas finkelstein off the cuff oh he had had the manuscripts i’m sure he did but first he didn’t call them spin networks he called them mops rickles mops finkelstein right rickles because they’ve got all the strands coming off them and they intertwine whatever they are he called them mops that’s interesting finkelstein but there was an important exchange interaction he walked away with a black hole and i walked away with spin networks we will probably meet again rickles yeah he never really did anything beyond that with his spin networks i suppose but you did the black hole finkelstein oh it stimulated a lot of people rickles yeah oh yeah finkelstein well he did he made twistors rickles that’s true finkelstein except that twistors have nonlinear it means he already gave up quantum theory he probably didn’t realize he was giving it up rickles so when you were in england were you visiting king’s as a research visitor or you were just passing through to give a talk finkelstein i was there because i had a fellowship at cern i was stationed in geneva for a year and on a sabbatical from stevens rickles right and the royaumont must have happened around then as well so that’s… finkelstein no i think royaumont i added across the ocean i think i came to royaumont from this country yeah i remember that rickles all right so cern then so why cern why did you go to cern finkelstein as a result of my work on plasmas at nyu i became interested in budker’s idea of relativistic pinches he thought of them not so much with thermonuclear application but as guide fields for tablesized synchrotron… tablesized cosmotron if you have a current loop of relativistic particles traveling one way and antiparticles traveling the other way so you have a relativistic current the magnetic field is strong focusing at all points you don’t even have to have an alternating gradient it just focuses the pinch effect focuses anything you put in it i call it a budker accelerator and i wanted to build one or at least take a step toward building one you have to begin by designing a field coil that will hold such a relativistic pinch in place i have a patent on a single turn high field betatron which i call the megatron because the field is about a megagauss i knew that the accelerator group at cern would have experts that could help me in that area and the ford foundation funded me for a year at cern it was there i met david spizer first of all and… rickles jauch finkelstein and jauch exactly who became interested in the quantum logic approach and wrote on it rickles yeah i studied his book as a master’s student actually so where did that project go what happened to it finkelstein well first i’m afraid i didn’t enjoy the mathematics of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics that much and probably if i had tried to solve the problem theoretically i’d still be working on it so i decided to try and build one and see what happens and that i did at stevens with help from bostick who showed me how to put together vacuum systems and so on then it became clear that the circular machine was unstable i didn’t push it as hard as i could it might be possible to stabilize it but that would be… he had no other project on top of the project lifelong pursuit so anyway that’s what brought me to cern rickles okay i mean you mentioned in — finkelstein then at yeshiva i went straight namely i thought a straight pinch would have less of a stability problem indeed the whole thing only lasts for an instant maybe you can do what you want to do before it disappears and learn a little bit about relativistic pinches and use that for further work so i built a linear machine and that picture you saw was of my linear work at yeshiva rickles that was at yeshiva okay finkelstein i put together a little capacitor back in richard  system rickles let’s see you’ll have to tell me what… what’s it called the exact — finkelstein the thing that… the round one called the megatron rickles what is the name of the — finkelstein oh see there were just the control instruments rickles for finkelstein for or most of it said linear pinch weakly relativistic  mev my students assembled a capacitor bank at  volts and built a stepup transformer to charge the water capacitor to a million volts and then discharge that into the pinch rickles did you discuss any of this with kruskal he used to work on this on plasmas and… finkelstein i think… rickles i mean did you have any — finkelstein kruskal and i had two major overlaps first his work on solitons helped me think about the simplest example of a topologically nontrivial field which also led to something like solitons i called mine topological solitons to distinguish them from his where the soliton was held together purely by dynamics so we had sort of casual interaction because of the similarity of that work the important thing is that after i found my regularization of the schwarzschild singularity at one of the plasma meetings i showed it to him and he immediately took out an envelope and sketched a regularization of my solution i had only half of the complete solution and he had worked it out as a homework exercise in a general relativity course he had taken years ago and never thought it was worth publishing rickles so that presumably was with wheeler right he was with john wheeler wasn’t he was he a grad student of wheeler’s finkelstein no not particularly no no he was quite… he was working for the plasma group for years oh at the time he did his relativity homework i have no idea who he was studying with rickles yeah that’s what i… because i heard a story that the kruskal paper with his diagrams — finkelstein that came later namely after i published my paper which footnotes kruskal and the kruskal solution became known he still wasn’t publishing and the way i hear it is that wheeler finally wrote the paper and got kruskal to sign it rickles yeah that’s what i heard yeah okay so you’re in discussions with kruskal when you were writing the kinks paper is that right or was it later finkelstein yes rickles so misner and kruskal finkelstein right rickles okay and you called your horizon a unidirectional membrane finkelstein right rickles do you remember who came up with the name horizon finkelstein horizon to me sounds like penrose i’m pretty sure he was the one who called it horizon rickles so do you remember giving the schwarzschild solution paper at the stevens meetings rehearsing it finkelstein i imagine i did that’s funny i actually don’t remember doing that i’m pretty sure i gave it at royaumont that i could check by looking at their volume rickles what do you remember of the relativity seminars finkelstein rather little actually misner spoke on the problem of the dynamics of general relativity and particularly the huge number of constraints that come up in the theory i remember later on he spoke he gave a general colloquium at princeton and oppenheimer was in the audience misner pointed out that in general relativity the hamiltonian has to vanish identically because changing time is just a change of coordinates and oppenheimer didn’t get it he asked some not terribly intelligent questions and finally the thing had to go ahead rickles i’d heard dirac had a problem with that as well was that your recollection finkelstein not that i — that was the main problem he solved the problem of constraints rickles oh no but i’m thinking of the idea that the hamiltonian vanishes he had a problem with the idea that you’d have things commuting with — finkelstein he was the first person to deal with it i think actually i’m not quite sure it comes up really if you try and quantize gravity there’s no particular need to do a hamiltonian theory with the classical theory i don’t know who tried to quantize gravity first bergmann or dirac rickles oh it was bergmann dirac’s was quite late actually ‘ finkelstein that was my impression also yes thank you the problem of a hamiltonian theory with such strong constraints was handled more geometrically by dirac so it could be understood rickles yeah so i mean dirac was looking at just lorentz invariant theories when he was doing those lectures on constraints okay so you didn’t have any hand in the running of the relativity seminars finkelstein i believe not rickles it was just all schiller and anderson finkelstein yes rickles so i’m wondering how much of wheeler’s idea of geons and getting spin from funny topological solutions fed into your work or whether you were already — finkelstein well he didn’t say topological i don’t think geon was just a collection of a light field bound by its gravitational field rickles oh but then he sort of had… finkelstein oh wormholes rickles yeah exactly so it sort of drifted from that into a more general program finkelstein right rickles the way i saw it wheeler was after spin basically so he had dieter brill working on trying to get spin finkelstein see i didn’t know that or maybe i did and i forgot rickles yeah i’m curious because it seems like you were sort of doing work that was directly relevant to what wheeler was after from what i could see finkelstein right rickles but maybe i’m just curious why misner didn’t relay that as well also the “spin without spin” title was that yours because that sounds quite wheelerish it’s a wheelerism finkelstein i don’t know i don’t think i would have put it that way that’s a wheelerism rickles it’s a wheelerism actually this is from dieter brill’s notes so i had a bunch of his notes where he’d taken titles down so maybe he’d just come up with that title being a wheeler student finkelstein right rickles do you remember oskar klein he visited stevens around march  finkelstein who rickles oskar klein finkelstein my goodness i don’t rickles he was talking about fivedimensional relativity and eddington finkelstein yes rickles you don’t remember that one who else do we have arthur komar he was at stevens as well for a bit right finkelstein i should have mentioned his name well he wasn’t at stevens rickles oh he was syracuse wasn’t he he stayed — finkelstein i know him mainly from yeshiva rickles ah he went there okay finkelstein we were colleagues there for many years rickles yes did you discuss his… because he had his own particular approach where he was trying to get physical invariant coordinates for general relativity did you discuss that approach with him did you buy into it finkelstein i’m sure i did komar and i spoke quite often i think his idea of general relativistic hamiltonian and its dependence on the observer i think they’re right on people looking for the right stress tensor are probably misguided trying to make general relativity too much like special relativity i think arthur understood that very well rickles so you didn’t get tempted by any of the approaches because obviously bergmann’s school must have been quite a strong — finkelstein they’re all working classical spacetime and that’s drowning the baby in the bathwater rickles yeah who else was doing kind of pure approaches to quantum gravity at the time or quantum spacetime gravity finkelstein by pure you mean quantizing spacetime too rickles yes finkelstein i’ve tried to trace back the story of quantum spacetime significantly and not connected especially through general relativity heisenberg was probably the first to suggest it and his idea was carried by people along paths that were pretty welldefined rickles yeah i think now there’s the snyder paper right hartland snyder’s paper overlapping voices finkelstein wess is a very good man to speak to on this question of how the ideas got from heisenberg to snyder to in russia… rickles dmitri ivanenko finkelstein ivanenko exactly yes and yang finally because i think he had— rickles oh he had his lattice thing didn’t he a lattice theory is that right finkelstein no no no rickles i was thinking of lee t d lee finkelstein yang looked at what snyder had done rickles i didn’t know that finkelstein and it’s either the same year or the next… i think it was a very important paper yang published it in  i believe no sorry ‘ ‘ was when feynman tackled quantum spacetime and didn’t publish it as far as i know or as far as he knew the idea of expressing spacetime in terms of spins as far as i know begins with feynman there’s a formula he wrote down while he was still a graduate student before he went to work for bethe on qed namely x  γγ x is the sum of a lot of gammas that’s obviously the lorentz invariant he showed me that when i was at yeshiva i was sidetracked a little bit by the phenomenon of ball lightning that came out of the plasma groups rickles i see finkelstein one of the russians thought that ball lightning might be a natural fusion reactor held together by its own magnetic field so i generalized the virial theorem to relativistic theory and showed the pressure inside a configuration of plasma and electromagnetic fields couldn’t exceed the pressure outside there was no significant confinement i’ve lost my train of thought now rickles we were talking about the development of quantum spacetime and then feynman at yeshiva finkelstein quantum spacetime right rickles so feynman had this approach in his notebook but he told you about it at yeshiva it’s strange how — finkelstein i don’t quite see why i drifted off onto ball lightning rickles because it looked like he had a… oh because you were doing that at yeshiva as well you got — finkelstein right oh yes i was thinking how i came to be in feynman’s office namely i went out to measure the conductivity of the rocks beneath the mohave desert and since i was in pasadena i just took a chance and went to feynman’s office he wasn’t there but as i was leaving it he was approaching it i recognized him and introduced myself and he said “oh the rabbi” which is not exactly a good description but… he associated me with yeshiva university he took me to his office and as much as i was afraid of imposing on his time he kept me there for hours it was one of the experiences of my life i showed him a little bit about quantum logic which he enjoyed and he showed me this formula and he asked me why i think he gave it up i didn’t have the nerve to say if i’d been feynman i would have said “you sold out for the nobel prize” i said “i couldn’t imagine” and he said “because it’s too difficult” but anyway that’s how i came to the feynman formula and that really affected my subsequent work greatly rickles so is that what you call a bergmann manifold this idea that feynman had finkelstein a what manifold rickles bergmann manifold finkelstein why would that be called a bergmann manifold rickles well a manifold with spins finkelstein oh no he didn’t have a manifold that you put spins on no his formula is x itself is a sum of spin operators rickles right okay finkelstein in a bergmann manifold you have the same x as in the other manifold and then you put spins which are other independent variables on top of them this i call a feynman spacetime where the points themselves are assemblies of spins he did this in  i think i saw that formula in a footnote to one of his papers but i can’t trace it he thought so too and he couldn’t trace it rickles hmm i’ll check into it finkelstein he didn’t write it x  σγ he wrote it as x  γγ and so on those ones and twos aren’t the usual subscripts on the γ usually it was γ of  γ of  they’re different spin operators presumably commuting with each other rickles it’s funny feynman does seem to have done general relativity throughout but just not published on it he mentions in various places in his correspondence he’s been working hard on general relativity but you don’t see it anywhere finkelstein well he did publish a little rickles yeah in the late ‘s and early ‘s but he’d been working on it for a long time before that apparently finkelstein yes rickles i also found in his notebooks with ted welton when he was at mit they worked through eddington’s book actually and they even discuss quantum gravity theodore welton says basically “let’s try and do quantum gravity” and feynman writes in the margin “way too hard” back then as well but he kept coming back to it finkelstein anyway after feynman the next important paper along these lines for me of course is snyder then yang looks at snyder sees that the lie algebra is not very pretty and mathematically speaking it’s not simple i’m not sure it’s even semisimple no it isn’t it’s singular the basic quadratic form the pointing… oh no the killing form is singular and he fixes it he suggests that a rotation group like so  for example would have among its generators operators that could serve not only for the operators of the poincaré group like momentum and rotation but also the coordinates themselves the x’s could be rotation operators in this higher dimensional space so he’s looking now not at a symmetry group so much as a dynamical group of variables so  he never actually pinned down whether it was so  or so  but some sixdimensional group of we necessarily have an indefinite metric could be what underlies not the poincaré group but the heisenberg poincaré lie algebra the algebra you need for a particle in spacetime this was before gauge theory was the rage wigner defined a particle as a representation of the poincaré group but you can’t do gauge physics if you don’t have an x operator and his particles didn’t have x’s they just had the poincaré operators if he’d built an x it wouldn’t be an observable it wouldn’t even be local so yang was really ahead of his time insisting that particles have to have x’s not just the poincaré group as if he’s getting ready to do yangmills theory you can’t do a gauge theory without x’s so yang put down this rather beautiful theory postulating simple lie groups but in my opinion he lost his nerve halfway through he represented these groups in the same way snyder did in hilbert space whose unitary group is not simple so on the one hand he’s looking through into the magic garden of simple groups but he’s not willing to go there yet then later i spoke at his institute at stony brook and described his earlier work none of his students had ever heard of it rickles i can’t believe i’ve never heard of this finkelstein pardon rickles i can’t believe i’ve not heard of this paper finkelstein it’s incredible rickles i trawled everywhere looking for this type of work i know schild’s paper on the discrete approaches but i’ve never even heard of this it’s just crazy finkelstein right very few people have i think it’s a crucial paper it’s the first simple group and now if you simply combine yang and feynman instead of representing his group with hilbert space you simply represent it with a bunch of spins the spinning spinors are now spins of so  or so  you put your money on your bet and you take your chances i waffle some days i use so  and some days i use so  i have a general prejudice of mathematical origin in favor of neutral metrics learned from cantor who based his theory of spinors on neutral metrics rickles cartan finkelstein cartan thank you very much i keep confusing cantor and cartan they’re almost anagrams i guess i’m a little bit dyslexic rickles okay how are you feeling in terms of… we’ve been going for two hours that’s pretty good going i mean i’ve… where did i want to get to i’d like to say a bit more about yeshiva talk a bit more about yeshiva and the spacetime code stuff would be good i don’t know i’m happy to go that far if you want to carry on and talk about more things that’s fine that’s good finkelstein no no rickles i don’t want to keep you too long the ball lightning thing got me curious how did that actually come about how did you decide — finkelstein well it was this russian proposal that ball — i was in plasma ball lightning is a natural thermonuclear reactor maybe so i had to look into it rickles oh so you were sort of officially working on plasma physics finkelstein at yeshiva at a laboratory rickles right okay i didn’t know that finkelstein i was trying to make a relativistic pinch rickles ah okay right that makes sense now finkelstein a budker machine a linear one to begin with rickles yeah i noticed you returned… finkelstein i think it was at cern that i… there was one more bit of apprenticeship namely there’s the question of the underlying field of quantum theory if you’re generalizing you have to consider all the possibilities rickles you mean number field finkelstein birkhoff and von neumann had pointed out that r c and the quaternions are the natural fields for projected geometry quaternions are attracted because they’re even more noncommutative more quantum than the real and complex quantum theories so at geneva i worked with spizer and jauch on quaternion quantum mechanics and immediately ran into the problem that there’s no respectable theory of the tensor product over the quaternion field which means you can’t do statistics without breaking the symmetry and breaking the field down to the complex or the reals and you can write schrödinger’s equation but that involves singling out an i rickles so what’s the problem with doing tensor product quaternion finkelstein a tensor product of two vector spaces can be expressed in terms of functions which are bilinear linear in both factors separately a bilinear function over the quaternions vanishes identically because if you can shoot you can multiply the first coefficient by i… first space by i the second by j or you can multiply the first by j and the second — you’re supposed to get the same thing either way and you don’t if you do you get zero rickles yes finkelstein so you have to break the symmetry you have to single out one quaternion if you want to preserve the quaternionic symmetry then you have to introduce into this a new physical variable rickles that will distinguish it finkelstein you could say as an imaginary unit which depends on space and time in the way the gravitational field gives you a local lorentz group but breaks the global one so you’d have a local quaternion group but you’d break the global one so to gauge theory and this singling out of the i leads to a gauge boson with mass i’m afraid i’m another one of the infinite number of people who did the higgs field before higgs rickles laughter right finkelstein but i gather the fact that i used quaternion language meant that nobody could read the paper those were the good olden days now physicists aren’t too well educated in mathematics rickles you didn’t go there to work with jauch though right you were working on something completely different did you know about jauch finkelstein did i know about…  rickles about jauch and spizer before that finkelstein i didn’t know them before i went to cern no rickles so how did you get to working with these guys finkelstein well of course i didn’t give up my interests youk had written this marvelous book on electrodynamics rickles so he’d already… finkelstein i knew of him i just went out of my way to meet him i showed him my work on quantum logic and he was one of the few people who — in fact he’s probably the only reputable physicist who listened to me well feynman rickles yeah so during that stage — finkelstein feynman came later jauch was at the time the only one rickles because especially in cern things were going very heavily datadriven right so ps had just started finkelstein well jauch wasn’t at cern so much he was at the university of geneva he was much more theoretical rickles okay so do you remember how this kind of work was viewed at the time finkelstein i wasn’t in the particle group i had virtually no interaction with them i was often alone rickles where were you based did you have an office over there finkelstein overlapping voices development group rickles and you had like shared office or overlapping voices finkelstein i had an office there i don’t think we shared i think i had my own office david spizer and i would meet there sometimes and sometimes at the university rickles were you giving talks or anything at cern was there a kind of research meeting group there at cern finkelstein i published in the cern series there’s a sequence of three or four papers on quaternion quantum mechanics which are printable in their archives if you need to look them up rickles i got them i think finkelstein if you do they’re photographically garbled it wasn’t a complete set of — rickles i think i’m missing two or no maybe — finkelstein and the bottom of the pages is missing and so on rickles yeah exactly it’s like quite a multipart series right finkelstein it got published later what’s the name of this australian philosopher hooker rickles yeah cliff hooker finkelstein cliff hooker put the whole quaternion sequence in one of his— rickles he had the quantum logic book yeah finkelstein right do you ever see cliff hooker rickles i do actually i’ve seen him quite recently i just did something for a book he edited in fact on complex systems finkelstein give him my regards rickles i will finkelstein i really liked him very much i’m sorry we’re out of touch rickles i had no idea you knew cliff hooker but yes finkelstein i think we got on well rickles he’s a nice guy so did this set you back on the path of the logic of quantum mechanics finkelstein the quaternion quantum mechanics helped me because you look at the lattices and so on and you have to make sure you really have to think about quantum mechanics fresh if you change the underlying number system those are very helpful rickles it looks like you were sort of drifting to general relativistic things and then cern happens and these papers happen and then you change direction really is what it looks like from the publication records finkelstein well no i wasn’t drifting toward general relativity the thing was purely an exercise on the way to quantize spacetime i had hoped to show you couldn’t get spin½ from general relativity it turns out you can but the hell with it that’s not where it comes from i mean the real problem is to quantize spacetime it would be nice to know you had to but you still have to rickles so was there any kind of overlap between stevens and yeshiva it seems like you were… i thought you were sort of — finkelstein first joel lebowitz was the first to go from stevens to yeshiva he was the first physicist they hired and he created the department and was elected head from the very beginning he hired me from stevens and we’re still good friends rickles was it a teaching institute then were you teaching or was it grad students finkelstein it was the belfer graduate school of science rickles right so you were teaching courses to grad students finkelstein right and we… no i taught undergraduates also that involved crossing a street rickles what was that finkelstein that involved crossing a street rickles okay to go to the — laughing finkelstein amsterdam avenue runs right through the campus and the religious buildings are on one side and the school of science is on the other rickles yeah actually susskind in one of his books paints a nice picture of the early days of yeshiva as very highly orthodox finkelstein not highly orthodox but if they were highly orthodox we wouldn’t have been there they run the albert einstein college of medicine rickles susskind says that you arranged his job interview actually finkelstein i arranged — yeah rickles is that right did you interview him or just you hired him finkelstein yeah i was out in california we met and he’s obviously promising we were very lucky that he agreed to come rickles so he must have been working on — was he working on hadrons was he an smatrix guy i forget whether he was doing smatrix stuff i know he was doing — finkelstein i think he was already into string theory rickles i think… no so string theory… i think he went there in about ‘ he says so string theory is… finkelstein sounds late rickles …‘ you get the dual resonance model stuff and then ‘ is when susskind writes his strings paper so i’m just wondering what… maybe he was working on hadrons finkelstein well you know sometimes people work for years on an idea before they publish there’s work on the smatrix which compares the amplitudes for two experiments which can really be easily related to each other only if you think of them as string interactions rickles yeah but the dhs duality the dual resonance rosnerharari kind of… finkelstein exactly and he was either doing that when we met or very soon after rickles okay so he was already looking along those lines that’s interesting yeah okay because i thought he waited for the veneziano paper i know he then started looking at that but it sounds like maybe he — finkelstein it could be my impression is that he was in that kind of deformation early rickles so other people there i suppose you had dirac there for a while did — finkelstein his office was next to mine rickles ah okay did you speak finkelstein once rickles that’s quite a lot compared to most… laughs finkelstein we just couldn’t stop gabbing rickles so was that about quantum gravity or anything finkelstein yeah we quickly came to — he turned the conversation quickly to the question of which is more the fundamental physical constant e or h he gave an argument i guess i knew about it before and maybe i brought it up because i don’t believe it he said that e was more fundamental and his argument is that if h were more fundamental the formula for e would involve a square root e is the square root of  rickles yeah that’s a very eddingtonian… finkelstein hc and fundamental laws can’t involve square roots but from my work in quaternion quantum mechanics i already knew that e never appears in physics in fact in weyl’s book on electromagnetism he absorbs an e into the vector potential so it’s not there in the coupling between the vector potential and the electron it appears then only in one place in front of the maxwell action of course it appears there as e and physically how could e appear by itself you only know about it from forces between two e’s he heard me out politely and said nevertheless he still thinks that e is more fundamental still he is not going to look for a formula expressing e in terms of h and c but he’s going to try and express h in terms of e and c that means he didn’t think quantum theory was fundamental beneath it he thinks there’s a more classical kind of theory and that h maybe like einstein thought represents instabilities in the classical nonlinear field this is i think shown in his book on quantum theory which is epical but is not operational he never says what operations correspond to his state vector any more than von neumann does it’s perfectly clear from heisenberg’s work that the state vector represents an input port or input beam and dual is the output beam and the basic born formula is a description of the experiment so it’s a very pragmatic theory and anyone who thinks it needs an interpretation just means he hasn’t absorbed its interpretation but you couldn’t be checking it against experiment as beautifully as we do if it didn’t come with its interpretation now any paper on the interpretation of quantum physics is a confession by the author “i don’t understand quantum theory” there’s a paper to this effect in physics today by a good friend of mine unfortunately deceased from israel rickles is it a philosopher finkelstein no a physics major rickles asher peres finkelstein exactly thank you you’re inexhaustible rickles laughs yeah i know that paper finkelstein he had a paper saying quantum theory needs no interpretation he’s right on except i don’t think he gives the interpretation it’s okay you can’t get everything in one rickles no but he did have that viewpoint in mind actually finkelstein right rickles yeah so did you host penrose as well and i heard aharonov was there was aharonov there when you were there finkelstein penrose may have passed through rickles he wasn’t a visitor finkelstein but he wasn’t on the faculty and who did you ask about rickles aharonov yakir finkelstein yes aharonov got his first job outside israel at yeshiva essentially he was sent by bohm whom i still respect and was happy at yeshiva for quite a few years rickles actually on bohm did you have any interactions with bohm finkelstein oh very strong rickles was he a visitor i mean he had trouble in overlapping voices finkelstein not at yeshiva but when i spent a sabbatical at oxford bohm would come down from london very often we’d walk by the river and talk for hours rickles yeah i stumbled across a paper of his recently from i think it was late ‘s where he had an almost causal set kind of approach as well have you seen this paper i should send it to you if you don’t know it because there are some very similar ideas to some of your stuff finkelstein i was especially influenced by his thinking about simplicial complexes he recognized that the use of the grassmann algebras were really theories of simplicial complexes i don’t think it was a very common idea at the time if you look in chevalley’s book on modern concepts he points out that the theory of simplicial complexes is an exercise in grassmann algebra what bohm adds to that is that means it must have to do with fermi statistics and he was right on i once asked him how he could possibly do his work on causal theories of quantum theory and yet have this understanding of quantum theory he explained he wasn’t trying to get rid of quantum theory he was trying to show there must be levels beneath it rickles how they merged finkelstein the only catch is then why was he making them look so classical to look more like a return to old thoughts than pursuing the revolutionary road and he never answered but his theory like all the other attempts to make classical interpretations of ψ fail on one question if ψ is really an object the physical thing out there how come it acts as a statistical distribution how come it gives probabilities this is the failure of all those theories to close that one last link is missing rickles so susskind mentions he remembers you having a debate with dirac actually at some stage finkelstein i think the one i just mentioned rickles no it was a different one where you were arguing about the zero point energy of empty space and whether it gravitates however it should gravitate and how that should be treated do you remember having that discussion finkelstein let me think i don’t remember that gee if i remembered it i would cherish it how did i lose it rickles he mentions this in… gosh which one is it finkelstein i can certainly see that happening it seems to me that dirac’s theory makes that zero point energy very natural it breaks the symmetry of the electron and positron rickles the time varying… finkelstein the vacuum is full of these things and heisenberg’s symmetrization is a bit of a gimmick he’s throwing away ad infinity so you can get any answer you like why should there be perfect symmetry between the two it’s begging the question it’s just saying let’s set the gravitational field equal to zero never mind what it really is rickles yeah okay i think i’m nearly done actually the spacetime code papers so how do you view this first spacetime code paper was it sort of a culmination of… finkelstein well first of all the point i was trying to get across was the idea of the world as a computer the more i think about that that could be taken too shallowly too simplistically but in classical physics you don’t have inputoutput systems you talk about the way the world is in computers you have an input and you have an output or you don’t have a computer and in quantum theory you have an input and an output or you don’t have a quantum theory so you’re much closer to the computer model than to the old platonic model of what physics is about i guess my paper on the world as computer is the first to appear in the literature the idea of a quantum computer in a paper i gave on one of those island meetings corsica it’s in a book edited by david spizer i suggested that the nature is computer and the individual electron spins were either good spins or the bits and that’s the idea of quantum memory but my quantum computer is more quantum than the industrial ones namely the addresses are quantum too the usual commercial quantum computers are located at macroscopic…the bits are located at macroscopic positions the classical addresses rickles in the spacetime code paper though you don’t have that kind of interpretation of quantum computer do you finkelstein i think when i wrote that paper… first of all it was before i met feynman so the idea that these abstract spin bits were actually spins was not comfortable for me i like to go slower that avoids making mistakes but it avoids a lot of inventions too i first had the courage to identify these things with spins after my meeting with feynman rickles so is that the paper where you get special relativity out the geometry of special relativity from quantum mechanics finkelstein getting it out i mean i knew it — let’s be realistic rickles derive finkelstein maybe building it in is another way to put it rickles right i’ll show it — yeah okay finkelstein i mean a prediction you can’t predict things you already know rickles laughs tell that to the string theorists actually did you not — finkelstein but i guess i wrote that paper before meeting weizsäcker so he and i were both influenced by the recognition that the group of special relativity is slc which is the group of a bit rickles okay and it was completely independent though yeah that’s interesting finkelstein he quoted rather often at his talks my statement that he was the first person to recognize this identity and he would then say that i could say that because i had done it independently rickles laughs okay did you not get tempted by some of the goings on in string theory susskind got quite into string theory early on you had no interest finkelstein first of all as soon as… i had this horrible two years after i discovered what i called kinks the solitons of the gravitational field because they’re finite objects how could they blow up it took a ridiculously long time for me to realize that there are still an infinite number of degrees of freedom that there was still a high frequently spectrum that you can’t make a physics just of kinks so there would always be divergences in a continuous field theory but still for a while the idea of doing a purely topological physics appealed to me in the paper by misner and me on topological conservation laws a vibrating string was the simplest example of solitons sorry it wasn’t a string it was a strip rickles yes that’s right and you did a twist it was like you gave a… finkelstein yeah right yeah so i was tempted by such ideas but if you like the lie algebras aren’t simple they violate yang’s principle rickles so that was — yeah because… in fact finkelstein they use hilbert space they’re as bad as any other field theory they’d pretend that there’s this cancellation between the fermion and the boson because they have two infinities isn’t infinity minus infinity zero if you want zero it’s zero sure but that’s the most stupid cancellation i’ve ever seen rickles were you aware of the mathematical side of string theory because the business of the monster sporadic group and leech lattices and all of that kind of thing was — finkelstein i didn’t follow that at all no susskind kept me in touch with witten’s developing ideas and they all seemed to be mathematicians’ fantasies they don’t come out of experiment and both general relativity and quantum theory of course are thoroughly based on very important experiments there hasn’t been a case really where a good theory was invented out of nothing maybe in his later years einstein drifted away from experiment but when he was making his great discoveries he was thinking very very hard about solid experiments even galileo’s rickles so what’s your view of… do you follow presentday quantum gravity approaches much finkelstein most of them use classical spacetime or… yeah it could be lattice or it could be manifold so i haven’t been following them much i keep in touch with the… i’m blocking names again ashtekar and smolin rickles the loop approach finkelstein right i really can’t find the theory i’ve tried to get it formulated as a mathematical theory but it seems to be more of a program it’s just they have a different program but loops sound like there’s a continuum down there that they’re using unless they’ve changed the word loop rickles yeah it’s not loops anymore they have essentially spin networks it’s called so yeah so they have su representations finkelstein right i believe the spin network still uses classical addresses so to speak rickles so the idea is what they say is — this is rovelli he says you have a manifold — finkelstein if they really believe that spin network that means they have a discrete spacetime rickles that’s what they think so they use a manifold as an auxiliary device to set the theory up and then psht finkelstein nothing up my sleeves rickles yeah exactly laughter okay i think we’ll end there this is excellent
