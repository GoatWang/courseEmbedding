some funds may not be available in certain states each fund is registered under the investment company act of  as an openend management investment company these funds are not publicly traded and are offered only through variable annuity and variable life insurance products and maybe in some instances certain retirement plans they are not the same retail mutual funds as those offered outside of a variable annuity or variable life insurance product although the investment practices and fund names may be similar and the portfolio managers may be identical accordingly the performance of the retail mutual fund is likely to be different from that of the fund we select the funds offered through this policy based on several criteria including asset class coverage the strength of the advisers or subadvisers reputation and tenure brand recognition performance and the capability and qualification of each investment firm another factor we consider during the selection process is whether the funds adviser or subadviser is one of our affiliates or whether the fund its adviser its subadvisers or an affiliate will make payments to us or our affiliates in this regard the profit distributions we receive from our affiliated investment advisers are a component of the total revenue that we consider in configuring the features and investment choices available in the variable insurance products that we and our affiliated insurance companies issue since we and our affiliated insurance companies may benefit more from the allocation of assets to portfolios advised by our affiliates than those that are not we may be more inclined to offer portfolios advised by our affiliates in the variable insurance products we issue for additional information on these arrangements see payments we receive we review the funds periodically and may remove a fund or limit its availability to new premiums andor transfers of cash value if we determine that the fund no longer meets one or more of the selection criteria andor if the fund has not attracted significant allocations from policy owners in some cases we have included funds based on recommendations made by brokerdealer firms we do not provide any investment advice and do not recommend or endorse any particular fund you bear the risk of any decline in the cash value of your policy resulting from the performance of the funds you have chosen if investment in the funds or a particular fund is no longer possible in our judgment becomes inappropriate for purposes of the policy or for any other reason in our sole discretion we may substitute another fund or funds without your consent the substituted fund may have different fees and expenses substitution may be made with respect to existing investments or the investment of future premiums or both however we will not make such substitution without any necessary approval of the securities and exchange commission and applicable state insurance departments furthermore we may close funds to allocations of premiums or cash value or both at any time in our sole discretion in certain circumstances the companys ability to remove or replace a fund may be limited by the terms of a fiveyear agreement between metlife inc metlife and legg mason inc legg mason relating to the use of certain funds advised by legg mason affiliates the agreement sets forth the conditions under which the company can remove a fund which in some cases may differ from the companys own selection criteria in addition during the term of the agreement subject to the companys fiduciary and other legal duties the company is generally obligated in the first instance to consider funds advised by legg mason affiliates in seeking to make a substitution for a fund advised by a legg mason

metlife insurance company of connecticut and the travelers life and annuity company now metlife life and annuity company of connecticut from citigroup legg mason replaced the citigroup affiliates as a party to the agreement when citigroup sold its asset management business to legg mason the agreement also obligates legg mason to continue making payments to us with respect to the funds advised by legg mason affiliates on the same terms provided for in administrative service agreements between citigroups asset management affiliates and the travelers insurance companies that predated the acquisition payments we receive as described above an investment adviser other than our affiliates metlife advisers llc and met investors advisory llc or subadviser of a fund or its affiliates may

on the next business day market timingexcessive trading the policy is intended for use as a longterm investment vehicle and is not designed to serve as a vehicle for excessive trading or market timing in an attempt to take advantage of shortterm fluctuations in the stock market frequent requests from policy owners to transfer cash value may dilute the value of a funds shares if the frequent trading involves an attempt to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies created by a lag between a change in the value of the securities held by the fund and the reflection of that change in the funds share price arbitrage trading regardless of the existence of pricing inefficiencies frequent transfers may also increase brokerage and administrative costs of the underlying funds and may disrupt fund management strategy requiring a fund to maintain a high cash position and possibly resulting in lost investment opportunities and forced liquidations disruptive trading accordingly arbitrage trading and disruptive trading activities referred to collectively as market timing may adversely affect the longterm performance of the funds which in turn adversely affect policy owners and other persons who may have an interest in the policies eg beneficiaries we have policies and procedures that attempt to detect and deter frequent transfers in situations where we determine there is a potential for arbitrage trading currently we believe that such situations may be presented in the international smallcap and highyield funds ie american funds global growth fund dreyfus variable investment fund

intend to treat all american funds insurance series portfolios american funds portfolios as monitored portfolios we employ various means to monitor transfer activity such as examining the frequency and size of transfers into and out of the monitored funds within given periods of time for example we currently monitor transfer activity to determine if for each of the monitored funds in a threemonth period there were two or more roundtrips of a certain dollar amount or greater a roundtrip is defined as a transfer in followed by a transfer out within the next  calendar days or a transfer out followed by a transfer in within the next  calendar days in the case of a policy that has been restricted previously a single roundtrip of a certain dollar amount or greater will trigger the transfer restrictions described below we do not believe that other funds present a significant opportunity to engage in arbitrage trading and therefore do not monitor transfer activity in those funds we may change the monitored funds at any time without notice in our sole discretion in addition to monitoring transfer activity in certain funds we rely on the underlying funds to bring any potential disruptive trading activity they identify to our attention for investigation on a casebycase basis we will also investigate other harmful transfer activity that we identify from time to time we may revise these policies and procedures in our sole discretion at any time without prior notice american funds monitoring policy as a condition to making their portfolios available in our products american funds requires us to treat all american funds insurance series portfolios american funds portfolios as monitored portfolios under our current market timing and excessive trading policies and procedures further american funds requires us to impose additional specified monitoring criteria for all american funds portfolios available under the policy regardless of the potential for arbitrage trading we are required to monitor transfer activity in american funds portfolios to determine if there were two or more transfers in followed by transfers out in each case of a certain dollar amount or greater in any day period a first violation of the american funds monitoring policy will result in a written notice of violation any additional violation will result in the imposition of the transfer restrictions described below also as monitored portfolios our current market timing and excessive trading policies and procedures also will apply to american funds portfolios and transfer

future our policies and procedures may result in transfer restrictions being applied to deter market timing currently when we detect transfer activity in the monitored funds that exceeds our current transfer limits or other transfer activity that we believe may be harmful to other policy owners or other persons who have an interest in the policies we will exercise our contractual right to revise suspend or eliminate transfer privileges including limiting the acceptable mode of requesting transfers and thereafter will only accept transfer requests via regular us mail and will reject transfer requests requested via facsimile telephone or internet in addition we also reserve the right but do not have the obligation to further restrict the right to request transfers by any market timing firm or any other third party who has been authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple policy owners we may among other things  reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one policy owner or  reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual owners who have executed preauthorized transfer forms which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one policy owner transfers made under a dollar cost averaging program a rebalancing program or if applicable any asset allocation program described in this prospectus are not treated as a transfer when we evaluate trading patterns for market timing or excessive trading the detection and deterrence of harmful transfer activity involves judgments that are inherently subjective such as the decision to monitor only those funds that we believe are susceptible to arbitrage trading or the determination of the transfer limits our ability to detect andor restrict such transfer activity may be limited by operational and technological systems as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by policy owners to avoid such detection our ability to restrict such transfer activity also may be limited by provisions of the policy accordingly there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer activity that may adversely affect policy owners and other persons with interests in the policies we do not accommodate market timing in any fund and there are no arrangements in place to permit any policy owner to engage in market timing we apply our policies and procedures without exception waiver or special arrangement the funds may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares and we reserve the right to enforce these policies and procedures for example funds may assess a redemption fee which we reserve the right to collect on shares held for a relatively short period the prospectuses for the funds describe any such policies and procedures which may be more or less restrictive than the policies and procedures we have adopted although we may not have the contractual authority or the operational capacity to apply the frequent trading policies and procedures of the funds we have entered into a written agreement as required by sec regulation with each fund or its principal underwriter that obligates us to provide to the fund promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of individual policy owners and to execute instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific owners who violate the frequent trading policies established by the fund in addition policy owners and other persons with interests in the policies should be aware that the purchase and redemption orders received by the funds generally are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans or separate accounts funding variable insurance products the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of variable insurance products andor individual retirement plan participants the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the funds in their ability to apply their frequent trading policies and procedures in addition the other insurance companies andor retirement plans may have different policies and procedures or may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual limitations for these reasons we cannot guarantee that the funds and thus policy owners will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to other insurance companies andor retirement plans that may invest in the funds if a fund believes that an omnibus order reflects one or more transfer requests from policy owners engaged in disruptive trading activity the fund may reject the entire omnibus order in accordance with applicable law we reserve the right to modify or terminate the transfer privilege at any time we also reserve the right to defer or restrict the transfer privilege at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares as a result of any of the funds including any refusal or restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th as a result of

retail mutual fund is likely to be different from that of the fund we select the funds offered through this policy based on several criteria including asset class coverage the strength of the advisers

we receive from our affiliated investment advisers are a component of the total revenue that we consider in configuring the features and investment choices available in the variable insurance products that we and our affiliated insurance companies issue since we and our affiliated insurance companies may benefit more from the allocation of assets to portfolios advised by our affiliates than those

on the next business day market timingexcessive trading the policy is intended for use as a longterm investment vehicle and is not designed to serve as a vehicle for excessive trading or market timing in an attempt to take advantage of shortterm fluctuations in the stock market frequent requests from policy owners to transfer cash value may dilute the value of a funds shares if the frequent trading involves an attempt to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies created by a lag between a change in the value of the securities held by the fund and the reflection of that change in the funds share price arbitrage trading regardless of the existence of pricing inefficiencies frequent transfers may also increase brokerage and administrative costs of the underlying funds and may disrupt fund management strategy requiring a fund to maintain a high cash position and possibly resulting in lost investment opportunities and forced liquidations disruptive trading accordingly arbitrage trading and disruptive trading activities referred to collectively as market timing may adversely affect the longterm performance of the funds which in turn adversely affect policy owners and other persons who may have an interest in the policies eg beneficiaries we have policies and procedures that attempt to detect and deter frequent transfers in situations where we determine there is a potential for

intend to treat all american funds insurance series portfolios american funds portfolios as monitored portfolios we employ various means to monitor transfer activity such as examining the frequency and size of transfers into and out of the monitored funds within given periods of time for example we currently monitor transfer activity to determine if for each of the monitored funds in a threemonth period there were two or more roundtrips of a certain dollar amount or greater a roundtrip is defined as a transfer in followed by a transfer out within the next  calendar days or a transfer out followed by a transfer in within the next  calendar days in the case of a policy that has been restricted previously a single roundtrip of a certain dollar amount or greater will trigger the transfer restrictions described below we do not believe that other funds present a significant opportunity to engage in arbitrage trading and therefore do not monitor transfer activity in those funds we may change the monitored funds at any time without notice in our sole discretion in addition to monitoring transfer activity in certain funds we rely on the underlying funds to bring any potential disruptive trading activity they identify to our attention for investigation on a casebycase basis we will also investigate other harmful transfer activity that we identify from time to time we may revise these policies and procedures in our sole discretion at any time without prior notice american funds monitoring policy as a condition to making their portfolios available in our products american funds requires us to treat all american funds insurance series portfolios american funds portfolios as monitored portfolios under our current market timing and excessive trading policies and

trading we are required to monitor transfer activity in american funds portfolios to determine if there were two or more transfers in followed by transfers out in each case of a certain dollar amount or greater in any day period a first violation of the american funds monitoring policy will result in a written notice of violation any additional violation will result in the imposition of the transfer restrictions described below also as monitored portfolios our current market timing and excessive trading policies and procedures also will apply to american funds portfolios and transfer

future our policies and procedures may result in transfer restrictions being applied to deter market timing currently when we detect transfer activity in the monitored funds that exceeds our current transfer limits or other transfer activity that we believe may be harmful to other policy owners or other persons who have an interest in the policies we will exercise our contractual right to revise suspend or eliminate transfer privileges including limiting the acceptable mode of requesting transfers and thereafter will only accept transfer requests via regular us mail and will reject transfer requests requested via facsimile telephone or internet in addition we also reserve the right but do not have the obligation to further restrict the right to request transfers by any market timing firm or any other third party who has been authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple policy owners we may among other things  reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one policy owner or  reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual owners who have executed preauthorized transfer forms which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one policy owner transfers made under a dollar cost averaging program a rebalancing program or if applicable any asset allocation program described in this prospectus are not treated as a transfer when we evaluate trading patterns for market timing or excessive trading the detection and deterrence of harmful transfer activity involves judgments that are inherently subjective such as the decision to monitor only those funds that we believe are susceptible to arbitrage trading or the determination of the transfer limits our ability to detect andor restrict such transfer activity may be limited by operational and technological systems as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by policy owners to avoid such detection our ability to restrict such transfer activity also may be limited by provisions of the policy accordingly there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer activity that may adversely affect policy owners and other persons with interests in the policies we do not accommodate market timing in any fund and there are no arrangements in place to permit any policy owner to engage in market timing we apply our policies and procedures without exception waiver or special arrangement the funds may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares and we reserve the right to enforce these policies and procedures for example funds may assess a redemption fee which we reserve the right to collect on shares held for a relatively short period the prospectuses for the funds describe any such policies and procedures which may be more or less restrictive than the policies and procedures we have adopted although we may not have the contractual authority or the operational capacity to apply the frequent trading policies and procedures of the funds we have entered into a written agreement as required by sec regulation with each fund or its principal underwriter that obligates us to provide to the fund promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of individual policy owners and to execute instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific owners who violate the frequent trading policies established by the fund in addition policy owners and other persons with interests in the policies should be aware that the purchase and redemption orders received by the funds generally are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans or separate accounts funding variable insurance products the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of variable insurance products andor individual retirement plan participants the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the funds in their ability to apply their frequent trading policies and procedures in addition the other insurance companies andor retirement plans may have different policies and procedures or may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual limitations for these reasons we cannot guarantee that the funds and thus policy owners will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to other insurance companies andor retirement plans that may invest in the funds if a fund believes that an omnibus order reflects one or more transfer requests from policy owners engaged in disruptive trading activity the fund may reject the entire omnibus order in accordance with applicable law we reserve the right to modify or terminate the transfer privilege at any time we also reserve the right to defer or restrict the transfer privilege at any time that we are unable to

analysis and conditions  the substitution applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions  applicants represent that the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts of its intention to take the necessary actions including seeking the order requested by this application to substitute shares of the funds as described herein the supplement has advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge the start printed page supplement also has informed contract owners that the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the supplement has also advised contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund all inkind redemptions from an existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december    contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or an insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all contract value or cash value under a contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to “market timing” activity the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will also send each contract owner current prospectuses for the replacement funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received a copy  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate  the substitution applicants agree that for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions those contract owners whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and

portfolio substitutions the agreement not to increase the separate account charges will extend for the life of each contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions  in each case the applicable insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the insurance companies believe that in cases where the replacement fund has a new subadviser the new subadviser will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing funds subadviser  the substitution applicants anticipate that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions  the substitution applicants submit that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent  the substitution applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions by the insurance companies  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement funds investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  the insurance companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of the following existing funds janus aspen global technology portfolio legg mason clearbridge variable capital portfolio legg mason global currents variable international all cap opportunity portfolio legg mason western asset variable diversified strategic income portfolio legg mason western asset variable strategic bond portfolio pioneer bond vct portfolio and pioneer fund vct portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those funds  because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing funds to the insurance companies immediately thereafter the insurance companies would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the existing funds accordingly as the insurance companies and certain of the existing funds listed above and the insurance companies and the replacement funds could be viewed as affiliated persons of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement funds by the insurance companies including the consideration to be paid and received as described in this application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the insurance companies are consistent with the policies of a mist and of its third avenue small cap value rcm technology mettempleton growth mfs research international pimco total return and pioneer fund portfolios and b met series fund and of its davis venture value western asset management strategic bond opportunities and van eck global natural resources portfolios start printed page as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the act  to the extent that the inkind purchases by the insurance company of the replacement funds shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among affiliated persons the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts the insurance companies mist and met series fund may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons in addition as stated above the inkind redemptions will only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the signature financial group noaction letter december    the boards of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and each series procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in kind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed insurance company inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the investment companies and the replacement funds because a the shares are sold at their net asset value and b the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met metlife advisers llc and the subadviser as applicable will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants submit that the proposed insurance company inkind purchases are consistent with the general purposes of the act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the act and that the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the act was designed to prevent  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the act exempting the separate accounts the insurance companies mist met series fund and each replacement fund from the provisions of section a of the act to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies on behalf of the separate accounts to carry out as part of the substitutions the inkind purchase of shares of the replacement funds which may be deemed to be prohibited by section a of the act conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the

investment adviser of each of the replacement funds  the substitution applicants believe the substitutions will provide significant benefits to contract owners including improved selection of subadvisers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings  based on generally better performance records and lower total expenses of the replacement funds the substitution applicants believe that the subadvisers to the replacement funds overall may provide more consistent performance for their funds than the advisers or subadvisers of the existing funds other than those advisers or subadvisers that manage both the existing fund and the replacement fund at the same time applicants assert that contract owners will continue to be able to select among a similar number of investment options with a similar range of investment objectives investment strategies and managers  as a result of the substitutions the number of investment options offered under the contracts may change slightly that number which currently ranges from three to  will range from three to  following the substitutions for the contracts that will experience a reduction in the number of available investment options the applicants assert that none will be reduced by more than two investment options and all will have at least  available investment options after the

comstock portfolio substitution the total expenses before waivers and net expenses after waivers of invesco comstock portfolio were lower than those of invesco vi growth and income fund  the applicants assert the substitutions will result in decreased net expense ratios after waivers ranging from  to  moreover there will be no increase in contract fees and expenses including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the separate accounts as a result of the substitutions the substitution applicants believe that the replacement funds have investment objectives policies and risk profiles as described in their prospectuses that are substantially the same as or sufficiently similar to the corresponding existing funds to make those replacement funds appropriate candidates as substitutes the insurance companies considered the performance history of start printed page the existing funds and the replacement funds and determined that no contract owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the substitutions  the share classes of the replacement funds are either identical to or less than the share classes of the existing funds with respect to the imposition of rule b fees currently imposed except with respect to the substitution of clearbridge variable all cap value portfoliot rowe price large cap value

companies or their affiliates any rule b fees associated with the class of shares sold to the separate accounts similarly the distributors for mist and met series fund will receive from the applicable class of shares held by the separate accounts rule b fees in the same amount or a lesser amount than the amount paid by the existing funds except as described above legal analysis and conditions  the substitution applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions  applicants represent that the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the registered contracts and separate accounts and private placement memoranda for the unregistered contracts and separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts affected by the substitutions of its intention to take the necessary actions to substitute shares of the funds as described in this notice the supplement has advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge the supplement also has informed contract owners that the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the supplement also has advised contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or an insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all contract value or cash value under a contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the written notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to “market timing” activity the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions are completed the insurance companies will also send each contract owner current prospectuses for the replacement funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received copies  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriatestart printed page   the substitution applicants agree that for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions those contract owners whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the existing funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses for fiscal year  except with respect to the clearbridge variable all cap

extend for the life of each contract outstanding on the date the proposed substitutions are completed  in each case the applicable insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the insurance companies believe that the replacement funds subadviser where applicable will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing funds subadviser  the substitution applicants assert that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions  the substitution applicants represent that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract or cash values into other subaccounts moreover the insurance companies will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts into any of the remaining subaccounts without cost or other disadvantage the proposed substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption which section c was designed to prevent section b relief  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of the shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement funds investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies the insurance companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of the following existing funds invesco vi american

pioneer emerging markets vct portfolio pioneer equity income vct portfolio pioneer ibbotson growth allocation vct portfolio pioneer ibbotson moderate allocation vct portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those funds all inkind redemptions from an start printed page existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december    the section  applicants submit that the inkind transactions as described in the application meet the conditions set forth in section b of the  act  section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash enumerated in rule a of the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts the applicants assert that contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions and the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions  the boards of trustees of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants assert they will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and each series procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the substitution applicants state that the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed inkind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed insurance company inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the investment companies and the replacement funds because  the shares are sold at their net asset value and  the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met metlife advisers llc and the subadviser as applicable will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind purchases meet all of the requirements of section b of the act and that an exemption should be granted to the extent necessary from the provisions of section a conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the act and are consistent with the standards of section b of the act and that the requested orders should be granted start signature for the commission by the

except as described above legal analysis and conditions  the substitution applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions  applicants represent that the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the registered contracts and separate accounts and private placement memoranda for the unregistered contracts and separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts affected by the substitutions of its intention to take the necessary actions to substitute shares of the funds as described in this notice the supplement has advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge the supplement also has informed contract owners that the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the supplement also has advised contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or an insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all contract value or cash value under a contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the written notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to market timing activity the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions are completed the insurance companies will also send each contract owner current prospectuses for the replacement funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received copies  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate page   the substitution applicants agree that for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions those contract owners whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the existing funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses for fiscal year  except

not to increase the separate account charges will extend for the life of each contract outstanding on the date the proposed substitutions are completed  in each case the applicable insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the insurance companies believe that the replacement funds subadviser where applicable will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing funds subadviser  the substitution applicants assert that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions  the substitution applicants represent that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract or cash values into other subaccounts moreover the insurance companies will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts into any of the remaining subaccounts without cost or other disadvantage the proposed substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption which section c was designed to prevent section b relief  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of the shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement funds investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies the insurance companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of the following existing funds invesco vi american value fund invesco vi global real estate fund invesco vi growth and income fund clearbridge variable all cap value portfolio uif us real estate portfolio pioneer

will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december    the section  applicants submit that the inkind transactions as described in the application meet the conditions set forth in section b of the  act  section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash enumerated in rule a of the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts the applicants assert that contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions and the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions  the boards of trustees of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants assert they will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and each series procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the substitution applicants state that the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed inkind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed insurance company inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the investment companies and the replacement funds because  the shares are sold at their net asset value and  the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met metlife advisers llc and the subadviser as applicable will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind purchases meet all of the requirements of section b of the act and that an exemption should be granted to the extent necessary from the provisions of section a conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the act and are consistent with the standards of section b of the act and that the requested orders should be granted for the commission by the division

cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund all inkind redemptions from an existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated

available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the

substitutions by the insurance companies  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting verdate mar  jan   jkt  them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement fund’s investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  the insurance companies through

persons the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing funds to the insurance companies immediately thereafter the insurance companies would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the existing funds accordingly as the insurance companies and certain of the existing funds listed above and the insurance companies and the replacement funds could be viewed as affiliated persons of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and c the proposed

to the extent that the inkind purchases by the insurance company of the replacement funds’ shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among affiliated persons the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a– the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c–  thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owner’s contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts the insurance companies mist and met series fund may not rely on rule a–  the section  applicants believe that the rule’s conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons in addition as stated above the inkind redemptions will only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the signature financial group noaction letter december    the boards of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a– pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a– and each series’ procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the verdate mar  jan   jkt  proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a– provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a– and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c– under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in kind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed insurance company inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the investment companies and the replacement funds because a the shares are sold at their net asset value and b the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met metlife advisers llc and the subadviser as applicable will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants submit that the proposed insurance company inkind purchases are consistent with the general purposes of the act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the act and that the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the act was designed to prevent  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the act exempting the separate accounts the insurance companies mist met series

section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions  applicants represent that the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts of its intention to take the necessary actions including seeking the order requested by this application to substitute shares of the funds as described herein the supplement has advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund sub account to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer

at least  days after the proposed substitutions the supplement has also advised contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund all inkind redemptions from an existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december    contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or an insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all contract value or cash value under a contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to market timing activity the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will also send each contract owner current prospectuses for the replacement funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received a copy  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate  the substitution applicants agree that for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions those contract owners whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds net operating expenses taking into

substitutions  in each case the applicable insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the insurance companies believe that in cases where the replacement fund has a new subadviser the new subadviser will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing funds subadviser  the substitution applicants anticipate that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of sub accounts offered prior to the substitutions  the substitution applicants submit that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent  the substitution applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions by the insurance companies  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement funds investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  the insurance companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of the following existing funds janus aspen global technology portfolio legg mason clearbridge variable capital portfolio legg mason global currents variable international all cap opportunity portfolio legg mason western asset variable diversified strategic income portfolio legg mason western asset variable strategic bond portfolio pioneer bond vct portfolio and pioneer fund vct portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those funds  because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing funds to the insurance companies immediately thereafter the insurance companies would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the existing funds accordingly as the insurance companies and certain of the existing funds listed above and the insurance companies and the replacement funds could be viewed as affiliated persons of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement funds by the insurance companies including the consideration to be paid and received as described in this application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the insurance companies are consistent with the policies of a mist and of its third avenue small cap value rcm technology mettempleton growth mfs research international pimco total return and pioneer fund portfolios and b met series fund and of its davis venture value western asset management strategic bond opportunities and van eck global natural resources portfolios page  as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the act  to the extent that the inkind purchases by the insurance company of the replacement funds shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among affiliated persons the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts the insurance companies mist and met series fund may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons in addition as stated above the inkind redemptions will only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the signature financial group noaction letter december    the boards of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and each series procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in kind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed insurance company inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the investment companies and the replacement funds because a the shares are sold at their net asset value and b the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met metlife advisers llc and the subadviser as applicable will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants submit that the proposed insurance company inkind purchases are consistent with the general purposes of the act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the act and that the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the act was designed to prevent  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the act exempting the separate accounts the insurance companies mist met series fund and each replacement fund from the provisions of section a of the act to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies on behalf of the separate accounts to carry out as part of the substitutions the in kind purchase of shares of the replacement funds which may be deemed to be prohibited by section a of the act conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the act and are consistent with the standards of section b of the act and that the requested orders should be granted for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated
