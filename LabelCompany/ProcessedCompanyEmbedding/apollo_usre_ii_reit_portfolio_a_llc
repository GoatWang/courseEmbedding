advisors we are pleased to have reached a definitive agreement with ari that we believe serves the best interests of our stockholders this transaction offers amtg stockholders an opportunity to receive a significant premium to the recent and current trading value of the common stock and importantly an opportunity to participate in ari’s future growth through ownership of ari common stock we believe the transaction will provide an excellent outcome for amtg stockholders and is the alternative that will offer the most attractive value” jeffrey m gault chairman of the board of directors of ari and chairman of ari’s special committee of the board of directors said “ari’s accretive acquisition of amtg will enable both companies’ stockholders to participate in ari’s future growth as we

december   ari’s investment portfolio totaled approximately  billion and the company’s market capitalization totaled approximately  billion benefits to ari stockholders ability to expand the balance
