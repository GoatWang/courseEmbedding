so cute who wouldn’t want to spend a cold saturday in january looking for one of these you never know what a michigan january will bring last year hrwc was forced to cancel the stonefly search because of subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions  but this year on january   intrepid volunteers enjoyed bright sunshine and  degree weather as they spread across the huron river watershed they were in search of stoneflies which are only found in clean and healthy streams  everyone made it back safe and not a single leaky wader was reported overall it was a great success the results are in and are given in this pdf report what we found  usually when we look at the data after an aquatic bug search we see that some sites do better than normal some sites do worse but most sites stay the same this was a strange year because while most sites stayed the same several did worse than normal and none did better  overall the count of stonefly families was down about  from our last sampling event  there is no clear explanation for this weather conditions were great and the ice wasn’t any thicker than other year  we will start to be concerned if we continue to see this happen year after year however there is always natural variation in the data and collecting and this year will likely not be the start of a downward trend in terms of the overall sampling   caroline hrwc intern and volunteer scours malletts creek in hopes of scoring a capnid  that being said there are specific locations that have shown longterm degradation for example honey creek in ann arbor the team searching for stoneflies in honey creek at wagner were unable to find stoneflies this site has been sampled  times since  and this is the first time that stoneflies could not be found this is a site with lots of turbulent highly oxygenated water and should be a great place for stoneflies taken in isolation the absence of the stoneflies at wagner road would not be concerning given that this is a single sample  however two upstream honey creek adoptastream sites used to have stoneflies but haven’t in years  stoneflies haven’t been seen in honey creek at jackson road since  they haven’t been at honey creek at pratt road since  all of the pieces combined indicates that the overall quality of honey creek is degrading over the last decade  davis creek at pontiac trail is another location where the stonefly population has dropped over time this change is concerning because it happened slowly over the last ten years and our spring and fall samples show a very similar pattern  in the early s we regularly found one or two stonefly families at the creek but they started to drop off and now have not been found since   all this doom and gloom needs to be put in perspective though remember most of the sites we visited were as healthy as ever  of the  adoptastream sites that hrwc uses to assess the overall water quality of the watershed stoneflies are regularly found at  of them in other words  of our watershed has very high water quality and habitat this agrees with recent analyses of other hrwc data showing that  of the watershed was good to very high quality  was fair to good and  was highly impacted  state of the huron next on the horizon interested in doing more with our macroinvertebrate searches  think about becoming a trained leader or collector by coming to the next training on march   this is an extremely important job because every team needs both a trained leader and collector and we often do not have enough to meet the demand  sign up for the training   the

september th   author pam labadie is fall the best time to plant trees good question seems that the answer is debatable with the onset of fall there are a couple of compelling reasons to plant — availability and affordability we know of at least two upcoming tree sales here in the shed washtenaw county conservation district fall tree sale order by september  matthaei botanical gardens fall native plant and tree sale october october  ampm what is not up for debate is that trees are good for protecting local waterways “polluted stormwater runoff is the number one threat to the huron’s health trees soak up stormwater with their roots and intercept rainwater in their canopies they filter pollution such as pesticides fertilizers and animal wastes out of runoff and they shade the river and its streams keeping them cool one tree can intercept  gallons of runoff water each year” huron river report fall  hardworking trees lowcost watershed workers need more proof check out trees tame

comments closed working for the huron at home march th   author laura rubin in addition to being the director at hrwc i own a home as a homeowner we’ve been trying to reduce our carbon footprint and save water and energy my work in the environmental field makes me familiar with the many things we can do at home to protect the environment but it takes money and time to act on these tips this past year we were finally able to work on a few “greening” home improvements shared here for inspiration    rain gardens last year we reached out to the washtenaw county water resource commissioner’s office to help develop a plan to capture and infiltrate more of the runoff from our roof  years ago we installed a rain barrel but it is limited to  gallons per rain with use in between rains  i live in ann arbor on a pretty small parcel and there is not much room for rain storage and infiltration…or a garden  but we were able to identify  different rain garden locations—one a swale along one side of the house and another in the front of the house after choosing plants and a design we installed the rain garden last spring—digging mulching and placing rocks and native plants strategically for rain water capture and aesthetics at first it didn’t look like much but as the summer and fall wore on the plants blossomed and grew  we enjoyed running outside when it was raining to see the water gushing out of the gutterdownspout and in to the rain garden where it soaked in to the ground  we found out that we have pretty sandy soils unusual for this area so the water soaked in quickly  if anything we can divert more runoff to this garden it was so “thirsty”  i also learned through trial and error what was a weed and what wasn’t  staying on top of the weeding is the biggest challenge now that the rain garden is in solar panels last summer we also decided to install solar panels  since we had last looked in to solar panels the cost has come down substantially  there are also substantial tax incentives in place this year that help with the price of the panels we got quotes talked with colleagues and friends who had installed panels and chose an installer homeland  it took over  months until the system was up and running but in early november we were generating electricity  we’re still getting familiar with how it all works but we have a nice looking box in the basement that hums when we are generating energy and a website to track our power generation  we’re looking forward to the summer when the sun really shines to see how much energy we can generate and reduce our carbon for you if you are considering home improvements or even smaller actions that help protect the environment hrwc promotes many of them at our take action pages our booth at the home garden
