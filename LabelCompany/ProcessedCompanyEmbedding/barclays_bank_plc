deutsche bank plc print reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia published rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers barclays bank plc  deutsche bank plc introduction the historical models of market opportunities have favored coordinated market economies cme’s over liberal market economies lme’s however this traditional position has shifted in the case of europe where the central eastern european countries have demonstrated a growth rate in loans of twelve percent  as compared to just four percent  over the mature markets of western europe during the past three  years hoover’s  germany’s deutsche bank operates in a coordinated market economy and experienced an increase of forty six percent  in revenues before income tax expense over  this is in marked contrast with the results recorded in  when the bank experienced a decline of almost twenty percent  in revenues the united kingdom’s barclays plc which operates in a liberal market economy has recorded an increase in profit of twenty percent  in  over  and a rise in income of twelve percent  barclays plc  this essay will seek to examine the differences in performance of these two banks based upon the comparative institutional advantages inherent in operating in a coordinated market economy versus a liberal market economy focusing on changes or other developments at these institutions regarding performance and changes or strategies implemented to effect improvements to reflect the results recorded in  the preceding will take into account recent changes in cme and lme systems and their effects as contributors to the foregoing the radically differing context that represent these two market systems are each selfsustaining and in their individual frameworks as well as being selfreinforcing espinganderrsen  the inherent structure of these two market economic systems form the environment in which the subject banks operate and as a result influence their performance thus causing them to implement and introduce strategies to override or negate to some degree the inherent inhibiting factors and or forces at work casper et al  explained the production system in germany as ‘diversified quality production’ dqp which relies upon the consistent improvement in products through either better production processes or specialized employees as well as distribution the preceding sets up a system of high production quality as a definitive aspect of the cme system the basis of the lme system relies upon the consistency of innovation to drive product generation rather than the improvement based foundation of the coordinated market economy system the inherent capability of the lme system that allows for capital to be raised quickly as well as to hire as well as fire workers when new projects fail the foregoing process represents a strength in the lme system as it has proved extremely successful in the software and biotechnology sectors however it has its drawbacks in machine tools and other longer standing skilled industries the proceeding peek into lme and cme systems offers a generalized overview that represents the underlying basis for the examination of barclays plc and deutsche bank plc with respect to changes or other developments at these institutions regarding performance and changes or strategies implemented to effect improvements to reflect recent results lme  cme                                                                                               in order to understand the context that helps to formulate the strategic performance changes at barclays plc and deutsche bank plc as well as the rationales involved one must have an understanding of the market economy context they are in the coordinated market economy of germany has been undergoing a slow transformation that has focused upon further specialization in those fields that it has a comparative advantage casper et al  the governmental and business policy as a result of globalization has resulted in german companies divesting themselves of less competitive industry sectors to focus upon those representing an advantage iversen  the foregoing represents an important change in the dynamics of the coordinated market economy system where a considerable investment is made in increasing the skills of workers who produce products requiring high technological skills and knowhow to accomplish the preceding the training in labor requires considerable assurances that this investment will be retained rather than reentered into the workforce as is the case in the liberal market model hall et al  employers unions help to stabilize the preceding by ensuring that competitive companies do not wrest trained employees through having unions with a seat in the running of the company as this represents their best interests the foregoing results in a longterm stabilization factor that provides the foundation for capital to be obtained with the long term view in mind the foregoing has particular importance in the case of deutsche bank as in the cme model banks have access to distinct information on companies as a result of their providing the availability of long term capital which means that the bank obtains a seat on the company’s board the foregoing enables the institution to have first hand knowledge on the actions of the company in liberal market economies the coordination with respect to the varied components of the capitalist model is by and large market based in this instance employers do not have any guarantee with respect to workers remaining loyal as the main incentive of wages enables other firms to successfully bid for the services of skilled employees in the instance of worker unions there are no provisions against rival firms hiring away employees this condition limits the amount of training that employers can and do invest in worker skills as there is no guarantee that they employees will remain loyal dore  the preceding means that workers do not benefit from advanced training thus creating the condition whereby most positions require relatively simple skills which in most instances are learned on the job under the circumstance of the foregoing fast changing employee environment long term as well as short term capital is difficult to secure this therefore brings equity financing to the forefront as the principle means the equity finance rate in the united kingdom as well as the united states exceeds one hundred percent  of their respective gross domestic product this is in sharp contrast to germany where that figure is less than forty percent  with the shareholder incentive based upon profits rather than long term market positioning through superior products management is prone to reduce the labor force to produce bottom line results thus increasing unemployment this condition fosters invention rather than product improvement sacrificing long term quality for short term bottom line results the effects of globalization as well as the introduction of a single market currency in the european union are impacting upon both the lme model in the united kingdom as well as the cme model in germany as a result of financial disintermediation alvarez et al  the foregoing sets up the condition whereby equity might be available at rates that are less expensive than that which is offered by banking institutions this condition has particular relevance in germany whereby it could provide a wedge between firms and banks thus eroding the existing longterm arrangement and seats of banks on corporate boards the preceding will undo the underlying labor relations arrangement and thus a convergence with regard to the cme market model calmfors et al  the introduction of the euro could very well indicate a change for germany as a result of real wages are impacted by the agreement of unions with the german central bank the aforementioned condition has already been manifested in varied degrees in sweden italy and france cme countries that have been converging on the lme model creating hybrid systems with characteristics of both as well as specific aspects of their own individual country applications maurice et al  this has increased competition in with varied british companies in low skilled industries thus bringing increased competitiveness as the dynamics acting upon these two models increases as a result of globalization cross border currency and competitive circumstances various cme based models will increasingly acquire characteristics of the lme model the foregoing also is influenced by the posturing of political parties seeking election by either reintroducing cme model framework supports or elements of the lme model the preceding has implications for both barclays plc and deutsche bank plc in their approach to performance strategies barclays plc barclays’ origins can be found back in  to john freame and thomas gould the named changed to its present form when james barclay became a partner in   presently barclays is the third largest bank in the united kingdom the institution’s primary focus is in retail banking investment banking as well as investment management barclays operates in  countries and operates over  offices in the united kingdom and is one of the ten largest banks global when measured by market capitalization barclays plc  the institution’s core business revolves around retail and investment banking and it is the later that is being impacted by forces acting upon liberal market economies in varied european union member states as a result of the aforementioned introduction of the euro as well as globalization as a result of the preceding barclays services the united kingdom market as well as providing services to multinational companies located in differing market models a swot analysis of barclays reveals the following barclays plc  strengthsweaknessesbarclays is one of the uk’s largest financial companiesreduction in the banks branchesglobal diversity in  countriesweak private clients performanceexcellent acquisition strategy that has expanded barclays distribution baseopportunitiesthreatsexpansion in wealth management and private bankinglack of crossselling initiatives in wealth managementoffering life pension and varied investment products to customer base increased uk competition from clearing and mortgage banks the proliferation of banking consolidation within the industry is and has created a new era of international banking conglomerates particularly in the united states the preceding is causing european based banks to appear small in terms of relative comparison barclays’ operation in a liberal market economy means it competes with equity financing for corporations and as such this does not represent a strength concerning its overall performance base the swot analysis identifies that barclays’ performance underpinnings are represented by its strategy of acquiring other banking concerns to expand its retail as well as other banking services through representation in international markets as represented by the bank’s presence in  countries this provides barclays with the means to sell its highly profitable investment banking services as well as be positioned to service the cadre of multinational companies that utilize its diverse banking financial service packages barclays is known a consistent performer delivering steady profitability results  increase in profit before taxes in  and again in  and one of the lowest cost to income ratios with regard to banks in the uk the preceding indicates that barclays is well managed barclays’ focus on internal administrative consolidation as well as the acquisition of banking concerns represents its recognition of forces within the lms model that it must respond to in order to maintain growth in revenues return on equity dividends and profits in response to maintaining a high market capitalization that tends to make it a relatively unattractive takeover target as a result of the high premium required to acquire it barclays’ retail banking arm is clearly supported by the huge success of its barclaycard division that has set industry standards in terms of innovations in customer utility barclays’ presence in  countries further strengthens the utility of this card providing business and retail customers with access to their financial accounts globally barclays plc  the aforementioned diversity in operations is a result of the economic strength of liberal market based economies that have fully recovered from the global recession events of  barclays’ banking acquisition strategy is a direct outgrowth of the foregoing in keeping with the consolidation mania initiated by us based banks that also operate under the lme model deutsche bank plc deutsche bank was granted a license to operate as a financial institution by the prussian government in  with a view to challenging the supremacy of british banks that were dominating german foreign trade as one of the four largest banks in germany deutsche bank is strongly positioned within europe and offers corporate as well as investment banking as its principle core business as well as the management of private client accounts asset management services and products located in over  countries deutsche bank  deutsche has a strong global presence yet it has a high reliance on its domestic market that represents a cme model the cost to income ratio for deutsche is above the german average of  and this indicates that the institution is not being managed efficiently its return on equity is in line with the german average but is one of the worst performing areas in its financial analysis the swot analysis of deutsche points out specifics that indicate operating problems deutsche bank  strengthsweaknessesfinancial strength in the face of multiple problems as its resources are higher than competitorsexposure to fluctuations in the

positive growth regionweak economy in germany the aforementioned consolidation practices have increased competition and has affected  german banks along with the introduction of the euro which has increased the cross market capabilities of banks as a result of the elimination of currency transfer rates which had insulated the german cme model banks from lme markets the global market diversification of deutsche has protected it somewhat against the poor economic performance in its home market deutsche has recognized that its internal operations have further exacerbated its poor performance and set about an internal restructuring and reorganization in  to address performance hopner et al  termed a “transformation” program management implemented this process in response to subpar performance in  and this has resulted in an increase in income before taxes in  of fortysix percent  over year end results in  deutsche bank  additional results were also achieved in the bank’s risk management profile that reduced problem loans by twentyseven percent  over  deutsche bank   the aforementioned internal program also produced results in deutsche’s corporate and investment banking units as well as asset management arm along with corporate division private  business client units the aforementioned ‘transformation’ program focused on identification of the internal bank operational and administrative factors contributing to poor performance as well as reorganizing operations to centralize functions and reporting procedures deutsche also implemented extensive cost cutting measures with all efforts focusing on a reduction in operating expenditures and revenues growth through aggressive new business generation the bank’s investment banking business which has long been one of its core strengths was emphasized and experienced healthy growth as a result of refocusing however a strong euro impacted negatively on bottom line performance the preceding developments represent effects of a cme based model that was impacted negatively by the performance in lme based economies conclusion the economic events that preceded as well as followed  caused lme based companies and governments to examine means via which to reenergize their economies this resulted in reducing expenditures on social areas as well as lowering interest rates to refuel borrowing for expansion and growth companies within these markets lme conducted a string of ‘down sizing’ measures which increased unemployment but made companies financially stronger and helped to fuel a massive number of mega mergers that were based upon models of economy of scale as well as generating bottom line performance as dictated by shareholder concerns for growth governmental intervention in terms of interest rate cuts and other market stimulation measures aided in creating competitive advantages that came at the expense of cme based models and had the effect of severely impacting growth in that sector globalization had less of a negative affect on lme based models as the primary market country the united states generated growth through utilization of the ‘golden straitjacket’ principle friedman  explains the foregoing as the adoption of deregulation and reforms aimed at increasing the competitiveness of a country’s home based businesses and industries one such area resulted in the mega merger mania in the united states that impacted various industries as well as the round of banking consolidations the ability of lme models to make quick short term adjustments as opposed to the slow turn around time required for cme models generated growth in that sector while slowing it in another this proved to affect germany’s economy while aiding that of the united kingdom deutsche bank plc has managed through a refocusing of its efforts to reverse the negative performances generated in  and  with further progress being made as a result of understanding the corrective measures that were and are needed to be taken barclays’ performance throughout this period has remained consistent and steady as the bank has not lost sight of the competencies that helped it achieve acceptable
