religion grantmaking is to deepen and enrich the religious lives of american christians primarily by helping to strengthen their congregations to that end our religion grantmaking in recent years has consisted largely of a series of major interlocking initiatives aimed at enhancing and sustaining the quality of ministry in american congregations and parishes the endowment has focused on supporting programs and projects that address three broad questions how do we identify recruit and call forth a new generation of talented christian pastors how do we best prepare and train new ministers for effective and faithful pastoral leadership how do we improve the skills and sustain the excellence of pastors currently serving congregations we also fund efforts that enhance the vitality of local congregations and that enable ordinary church members to mine the deep wisdom of the christian faith and to take up their vocations in the life of the world as people of faith convictions our efforts are premised on the conviction that the local congregation is the primary place where most christians gather in community to worship god to learn what it means to be people of faith to teach the beliefs and practices of christian faith to each new generation and to reach out to others in service and witness strong vital congregations play powerful roles in the lives of those who participate in them as well as to the larger civic communities of which they are a part several additional convictions also shape the endowments religion funding first we believe that the quality of pastoral leadership is critical to the health and vitality of congregations when wellprepared thoughtful imaginative able and caring pastors lead congregations they tend to thrive second theological schools play a critical role in preparing pastors for their leadership responsibilities in congregations they are uniquely equipped to provide the deep and sustained exploration of the wisdom of the christian tradition and the practical training pastors need in order to lead their congregations and serve their people well third there is a still wider ecology of institutions including colleges and universities publishers and communications media denominational judicatories and independent agencies that support congregations and their pastoral leaders as well as conduct other crucial ministries the endowment seeks both to support them directly and to enable them to work collaboratively to address key challenges facing local congregations and pastoral leaders finally ongoing research and other forms of sustained intellectual inquiry are necessary to help all these institutions and leaders understand and address the fundamental issues facing the church and religious life in our society today initiatives in light of these convictions the endowments religion initiatives have been designed to identify recruit and call forth a new generation of talented christian pastors to enhance the capacities of theological schools to prepare and sustain ministers in effective and faithful pastoral leadership to assist new pastors as they make their transition from theological seminary into the first several years of the actual practice of congregational ministry and to provide opportunities for established pastors to renew and sustain their commitments to and excellence in pastoral ministry over the course of their careers in addition the endowment has launched a relatively new initiative that is supporting regional denominational judicatories serving congregations in indiana to identify and address critical economic challenges faced by their pastors and families most of the endowmens religion grants are made in the context of largescale programmatic initiatives like those described above in launching and sustaining these initiatives the endowment prepares requests for proposals on specific themes or issues that it then sends out to selected institutions that it believes may be wellsuited to mount programs of the kind the endowment seeks to support while most of these programs are currently closed to new grantees two of them  the national clergy renewal program and the clergy renewal program for indiana congregations  are open to applications on an annual basis from congregations that meet each programs selection criteria the clergy renewal programs are administered by christian theological seminary and more information may be obtained from the cts website wwwctsedu or by contacting robert c saler at  in addition to its major initiatives the endowment also

as indispensable to personal civic and economic success it remains alarmed therefore about indianas ranking as one of the lowest states in the nation in the percentage of adults age  and over with a bachelors degree accordingly raising the educational attainment level of indiana citizens has been the overriding objective of the endowments education grantmaking for the last several years in pursuit of this objective the endowment has supported research into the factors underlying this low ranking� although indianas rich agricultural and manufacturing heritage served it well for decades its economy is now in transition and increasingly more affected by global economic forces� more indiana residents and communities must appreciate that higher educational attainment is now essential to foster the quality of life they desire through its education grantmaking the endowment is interested in and supports a variety of programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of educational experiences for indiana residents and help them find meaningful and rewarding employment in the state� its grants benefit a range of students from those in k schools and indiana colleges and universities to adult students in community college settings� it funds efforts to strengthen educational institutions and their educational and research programs enhance the effectiveness and morale of indiana teachers provide resources for students to pay for college educations expand college internship and placement programs�and engage community residents in supporting improvements in the quality of education� for additional information about�specific grants please see the endowments press releases and annual reports under the communications link� the endowment is confident indiana will meet its educational challenges because of the creativity resourcefulness and spirit of its residents� it is heartened by the educational common�ground that is being built through connections

concentrates its philanthropic efforts in community development in its home territory of indianapolis and indiana for the past few years the endowment has focused especially on how its grants promote a virtuous circle of community development��a virtuous circle has been defined as a condition in which a favorable circumstance or result gives rise to another that subsequently supports the first� the american heritage dictionary of the english language fourth edition the dynamics in the business sector have significant effects on whether there is a virtuous circle of community� whether through making cars developing and selling pharmaceuticals managing a huge chain store or a small boutique making art developing new medical devices or information technology applications or building engines  the success of such enterprises is absolutely critical for a lively and growing community successful businesses give rise to a healthy nonprofit sector� caring and concerned citizens are the volunteers and board members of the communitys arts and human service organizations local school corporations and colleges and universities� they are the parishioners of the communitys congregations� their ability to donate funds and share expertise depends on the prosperity of their employers� without profitable vibrant businesses the communitys nonprofit sector would be seriously undermined and a virtuous circle could be diminished in community development the endowment finds appealing programs and initiatives that build or enhance the quality of life in indiana so that vibrant businesses and their employees will want to remain or locate here� in indianapolis the endowment for example believes that its grants to the united way of central indiana indianapolis neighborhood housing partnership and a range of arts and cultural organizations help these organizations foster a more humane and attractive community� its grants for charitable and educational initiatives of the central indiana corporate partnership and the cicp foundation also help create the conditions and intellectual capital that are essential for a prosperous economy and help make the community a place that businesses want to call home around the state of indiana the endowment continues its interest in and support of efforts to build the quality of life and civic vitality of indiana communities� it does this in two principal ways� the first is through its support of indianas impressive array of community foundations� through its giving indiana funds for tomorrow gift initiative which began in  the endowment has supported the development and flourishing of community foundations in every one of indianas  counties� the second is through its support of the indiana association of united ways and its programs to help more than  united ways throughout the state� in the phrase popularized by harvard universitys robert putnam it is social capital that the community foundations and united ways�are building and sustaining the capital that is a vital ingredient of a healthy community community development division links   lilly endowment inc  resources       acrobat pdf viewer software is
