development company that plans to patent license manufacture market and sell new proprietary high valueadded drugs for cancer and other lifethreatening diseases in north america europe and japan as of august of  novellos was seeking capital to fund clinical trials of its first drug which it described as a chemically synthesized biologically active compound    expected to capture a significant share of the    market for immune system modulators    and blood cell disorder drugs the clinical trials it planned at that time involved patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and suffering from neutropenia thrombocytopenia and anemia and patients with myelodysplastic syndromes in particular novelos sought to conduct clinical trials using its technology for treatment of blood disorders known as cytopenias the defendant kenmare capital partners ltd describes its business on its letterhead as investment banking and technology assessment for biosciences its promotional brochure elaborates our services are strategically focused at raising public and private capital for our clients and maximizing shareholder value the brochure goes on to boast that kenmare has well established longterm

investment banking and virginia rybski responsible for technology assessment neither kenmare nor its principals are or were at any relevant time registered as brokerdealers or agents under the massachusetts securities law g l c a novellos and kenmare entered into the agreement that gives rise to this dispute on august   the parties agree that caulfield drafted the agreement although kenmare

labeled advisors compensation for alternative transaction provides in its entirety in the event of the sale merger or joint venture of the company or the sale or licensing of any significant assets

the recipients undertaking that the information provided are not to be used for any purpose other than in connection with the recipients consideration of the purchase of the common stock     the memorandum goes on to recite that kenmare is furnishing it solely for the consideration of institutional and other accredited investors who have the knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and the capability to conduct their own due diligence investigation and evaluation in connection with the investment and that the securities offered in this memorandum are being sold as a private offering    and accordingly are not being registered under the securities act     the securities described herein are being offered to a limited number of institutional and other accredited investors     neither this memorandum nor its delivery to any prospective investor shall constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy the company or its securities the memorandum indicated that all inquiries should be directed to kenmare also included in the memorandum was a revised term sheet similar to the previous one but showing gross proceeds of  with a closing date of on or before march   according to kenmares interrogatory answer the executive summary was completed on or about september   and sent to several pharmaceutical companies     during the period september   to january  kenmare received responses from the pharmaceutical companies    indicating no interest the private offering memorandum according to kenmares answers to interrogatories was intended to be a marketing document to solicit interest    from the pharmaceutical companies for an alternative transaction and secondarily for professional venture capital investors and to be used as a document for novelos to solicit individual private investors caulfields affidavit elaborates asserting that kenmare prepared the private offering memorandum intending it to be used more as a marketing document to solicit interest in the novelos technology from pharmaceutical companies in regard to alternative transactions than in an attempt to solicit private equity investors this approach according to caulfields affidavit was because caulfield believed that the  cost of clinical trials based on the cytopenia strategy made the private placement of equity securities unrealistic in february of  caulfield sent copies of the memorandum with cover letters to potential investors the cover letters asserted variously that novelos is going to be a blockbuster and its initial investors are going to enjoy real increases in wealth we believe that this is an extraordinary opportunity to benefit society and create wealth our objective is to complete the deal either publicly or privately as quickly as possible i believe you will find this to be a very exciting investment opportunity and that due diligence files are available for review the responses received were uniformly negative confirming caulfields view according to his affidavit that the marketing strategy based upon the use of the novelos technology for treatment of blood disorders was not a viable strategy for that reason both parties allowed the original january   so called deadline for the first stage of a private placement to pass notwithstanding the fact that no equity securities had been placed during january february march and april of  the parties continued to work together under the frame work of the august   agreement towards the end of effectuating alternative transactions for the benefit of novelos according to kenmares answers to interrogatories between september  and july  kenmare sent about  confidential offering memorandums sic to pharmaceutical companies and venture capital investment organizations and novelos sent about  confidential offering memorandums sic to individuals and others for investment and public relations purposes except for the individual investors that novelos solicited and who invested in novelos the response from the other solicitations    was not interested     in summary the executive summary and confidential private placement memorandum test market program proved between september  and july  that the novelos    cytopenia clinical development strategy was a big loser kenmares interrogatory answer goes on to recite that on or about march   over noveloss objection it published its own review of certain information it had received from novelos expressing the conclusion that the data clearly establishes that the united states clinical studies should include nonsmall cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer with survival as an endpoint such studies kenmare asserts would be a fraction of the cost of the cytopenia indication kenmare prepared documents based on its newly proposed approach and submitted those documents to a potential investor known as the medicines company novelos adopted the new strategy and the medicines company used their proprietary software to design a clinical development program at a cost of between two and three million dollars thus according to kenmare novelos received and accepted the intellectual capital of kenmare and the medicines company which intellectual capital identified the nonsmall cell lung cancer indication and created the design of the novelos clinical development program according to kenmares interrogatory answer kenmares work thus created real capital for novelos and novelos received a benefit of about  million cost of cytopenia clinical development program less about  million cost of the new novelos clinical development program thereafter however in april  according to kenmares interrogatory answer novelos informed kenmare that kenmare could present the nonsmall cell lung cancer business plan clinical development program to pharmaceutical companies and venture capital investors but novelos planned to continue with the cytopenia indication simyon palmin stated according to kenmares interrogatory answer that the medicines company is not going to run novelos business and nonsmall lung cancer is a kenmare strategy not a novelos strategy despite this position according to kenmare novelos did adopt the nonsmall cell lung cancer strategy incorporating it into a proposed development plan dated may   and into a filing with the food and drug administration in august  in july  according to kenmares interrogatory answer novelos and newcastle pharmaceuticals entered into an agreement for the purchase of the exclusive cancer rights to the novelos drug bam for  million     the private placement and alternative investment strategy was pursued by newcastle to obtain funding for novelos until the contract terminated on march   according to caulfields affidavit in late august of  simyon palmin told caulfield that he wanted to rewrite the august   agreement to reflect the developments of the preceding year meaning to me that he still considered the agreement to be operative on november   according to caulfields affidavit harry palmin president of novelos faxed to caulfield a proposed new agreement the proposal a copy of which is appended to caulfields affidavit is headed draft of agreement for advisory services to sell marketingdistribution rights it recites that novelos proposes to compensate kenmare for helping novelos sell marketingdistribution rights    to pharmaceutical companies at specified commission rates depending on the relative roles of kenmare and novelos with respect to any particular purchaser the draft also indicates that this agreement should supercede any previous agreements although this proposal did not culminate in agreement caulfield and harry palmin did agree according to caulfields affidavit that kenmare was entitled to some compensation in the area of  in consideration for the value of kenmares services in redirecting their clinical development and business strategy on november   kenmare sent novelos an invoice for its services in the amount of  plus warrants for the purchase of  shares of novelos stock caulfields affidavit asserts that he sent the invoice in order to expedite negotiations over the amount due kenmare the invoice in the form of a letter from caulfield to harry palmin claimed that novelos was entitled to payment because our advisory services are responsible for the change in the novelos business plan and went on to detail the advisory services for which kenmare claimed credit the invoice identified the amount charged as consisting of three components a a thirteen percent commission on  in savings for clinical trials resulting from the change in strategy b a commission of six and one half percent on  in notes sold by novelos to investors between august   and november   and c a commission on the sale of rights to newcastle pharmaceuticals in the amount of thirteen percent of the first  raised and two percent on any additional funds raised the invoice also asserted that kenmare would be entitled to commissions on any future transaction with any pharmaceutical company with which it had negotiated confidential disclosure agreements noveloss response to kenmares invoice according to caulfields affidavit was that novelos then considered the agreement to have terminated because no private placement had occurred by january   kenmare believes according to caulfields affidavit that after the initiation of this litigation novelos has engaged in alternative transactions utilizing the business strategy kenmare proposed in the spring of  among these kenmare asserts are a license agreement with phytera inc in july  and sales of convertible notes in august and october of  to purchasers affiliated with something referred to as the masthead entities novelos offers evidence which kenmare does not contest that kenmare never had any contact with either masthead or phytera on behalf of novelos kenmare contends that it would elicit evidence of additional such transactions if permitted to conduct further discovery on this topic in answer to noveloss interrogatory regarding the amount and basis of the compensation to which kenmare claims it is entitled kenmare refers to its invoice of november   reiterating the contentions and calculations set forth there kenmares answer also asserts that it provided certain additional services and advice not recited in the invoice and that the work was performed continuously from the date of the advisory agreement august   to march   by kenmare full time with the exception of ten days when virginia rybski was otherwise engaged novelos brought this action on march   its complaint alleges fraud by both kenmare and caulfield counts i and ii and seeks a declaration that it owes kenmare no compensation under the contract count iii after some initial procedural skirmishes kenmare and caulfield answered with kenmare asserting a counterclaim for damages on theories of breach of contract count i breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing count ii quantum meruit count iii unjust enrichment count v and violation of g l c a count iv novelos now seeks summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim and on kenmares counterclaims it contends that no compensation is due under the contract on two alternative grounds first novelos contends that the contract was void ab initio pursuant to g l c  § f because it provided for conduct in violation of c a § a second novelos contends that even if the contract or some part of it were enforceable kenmare would be entitled to no compensation under its terms because kenmare failed to accomplish the only task for which the contract provided for it to be compensated  that is the raising of capital for novelos as to the other counterclaims novelos contends that the existence of a contract for commission based compensation under which no commission is due precludes recovery on any of the theories asserted discussion this court grants summary judgment where no genuine issues of material fact exist and the undisputed facts entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law hakim v massachusetts insurers insolvency fund  mass    cassesso v commissioner of correction  mass    community natl bank v dawes  mass    mass r civ p c the moving party bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that there is no genuine dispute of material fact on every relevant issue pederson v time inc  mass    a party moving for summary judgment who does not bear the burden of proof at trial may demonstrate the absence of a triable issue either by submitting affirmative evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving partys case or by showing that the nonmoving party has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of the claim at trial kourouvacilis v general motors corp  mass    once the moving party establishes the absence of a triable issue the party opposing the motion must respond and allege specific facts establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact pederson  mass at  to avoid summary judgment an opposing party may not rely upon his pleadings or bald conclusions but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial united states trust co of new york v herriott  mass app ct    see also trustees of tufts college v parlane sportswear co inc  mass app ct     application of g l c a § f chapter a of the general laws regulates the sale of securities in massachusetts section  of c a provides that it is unlawful for any person to transact business in the commonwealth as a brokerdealer or agent unless he is registered under this chapter section c defines brokerdealer as any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others or for his own account subject to certain exclusions not applicable here the statute does not define effecting transactions that phrase derives content however from § a which imposes civil liability on any person who offers or sells a security in violation of section a offer is defined in § i as including every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to bury a security or interest in a security for value see generally commonwealth v david  mass    giordano v auditore  mass    discussing scope of statute the statute provides a variety of consequences for violations including civil investigations by the secretary of state § a administrative cease and desist orders § a injunctions  §  criminal penalties § a and civil liability § a section § f establishes an additional consequence as follows no person who has made or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder or who has acquired any purported right under any such contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making or performance was in violation may base any suit on the contract the undisputed facts as set out supra leave no room for doubt that the contract on which kenmare bases its claim provided for it to solicit investors for the purchase of novelos stock and that kenmare in fact did so albeit unsuccessfully pursuant to the contract for a period of over a year further the undisputed facts establish that kenmare engaged in that activity as its principal if not sole business during that period the contract thus provided for kenmare to act as a brokerdealer although unregistered in violation of § a it follows that kenmare may not base any suit on the contract kenmare seeks to avoid this conclusion by minimizing its activities in connection with efforts to sell stock and emphasizing instead its efforts to effectuate an alternative transaction as defined in paragraph  of the agreement under its plain terms however § f applies to a contract that calls for conduct in violation of the statute regardless of the actual activities of the parties under that contract here there is no question that the contract called for kenmare to solicit investors to purchase novelos stock section f thus renders the contract unenforceable regardless of the extent to which kenmare actually did so kenmares next argument is that even if § f would bar enforcement of the provisions of the contract relating to placement of stock it does not bar enforcement of paragraph a under which kenmare claims a commission for what it seeks to characterize as alternative transactions in support of this argument kenmare relies on cadillac auto co of boston v engeian  mass    the issue presented there was whether a forum selection clause unenforceable under massachusetts law as then existing rendered void the entire contract of guaranty in which it appeared the court held that it did not applying the general rule that if the part of a contract    which is valid can be separated from that which is void and carried into effect it may be done because the clause in question goes only to the method of settlement of disputes under the contract    and does not impair the substantive rights under it the court held the offending provision severable and enforced the remainder of the contract the difference between this case and cadillac auto co of boston is obvious here the illegality is not a minor provision relating solely to dispute resolution or some other incidental matter rather the essence of the contract is an agreement for kenmare to do exactly what the statute prohibits see green v richmond  mass    there can be no recovery if the performance was in fact illegal and the illegality was serious and not merely an incidental part of the performance of the agreement more fundamentally the severability doctrine applied in cadillac auto is a rule of contract interpretation not one of statutory construction the question here is not what the parties meant in their agreement but what the legislature meant in enacting § f the answer to that question is apparent in the plain language of the statute barring any suit based    on the contract the legislature did not limit the bar to those portions of a contract that call for conduct in violation of the statute rather the plain language of § f bars any claim under the entire contract the purpose of such a broad rule is apparent the legislature sought to promote compliance with the statute and to deter its violation by imposing severe and automatic consequences accordingly novelos is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim for declaratory judgment and on counts i and ii of kenmares complaint both of which are explicitly based on the contract kenmares c a claim must fail as well since it depends on the allegation that novelos refused to pay compensation due under the contract kenmare contends that it remains entitled to compensation for its services on theories of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment its argument in substance is that even if it cannot obtain a commission under the contract on capital raised novelos is obligated to pay it for the value of the business advice it provided to prevail on this theory kenmare would have to show that novelos reasonably should have expected to pay for kenmares business advice apart from any commissions that kenmare would have been due under the contract see j a sullivan corp v commonwealth  mass    lattuca v cusolito  mass    community builders inc v indian motorcycle associates inc  mass app ct    the evidence offered is devoid of anything to indicate that kenmare could make that showing at trial to the contrary the undisputed facts considered in the light most favorable to kenmare indicate that the parties agreed to payment only pursuant to the contract in the form of commissions on capital raised by means of the sale of stock or the alternative transactions specified in the contract and that kenmare provided its services in the context of its effort to perform the contract under these circumstances recovery on the alternate theories proposed would be indistinguishable from enforcement of the contract which the statute prohibits accordingly novelos is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on counts iii and v of kenmares counterclaim conclusion and order for the reasons stated it is hereby ordered that novelos therapeutics incs motion for partial summary judgment is allowed judith fabricant justice of the superior court june   footnotes after two hearings on the present motions defendants informed the court that prior to either of those hearings defendant caulfield but not kenmare had filed a petition for bankruptcy protection triggering the automatic stay of claims against him under the bankruptcy code accordingly the court will address the present motions only as to kenmare and not as to caulfield the parties dispute whether novelos knew at the time of the contract that kenmare was unregistered caulfield asserts in his affidavit that he made repeated full disclosure and that he relied on legal advice from noveloss attorney conveyed to him through simyon palmin of novelos that so long as we left the price and quantity terms blank in any offering documents that those documents would not constitute an offering for purposes of the blue sky act and that therefore neither novelos nor kenmare would be violating the act palmin asserts in his affidavit that he believed kenmare and caulfield to be legally authorized to conduct the offering and sale of securities and that novelos relied on that belief this date was apparently intended to be january   the cover letters refer to the enclosure as a prospectus but the record identifies no document to which this term might refer other than the private offering memorandum this date appears inconsistent with the other information provided but the record does not clarify kenmares use of the word published leaves some uncertainty as to whether it made the report public over the objection of its own client or merely released it to novelos and other entities involved with noveloss business the record provides little additional explanation of this transaction the parties references to it suggest that it did not actually generate any capital for novelos but rather involved an undertaking by newcastle apparently unsuccessful to attempt to raise capital through the resale of rights one of the exclusions is an agent which the § b defines as any individual other than a brokerdealer who represents a brokerdealer or issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities subject to certain exclusions at the second hearing on these motions after initially attempting to characterize itself as an agent kenmare acknowledged that it cannot fall within that definition since it is not an individual kenmare suggests that it was not in the business of effecting such transactions because the transaction contemplated by the agreement was the only such transaction kenmare has ever been involved in as a business corporation however kenmare can hardly avoid the conclusion that it was in the business of the activity that occupied virtually all of its effort  am mon january   fulltext opinions admin next  – bellin v kelley jr et al leave a reply cancel replyyou must be logged in to post a comment get
