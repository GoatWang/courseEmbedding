protective barrier to injured tissue and reduces the risk of infection  psychological stress is known to modulate inflammatory responses avitsur et al 0 and slow the healing of experimental cutaneous and mucosal wounds in humans kiecoltglaser et al  marucha et al  it has been shown that slowed healing is associated with activation of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis hpa and sympathetic nervous system padgett et al  which in turn is associated with diminished mononuclear cell trafficking padgett et al  and reduced expression of cytokine chemokine and growth factor genes in wound tissue mercado et al 0  in addition stress reduces oxygen content in wound tissue gajendrareddy et al 0 and increases the susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infections rojas et al 0  additional data generated thus far have shown that stress alters inflammatory gene expression fibroblast proliferation angiogenesis wound contraction and reepithelialization thus significant components of wound healing are negatively affected by stressinduced activation of neuroendocrine pathways and altered wound oxygen content the goal of this project is to determine the mechanism by which psychological stress has a significant effect on chemokine proinflammatory cytokine and growth factor gene expression during wound healing  team members nicole powell phd research scientist latonia stiner phd
