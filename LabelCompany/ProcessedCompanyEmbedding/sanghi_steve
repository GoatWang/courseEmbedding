lapedus  pm edt post a comment no ratingslogin to rate tweet steve sanghi joined microchip technology inc as president and ceo in when the company was near liquidationand engineered a remarkable turnaround today microchip is the worlds leading supplier of bit microcontrollers has branched out into bit mcus and analog and surpassed the  billion sales mark in fiscal  ended march  in an interview with ee times mark lapedus sanghi pulled no punches as he weighed in on the chip industry at large the privateequity steamroller the fab lite model and microchips place in it all ee times what is the general state of the semiconductor industry steve sanghi the industry in my view has a historical challenge that its leadership has yet to recognize in some cases where it has recognized the challenge the industry doesnt know how to deal with it semiconductors are a  billion industry historically the semiconductor industry has been built on growing  to  percent a year this cannot happen forever semiconductor companies are also largely built on these ideas build it and they will come price the parts for tomorrow moores law move to the next geometry but the industry is slowing most pundits say the semiconductor industry will grow  to  percent a year the semiconductor industry needs to adjust to these mature growth rates but im not sure it knows how to do so and the build it and they will come idea just wont happen anymore ee times what is your view of private equity sanghi its not a new concept its happened in many industries before basically money is too cheap for the private equities to get thats the bottom line they can raise billions of dollars in no time meanwhile the semiconductor industry has taken a lot of hits in the stock market the stocks have gone nowhere so private equity comes in and they believe that semiconductor companies are sitting on alltime historichigh cash flows however i believe some of these privateequity deals will go bust i believe private equity is going into the excessive bubble phase ee times is microchip pondering the privateequity route sanghi private equity doesnt talk about us they talk about buying atmel ee times the industry is worried about soaring fab mask and design costs are you sanghi i dont see a step function change here its been going on for  years twoinch masks were more expensive than oneinch masks fourinch masks were more than twoinch and so on in terms of design thats where programmability comes in microchip serves  customers if we tried to make an bit product for each customer and each customer had to make a mask the cost would be prohibitive so we develop one programmable device and every design team can write its firmware and customize its end product for an application ee times the company was at a low point when you joined in  microchip is a turnaround story right sanghi when i joined the company microchip was up for sale in liquidation our sales were flat to dropping the majority of our sales were commodity eprom we were losing  million a quarter and manufacturing was pathetic the problems were so widespread that i needed a new formula i didnt take any of the proposals from the consultants we really needed to design our own system years later we ended up giving it a name the aggregate system it essentially means to redesign the enterprise with all parts of the company working together ee times what was the strategy sanghi in the product area the company was involved in too many point products and the majority of rd was going into eprom which was highly commoditized and making negative gross margins so we deemphasized commodity eprom and focused on bit microcontrollers microchip also had an effort in building dsps in competition with ti i got out of that business in the process development area microchip was several generations behind in manufacturing our yields were pathetic so i decided to leapfrog technology development ee times whats the outlook for calendar  and what can you say about  sanghi we expect another record year in  last year was a record for us it was the first year we crossed over  billion in sales in both the calendar  and fiscal  years the surprise last year was in fact that calendar q was down for most companies which was the start of the current inventory correction all of the customers and everybody were saying they had no inventory and all of the sudden there was inventory ee times have we seen the last of the inventory glut sanghi cell phones had a lot of inventory any company that is deeply focused on cell phones had a significant reduction in sales second within the cell phone you did better if you had share in nokia and you did worse if you had share in motorola motorola lost share the companies exposed to motorola arent doing well microchips commentary at the end of last quarter was that we were seeing the worst of the inventory correction in the rearview mirror we guided our march quarter to be flat sequentially later on in march we gave an update to that the march quarter will be flat to slightly up sequentially ee times what is driving saleswhats your next killer app sanghi microchips strategy is not to look for the next killer application or killer market were not a killerapplicationdependent company were essentially in all of the hot products we are in ipods and accessories we are in gaming platforms we are in settop boxes and tivos were balanced by industry segment the largest portion of our business is consumer the second largest is automotive then industrial and computing in the past medical had been part of industrial we started the medicalproducts group because we saw an increasing need and an increased use of devices in medical applications ee times what are the hot geographic markets for the company sanghi europe has been between  to  percent of our business for the last seven or eight years the americas region had been as much  percent of our business now its smaller thats not because the americas region is growing slower a lot of american companies design products here and give them to subcontractors that buy products in asia asia has grown from  percent of our business to  percent of our business in the last seven or eight years ee times there is some debate about who is really leading the bit controller market is it freescale microchip or renesas and whats driving the business sanghi is there a doubt whos leading the bit market we were at the bottom in  and at the top in  in bit there are new applications there are microcontrollers today in hedge trimmers lawn mowersthings you never thought about ee times what is your share in bit mcus sanghi its small were just entering into the fourth year of volume production in bit but were doing well our bit business was up  to  percent last year its our fastest growth market the second highest growth market for us is analog analog was up  percent ee times what is microchips fab strategy sanghi ti is getting a lot of air time with the hybrid or fab lite strategy thats the same strategy weve been telling investors about for several years now we have two fabs in production fab  and fab  the mm fabs are in tempe ariz and gresham ore fab  no longer exists fab  in puyallup wash purchased from matsushita in  is available if anyone wants to buy it its been up for sale for years i think fab  will get sold if it doesnt get sold i could equip it but if i need another fab i think i can buy a fully equipped fab cheaper than the cost of equipping fab  ee times has microchip thought of going fabless do you use foundries sanghi we dont want to go fabless tsmc builds generalpurpose products our micron technology inhouse in many cases can give smaller die sizes than competitive micron technologies that are built at foundries we can also customize our devices we dont want to lose that but we are also using a number of professional foundries in taiwan and other places we use foundries if we dont have a given technology it could be highvoltage bicmos lowvoltage or rf right now our outsourced production is in the low single digits it will be going up from low single digits to  percent ee times will microchip build another fab sanghi we dont ever build fabs we buy other peoples mistakes the world is going to  mm where i dont need to go our products dont require the bleeding edge of lithography at  nm there are so many mm fabs that are up for sale and going on the market we also have additional cleanroom capacity in our oregon fab n steve sanghi
