had begun building his newspaper empire another enterprising man began his with help from local investors aw alfred wilson lee in  started out smallvery smallbuying the circulation ottumwa courier in iowa the paper was one of three dailies in ottumwa back then according to lee enterprises company history and its circulation increased by a whopping  percent to  in the next  years over the decades the company continued to exhibit a penchant for hometown midwestern publications the lee family name disappeared from the companys personnel relatively early though lees daughter held controlling stock in the handful of papers he and associates owned lee before his death bequeathed operating control to two business colleagues ep emanuel philip adler and james f powell in  the companywhich then included a collection of montana papers as well as dailies in wisconsin oregon illinois and nebraskawent public three years later lloyd schermer husband of betty adler granddaughter of ep adler became president and ceo and held those positions until  staying on as chairman of the board of directors until january  a harvard business school graduate schermer had made the missoulian in montana into something of an environmental activist paper when he was publisher there from  to  running stories and editorials criticizing industrial practices that polluted the states rivers as president schermer says one of his goals was to keep the company independent the fact that the schermer family and some key friends own a large portion of the stock he says has enabled the company to avoid a takeover dick gottlieb a greatgreat nephew to ep adler served as ceo from  to  gottlieb was the first to look outside the company and notably to the opposite sex to find his successor in mary junck she was in the process of leaving an executive vice president position at times mirror where she oversaw the companys eastern newspapers in  i left times mirror because i didnt think it was much fun she says gottlieb hired her as an executive vice president and chief operating officer that year junck became president the following year and started collecting titles until she was also ceo and chairman by january  junck  is universally admired for her enthusiasm and her downtoearth personality as postdispatch senior writer harry levins says of the visit to st louis by junck and other lee executives they didnt come across as corporate slickies not in the least vice president of interactive media gregory p schermer the only corporate officer with a connection to the original family ownership sums up what its like to have junck as a boss working with mary is fun he says and i think one of the things that makes it fun to work with mary and sets mary apart as a leader is her genuine interest in soliciting and listening to the opinions of her team although junck has a masters in journalism from the university of north carolina at chapel hill she got her start on the business side as a marketing research manager at the charlotte observer in  her bio includes stints as publisher of the baltimore sun and st paul pioneer press she just so happens to be an iowa native from the town of ogden lee sold off some television properties under gottlieb let its ottumwa paper go in  and has grown rapidly in recent years junck has become ms acquisitions since she took over more than doubling the companys revenue in three years the chain has focused on gobbling up newspapers of  circulation or more a benchmark for papers that would have strong local markets she says junck says she still seeks advice from dick gottlieb and lloyd schermer though neither plays an official role in the company now retired and splitting his time between colorado and arizona schermer  says the mainstream press may grab all those bigname prizes but he cares about the difference lees main street press can make in a community building a reputation among the major players isnt a big deal to schermer whats important is getting something done he says in terms of putting out good local newspapers that have an impact on the local community i think were damn good at it and well be even better under mary for
