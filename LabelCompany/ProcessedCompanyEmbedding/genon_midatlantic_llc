comply with the passage of a  maryland environmental law genon undertook the upgrade of the air quality control systems at three of its power plants genon i  wl  at  under the turnkey agreement dated july   shaw was to design and build these improved air quality control systems id compensation under the contract was not fixed but would be determined by applying a formula containing two variables  the target cost set out in the contract and  the total amount of reimbursable costs incurred by the contractor to complete the work or the actual costs id the target cost was also subject to modification by change order genon brought this declaratory judgment action claiming that it does not have to pay shaw for some of the work performed above the contract amounts after cost overruns for the project were projected to exceed  million id the document in dispute consists of financial spreadsheets and illustrations graphing the calculations contained in the spreadsheets the spreadsheet originally created in  shows the combination of charges and change orders that would maximize defendant shaws profits on the project based on the elaborate compensation formulas provided for under the

absent the prospect of litigation do not receive work product protection gucci am inc v guess inc  frd   sdny  at the same time a document prepared because of the prospect of litigation does not lose its workproduct protection merely because it may assist in business decisions adlman  fd at  we hold that a document created because of anticipated litigation which tends to reveal mental impressions conclusions opinions or theories concerning the litigation does not lose workproduct protection merely because it is intended to assist in the making of a business decision influenced by the likely outcome of the anticipated litigation if a document is work product the privilege applies unless the party opposing the privilege can demonstrate substantial need for the document id at  iii discussion shaw asserts that the disputed document is privileged work product which was created in preparation for the mediation between genon and shaw scheduled for march   shaws brief  the document has a creation date of  because it was based off a document created earlier by genons sourcing manager priya gill gill shaws brief ex  ferguson decl ¶  in january or february  michael a branca outside counsel for shaw requested stone  webster inc to create scenarios showing how the compensation factors in section  of the contract would operate under various potential outcomes of the various disputed costs and change orders id at ¶  peter ferguson ferguson shaws project director forwarded the document to greg hill and mark monahan to develop these compensation scenarios under relevant articles of the parties contract id at ¶  to assist in illustrating how the compensation formulas worked as guidance for mr branca at the mediation shaws brief  shaw has submitted a declaration in support of these assertions from ferguson which avers that document no shaw e was created solely as the result of mr brancas request as passed on by me to messrs hill and monahan stone  webster had not previously created such scenarios ferguson decl ¶  genon asserts that this document was created in the ordinary course of business genon reply  according to genon shaw and genon have both created similar compensation scenarios throughout their business relationship as evidenced for example by the fact that the original spreadsheets that the document was based off of came from gill id at  further genon asserts that the purpose of this document was for shaw to determine how to maximize its profits as demonstrated by shaws alteration of its change order and accounting assertions after updating the spreadsheet in february  such that by june  shaw claimed it was entitled to change orders placing it near the peak compensation zone identified in the february  calculations id at  based on the explanation presented by shaw including the sworn declaration of ferguson this document is protected work product the document would not have been created in the same form irrespective of the litigation but rather was created specifically in preparation for mediation adlman  fd at   where a document was created because of anticipated litigation and would not have been prepared in substantially similar form but for the prospect of that litigation it falls within rule b the protection of rule b is not limited exclusively to materials prepared to assist at trial id at  the text of rule b does not limit its protection to materials prepared to assist at trial to the contrary the text of the rule clearly sweeps more broadly it expressly states that workproduct privilege applies not only to documents prepared  for trial but also to those prepared in anticipation of litigation  quoting frcp ba even if as genon argues the document was used by shaw to determine what levels of change orders and charges to assert against genon because the document was prepared because of litigation to assist with an upcoming mediation the workproduct privilege applies adlman  fd at  finding that a document prepared because of litigation does not lose its workproduct protection merely because it may be used to assist in business decisions shaw has met its heavy burden in re grand jury subpoenas  fd at  of demonstrating that this document would not have been prepared in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation adlman  fd at  genon has not presented evidence of a substantial need for the document to overcome the privilege id at  genon makes two additional arguments relying on the earlier decisions by judge maas and myself addressing various assertions of privilege both arguments fail first genon asserts that the situation addressed by my decision on june   was very similar genon brief  there i found that documents created in connection with genons thirdparty audit of shaws accounting information were not entitled to workproduct protection explaining that the documents served a dual purpose of fulfilling a contractual right in the ordinary course of business and also assessing the availability and strength of potential legal claims genon i  wl  at  that situation however is clearly distinguishable those documents were created because of the provision in the turnkey agreement for such audits this document on the other hand was created because of a lawyers request to help him prepare for mediation second genon has suggested to shaw that judge maass recent privilege ruling resolves this issue to the extent that genon believes this to be the case i agree with shaw that judge maas has simply not reached the issue because it was not before him first judge maas did not consider document e genon ii  wl  further the similar documents addressed by judge maas were financial reporting and other accounting documents withheld by shaw on the grounds of attorneyclient privilege not workproduct doctrine genon ii  wl  at  in fact judge maas specifically recognized that the workproduct doctrine was not an argument before him and noted that his decision might be different were shaw arguing mat the documents were protected work product while at least some of these documents could conceivably constitute work product shaw failed to rely on the work product doctrine with respect to them in its privilege log accordingly any work product protection that shaw might have been entitled to assert has been waived id at  n conclusion for the foregoing reasons genons letter motion to find document e not privileged is denied footnotes  those depositions have already taken place shaw was given a choice between allowing the document to be introduced at the depositions and objecting on privilege grounds or precluding the document at the depositions but filing more complete briefing shaw elected option  and the additional briefs are now before the court  change orders are added to or deleted from the original scope of work of a contract which alter the original contract amount or completion date of the project a change order could stem from a legitimate previously unknown obstacle to a project or from a contractors addition of fees and work items through change orders once they have obtained the contract an exploitive tactic  on november   we received an additional letter from shaw which indicates that genon has suggested that judge maas addressed documents similar to the e and has resolved the issue of privilege with respect to this document letter from shaw nov   i reach this argument here by way of completeness it does not appear in genons brief comment your name your email comments  characters remaining

plaintiffs v stone  webster inc defendant united states district court sd new york june   opinion and order harold baer jr district judge before the court are motions by plaintiffscounterclaim defendants genon midatlantic llc and genon chalk point llc collectively genon to enforce an order of this court and to quash a subpoena as well as motions by defendantcounterclaim plaintiff stone  webster to compel production of the subpoenaed documents and to disqualify genons counsel and a potential expert witness for the reasons that follow genons motion to enforce is granted and its motion to quash is denied stone  websters motion to compel is granted and its motion to disqualify is denied i background this lawsuit arises out of an agreement dated july   between genon and stone  webster the turnkey agreement under the turnkey agreement stone  webster would design and build certain air quality control systems known as wet scrubbers at three of genons maryland power plants the upgrade was necessary to ensure compliance with marylands healthy air act which became effective january   the amount payable to stone  webster was not fixed but was to be determined by applying a formula containing two variables  the target cost set out in the contract and  the total amount of reimbursable costs incurred by the contractor to complete the work the actual costs the formula is intended to reward the contractor if its actual costs are less than the target and discourage it from incurring actual costs greater than the target the target cost was subject to modification by change order on grounds set forth in the turnkey agreeement thus the amount payable to stone  webster under the turnkey agreement cannot be determined until the amount of all change orders are known and stone  webster has submitted to genon a final accounting of its actual costs stone  webster is contractually bound to provide this final accounting on an open book basis which means essentially that it must make available all relevant books records schedules logs and electronic communications and data in order to substantiate the costs and expenses incurred turnkey agreement §§  in view of cost overruns projected at one point to exceed  million genon filed this lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that it need not pay certain costs and invoices its complaint focuses on allegedly improper billings by stone  webster that breach the turnkey agreement in  stone  webster indicated that its actual costs would exceed the initial target cost genon exercised its audit rights under the turnkey agreement to obtain cost information and concluded that the cost overruns were due to improper manipulation and abuse for example genon points to data indicating that stone  webster billed it for excessive hourly wages eg charging hour for  hours logged by a safety manager who stone  webster paid hour and kept financial records for itself that differed from those created for genon in its counterclaim stone  webster contends that above and beyond what it has already received it is entitled to an amount in excess of  under the turnkey agreement it posits that genons failure to pay constitutes a breach of contract ii genons motion to enforce the order dated april   genon has moved to enforce a pretrial scheduling order dated april   the order that required production of certain documents as they become available it claims that stone  websters rule  disclosures and initial document productions make clear that stone  webster has withheld discoverable documents that come within the scope of the order genon focuses on two categories of documents final accounting documents and change order documents stone  webster has apparently provided a final accounting but not what genon refers to as the underlying source documents to substantiate that accounting similarly genon has requested documents that support and substantiate the change orders that stone  webster has submitted or will submit as described above and on the record from oral argument genon is entitled to such documents under the turnkey agreement and requested them in its document requests according to the parties stone  webster has produced some of the underlying source documents that exist in hardcopy and is preparing to produce those that exist in electronic format nonetheless certain hardcopy documents remain outstanding including but not limited to invoices from vendors expense reports for salaried personnel and nonconfidential information contained in personnel records eg curricula vitae these and any other outstanding hardcopy source documents must be produced forthwith and all source documents that exist in electronic format must be produced so as to conform to the timetable agreed or ordered by the court iii the motions to quash and compel on april   stone  webster served a subpoena on fti consulting inc fti the documents it seeks relate to an audit that fti performed in  at genons behest fti was retained on september   by alston  bird genons legal counsel to provide genon with its confidential analysis of stone  websters accounting data in july  genon exercised its contractual rights to audit stone  websters accounting and requested that stone  webster provide fti access to certain information there was some dispute around whether and how such access would be granted but ultimately stone  webster and fti executed a confidentiality agreement dated september   and the audit proceeded according to stone  webster who has now subpoenaed fti while alston  bird arranged and directed the audit stone  webster was never made aware of the involvement of legal counsel to the contrary stone  webster shows that counsels participation was not disclosed and genon represented that genon and not alston  bird had retained fti see defs oppn to mot to quash at  according to stone  webster the fti audit contains the basis for genons lawsuit and is necessary to form its defense genon now moves to have the fti subpoena quashed or for a protective order on the basis of workproduct privilege stone  webster moves to compel compliance with the subpoena and also seeks to have fti disqualified as an expert and alston  bird disqualified as attorneys the work product doctrine established in hickman v taylor  us   and codified in frcp b precludes the discovery of documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation for litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative including the other partys attorney consultant surety indemnitor insurer or

horn  hardart co v pillsbury co  fd   d cir  the party claiming work product protection bears the heavy burden of establishing that it applies in re grand jury subpoenas dated march   and august    fd   d cir  ftis records in this case appear to serve a dual purpose they were made pursuant to a contractual right in the ordinary course of business to determine what was due and owing and they were made to assess the availability and strength of potential legal claims to determine whether the work product protection applies here the court must decide if in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case the documents can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the litigation united states v adlman  fd   d cir  emphasis in original where documents serve a dual purpose the second circuit has emphasized that the because of formulation    withholds protection from documents that are prepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation it is well established that workproduct privilege does not apply to such documents id the nature of the fti records can be characterized as audit documents created pursuant to rights bargained for in a business contract when fti approached stone  webster about the audit it acted under authority of this contractually mandated audit procedure and there was no representation that any portion of the audit went above and beyond what was contemplated by the turnkey agreement neither has genon argued that the audit contains information beyond that which would have been recorded in the ordinary course under the contractual audit provisions i cannot conclude but that the documents would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of genons declaratory judgment action id genons arguments about the factual situation surrounding ftis engagement are unavailing it asserts that projected delays — which it admits were not fully realized — and possible accounting irregularities made litigation a real possibility by the time fti was engaged in  slavis decl ¶¶   however it concedes that it retained fti to help gather and analyze stone  websters cost data and to evaluate genons options for negotiation and litigation should negotiations prove unsuccessful pls oppn to mot compel at  as recognized by the northern district of illinois under adlman even where an engagement letter states that an auditor is retained in anticipation of litigation and even where the party retaining the auditor has a reasonable good faith belief that it might end up in litigation the audit will not be protected where the documents would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of litigation see gm harston const co inc v city of chicago no cv jbm  wl   nd ill  applying adlman  fd at  routing such an audit through an attorney does not confer work product privilege on the audit records where as here there is no suggestion that the records contain attorneys mental impressions or litigation strategies — material at the heart of the work product doctrine see frcp bb adlman  fd at  as the district court in illinois recognized those strategies may be shaped by such a report but that is true of all information available to attorneys and accessible through discovery harston  wl   genon has pointed to nothing that is protected by frcp b stone  webster also moves to disqualify fti as an expert on the grounds that stone  webster shared a prior confidential relationship with fti and provided it with confidential documents however it misconstrues the relevant test for expert disqualification and alleges that confidential information was provided within a confidential relationship created by the agreement executed by fti and stone  webster on september   even if this is the proper relationship to focus on — as opposed to a relationship prior to the one out of which disclosures were made — it is difficult to see how any expectation of confidentiality could have been reasonable here fti was retained not by stone  webster — the party seeking disqualification — but by its counterparty this fails to satisfy the basic test for expert disqualification which requires an affirmative answer to the questions  was it objectively reasonable for the first party who claims to have retained the expert to conclude that a confidential relationship existed and  was any confidential or privileged information disclosed by the first party to the expert bristolmyers squibb co v rhonepoulenc rorer inc no cv rpp  wl   sdny  moreover stone  webster has not shown how any information it provided is confidential or privileged to the contrary it was contractually obligated to disclose the information that it provided to fti stone  websters motion to disqualify counsel falls similarly short with rare exceptions disqualification is limited to situations that involve conflicts of interest or an attorneys potential to use against an opposing party information gained through a prior representation of the opposing party see bd of educ v nyquist  fd    neither situation obtains here and stone  webster fails to show that disqualification is otherwise warranted i have considered the parties remaining arguments and find them unavailing iv conclusion for the foregoing reasons stone  webster will proceed in accordance with this discussion and the relevant scheduling orders genons motion to quash or for a protective order is denied stone  websters motion to compel is granted and stone  websters motion to disqualify is denied the parties are directed to appear for a status conference on june   at  pm to ensure that discovery is proceeding in a manner

be determined using a formula that compared shaw’s actual costs to a target cost rewarding shaw if it completed the work under the target figure but penalizing it for overruns the turnkey agreement also gave genon the right to audit shaw’s requests for payment on an “open book” basis to substantiate shaw’s costs and expenses turnkey agreement §§   pursuant to a letter agreement dated september   fti a national litigation consulting firm agreed to provide assistance to genon and its outside counsel alston  bird in connection with an audit of shaw and potentially a subsequent lawsuit see ecf no  ex  “retention letter” at  although the retention letter was addressed to both genon and alston  bird it made clear that alston  bird was the entity retaining fti and that genon was a signatory only because it was solely responsible for the payment of fti’s fees id the audit that fti undertook had at least two components first in october and november  fti examined the payroll of shaw’s nonmanual

 of the federal rules of civil procedure that included a request for “all documents comprising or pertaining to any evaluation analysis or assessment or audit of shaw’s costs of performance by genon or its agents including without limitation fti consulting” ecf no  ¶  despite having previously relied on its audit rights under the turnkey agreement as a justification for the payroll audit genon responded by filing a motion to quash the fti subpoena or alternatively for a protective order on the ground that all of the materials sought pursuant to the subpoena constituted work product ecf nos   in its motion genon argued that fti was a nontestifying expert consultant that had been retained in anticipation of litigation ecf no  at  it was only at this stage that shaw learned that fti had been retained by genon’s outside counsel alston  bird rather than by genon see genon i  wl  at  it since has become clear that genon plans to use as expert witnesses in this case two other fti employees neil a gaudion and patrick a mcgeehin genon mem at   exs   according to genon these witnesses were not involved in the  procurement and payroll audits having first been engaged in april  five  attached to the subpoena are certain emails to or from slavis genon argues that these attachments implicitly narrowed the otherwise broad scope of the subpoena genon mem at  in its reply shaw contends that the email chain in fact was attached as a means of identifying the agreement between fti and genon which shaw had not yet obtained in discovery see ecf no  “shaw reply” at  see also ecf no  at  defining the “ftigenon agreement” in part as relating to the work referenced in the attached email correspondence  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  months after the audit overseen by slavis was completed id at  slavis decl ¶  genon further asserts that the testimony that these witnesses will offer focuses on shaw’s work during time periods not covered by the  audits genon mem at  in an opinion and order dated june   district judge harold baer to whom this case is assigned found that fti’s audit paperwork was created to serve the dual purposes of a determining “in the ordinary course of business    what was due and owing” and b assessing “the availability and strength of potential legal claims” genon i  wl  at  in view of these dual purposes judge baer concluded that the fti papers would have been prepared in “essentially similar form” even if this declaratory judgment action had not been filed and thus could not “fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the litigation” id quoting united states v adlman  fd   d cir  emphasis in adlman judge baer consequently denied genon’s motion to quash the subpoena that shaw had served on fti and granted shaw’s crossmotion to compel genon and fti to comply with that subpoena ecf nos   id at  following that ruling genon produced to shaw certain documents in its files relating to the fti audits see genon mem at  additionally fti produced its documents responsive to the subpoena directly to shaw at the same time fti also furnished a copy of its documents to genon id ex  decl of jed m weiss esq dated feb   “weiss decl” ¶   case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  after receiving fti’s production shaw’s counsel sent fti’s outside counsel at cole schotz meisel forman  leonard pa an email inquiring why the “earliest email produced    was march ” since “fti was retained in september ” id ex a in a later email shaw’s counsel noted that he had found certain “missing emails” that were “produced by genon but not by fti” and continued to press for an explanation of the gaps id fti’s counsel’s eventual response was that fti had “produced the responsive emails” that it maintained “in the regular course of its business” id fti’s counsel further noted that if shaw possessed any emails “by andor between fti and alston  bird andor genon” that fti had not produced those were “likely emails that were not maintained by fti in the regular course of business” id genon was not privy to many of the communications between shaw’s counsel and fti’s counsel concerning the scope and adequacy of fti’s production because shaw’s counsel chose to deal directly with fti’s counsel and neither attorney copied genon’s counsel on the emails see id ¶   ex a  shaw subsequently deposed slavis on october   slavis dep   fti’s public website describes slavis as someone with “over  years of experience  when i asked shaw’s counsel mr branca during a recent conference why genon’s counsel was not copied on that email traffic he responded that he had no “current recollection of any reason for that” tr of telephone conf on mar   at   it appears that neither planta nor kaplan who assisted

last visited apr   but his deposition testimony established that he had only limited knowledge of fti’s information management policies during that deposition after slavis testified that it was his practice “not to send emails regarding any of the case ie audit matters” and that he had adhered to that general practice in connection with the shaw audit shaw’s counsel sought to question him about fti’s document retention policies slavis dep  slavis responded that he was “not sure” whether fti had an email retention policy id at  he nevertheless volunteered that he believed that his “email box was cleared out periodically as a matter of function” and that if so the emails of the fti employees who worked with him on the shaw audit “possibly” “may have been destroyed as well” id at  emphasis added when he was asked however whether he knew “as a matter of fact” that any of his own emails had been “destroyed” slavis responded “i don’t know” id at  slavis also indicated that he lacked any knowledge as to whether “anyone at fti had sent any emails in the first five months of fti’s shaw audit engagement” id at  despite slavis’ uncertainty fti in fact has an email retention policy in a declaration in opposition to shaw’s motion lisa crawford “crawford” a managing director in fti’s information technology group states that “fti’s standard email storage procedure involves backingup the entire contents of each person’s microsoft outlook mailbox at the end of each month” genon mem ex  crawford decl dated  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  feb   “crawford decl” ¶  according to crawford the “imaging process includes emails contained in each custodian’s inbox and sent and deleted folders as well as other emails that may have been saved into separate and distinct folders” id these imaged emails then are stored on backup tapes id in responding to the shaw subpoena in  however fti failed to search any backup tapes see weiss decl ¶  in late december  following the conclusion of discovery shaw filed the present motion which does not seek any further discovery instead shaw seeks one of several proposed spoliation sanctions which include in descending order of severity dismissing genon’s complaint precluding fti from offering any expert opinions in the form of testimony or affidavits and requiring the drawing of “an adverse inference against genon and any evidence offered by fti” ecf no  shaw also asks that if the court “has any doubt that spoliation has occurred it    order a forensic analysis of fti’s computer hard drives at genon’s and fti’s sole cost and expense” ecf no  shaw mem in supp of mot for sanctions “shaw mem” at  finally shaw seeks to recover the costs and expenses associated with its motion ecf no  after shaw filed its motion fti attempted

“allison” of korelogic llc an outside consultant retained by fti to verify its efforts to restore slavis’ emails from the backup tapes has provided a more detailed description of fti’s data processing environment and backup protocol which helps explain why the tapes for those six months could not be restored see ecf no  at  attestation of allison sr security consultant for korelogic llc dated feb   as allison observes fti maintains its electronic data on  “netapp” data storage systems that are arrayed as storage area networks “sans” each data storage system in turn is partitioned into a series of logical units identified by logical unit numbers “luns” id at  using emc’s “networker” product fti attempts to back up its files from lun to lun and on a weekly basis from luns to tapes id at  if a networker backup fails the system makes three additional tries before abandoning the backup process at monthend fti selects the backup tape successfully completed closest to the last day of the month as the monthly backup which  allison has more than twentyfive years of experience in the fields of information technology and information technology management id at   case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  then is stored offsite for ten years however if there is no successful backup during a oneweek period on either side of the last day of the month no backup tape for that month is preserved furthermore any weekly backup tapes that have not been selected as monthly backups are retained for only four weeks before being recycled id at  according to allison the process of backing up the luns to tape may fail for a number of reasons including the sheer volume of data being transmitted the fact that the data is being transmitted over a longdistance network and incompatibilities between the size of the lun files and the capacity of the backup tape id at  while the automated backup process consequently is not perfect the primary purpose of backing up fti’s data is of course to facilitate business continuity and disaster recovery not to ensure that the data is preserved for litigation see id at  given these business purposes fti did not require that its backup process have zero defects indeed allison observed that there were sporadic failures in the fti backup system other than the missing six months at issue here id at  in his attestation allison opines that despite the failure to ensure that a monthly backup is stored each month fti’s backup procedures constitute a “reasonable business process that makes a good faith effort to collect and backup all corporate data” id at  after the fourteen available backup tapes were successfully restored fti used a utility to locate slavis’ email repositories and to extract them into a single microsoft personal storage pst file for each tape see id at  fti’s counsel then searched those pst files and other microsoft outlook files on fti’s active drives to  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  locate any additional emails

not responsive to shaw’s subpoena during its earlier review of the data on its custodians’ active drives cazan letter i at   klein letter among the new materials provided by fti were emails relating

only ten had not previously been produced to shaw by genon as part of its own document production after judge baer rejected genon’s work product claim cazan letter i at  of those ten documents two were emails between slavis and a shaw employee of which shaw presumably was aware before fti made its supplemental production another three emails related to a nondisclosure agreement that shaw asked fti to sign before commencing the audit and thus do not pertain directly to the audit itself fti represents that “there is only one email pertaining to the audit that shaw did not already have in its

newtron files were “already in” and could be found under “client filessubcontracts” id although it undertook a detailed further review of its electronic information regarding slavis after the motion was filed fti has not attempted to restore or search any backup tapes relating to planta’s or kaplan’s email to recover additional information that may have been deleted from their active drives as part of its opposition to shaw’s motion however genon has submitted the declarations of planta and kaplan in those declarations planta and kaplan indicate that they responded to shaw’s subpoena by turning over to inhouse counsel “all documents and emails related in any way to their work for genon including emails in their inboxes and sent and deleted folders” planta decl ¶  kaplan decl ¶  planta further represents that he did not purge any substantive emails relating to the genon audit from his deleted folder planta decl ¶  and kaplan states that it is not his general practice to

nonetheless a court should never impose spoliation sanctions of any sort unless there has been a showing – inferential or otherwise – that the movant has suffered prejudice see orbit one commc’ns inc v numerex corp  frd   sdny  “no matter how inadequate a party’s efforts at preservation may be    sanctions are not warranted unless there is proof that some information of significance has actually been lost” id at  “it is difficult to see why even a party who destroys information purposefully or is grossly negligent should be sanctioned where there has been no showing that the information was at least minimally relevant” with these precepts in mind i will turn to the elements of spoliation that shaw must prove to secure the relief it seeks  genon’s responsibility for fti’s alleged misconduct the first element that shaw must establish is that genon had control of the missing evidence and a duty to preserve and produce it residential funding  fd at  shaw advances two arguments in this regard first shaw suggests that genon should be held responsible for any failure on the part of fti to preserve or produce evidence even if genon itself was not at fault because fti was acting as genon’s agent shaw mem at  reply at   second shaw contends that genon had both  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  practical and legal control of fti’s information by virtue of its retention of fti as its audit expert and therefore had an obligation to cause fti to preserve and produce the information shaw mem at  shaw reply at  i will address genon’s duty to preserve before turning to its duty to produce information a duty to preserve shaw’s argument with respect to preservation is that genon should have directed fti to preserve its evidence long before the subpoena was issued because genon reasonably anticipated litigation as early as  by which time i fti was functioning  as its agent and ii genon had legal and practical control over fti’s information shaw mem at  shaw reply at  in trigon insurance company v united states  frd  ed va  the court addressed a similar agency claim in that case the government retained an economics consulting firm to assist it in the defense of a suit brought by a company seeking a refund of federal income taxes that it alleged had been improperly assessed id at  as here the consulting firm ostensibly was hired as a nontestifying expert in addition the government separately retained the president of the consulting firm as one of its testifying experts id at  under the version of rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure then in effect the plaintiff was entitled to all of the testifying  shaw maintains that genon has essentially conceded that its duty to preserve fti’s files arose as early as  by arguing before judge baer – albeit unsuccessfully – that the fti audits constituted work product prepared at the direction of alston  bird in anticipation of litigation shaw mem at  shaw reply at  citing ecf nos     case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  expert’s draft reports in addition to those drafts the plaintiff also sought the production  of any communications among the government’s experts and any documents that the experts had reviewed id at  although certain such materials were produced by the time the government instructed the experts to preserve their files “many of the communications and draft reports had been deleted as a result of the consulting firm’s document retention policy and the individual practices of each of the testifying experts” id at  on these facts the court held that the government had a duty to preserve its experts’ files both by virtue of rule  and because the taxpayer had given the government notice that it wanted the materials the court further concluded that the government could not pass the buck to the consulting firm because it was acting as “the agent of the united states in arranging for the expert testimony to be given in the action on behalf of the united states” id at  among the sanctions that the court imposed was an order that precluded the consulting firm from any further participation in aspects of the case relating to expert testimony and permitted the drawing of an adverse inference at trial with respect to the experts’ testimony and credibility id at   rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure subsequently was amended in  to exempt from discovery any drafts of any expert report or disclosure required under rule a and with certain limited exceptions any communications between a party’s attorney and its expert witnesses see rule  adv comm note to  amendments as the advisory committee observed prior to the amendment of the rule attorneys often would “employ two sets of experts – one for purposes of consultation and another to testify at trial – because disclosure of their collaborative interactions with expert consultants would reveal their most sensitive and confidential cases analyses” id  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  more recently in goodman v praxair services inc  f supp d  d md  a pro se plaintiff sought spoliation sanctions based in part on the defendant’s “failure to issue a litigation hold to its ‘key players’ and thirdparty consultants” id at  emphasis added the case arose out of an alleged agreement that the defendant’s predecessor would pay the plaintiff a  success fee if he was able to secure from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” an exemption from a clean air act regulation under which the defendant’s products would have been classified as “fuel additives” over time rather than relying solely on the plaintiff the predecessor corporation enlisted the services of other consultants including a former epa attorney id at  after the epa relented finding that the defendant’s products were not fuel additives the plaintiff threatened suit because he had not been paid the success fee id at  at some point thereafter the defendant corporation’s chief executive officer ceased deleting her own documents relating to the dispute after conferring with counsel but she did not instruct any of the defendant’s other employees or any of its other consultants to implement a litigation hold id addressing whether the duty to preserve extended to the additional third party consultants retained by the defendant magistrate judge paul w grimm noted that there was fourth circuit authority indicating that even if a party could not preserve because he lacked ownership or control of the potential evidence “he still has an obligation to give the opposing party notice of access to the evidence or of the possible destruction of the evidence if the party anticipates litigation involving that evidence id  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  at  citing silvestri v gen motors corp  frd   th cir   judge grimm further concluded that a party has control over documents when it has the “right authority or practical ability to obtain the documents from a nonparty to the action” id quoting in re ntl sec litig  frd   sdny  peck mag j finding that the defendant had neither legal control over the thirdparty consultants’ documents nor the practical ability to cause them to preserve those documents judge grimm denied the plaintiff’s spoliation motion insofar as it was based on the destruction of such documents id at  shaw argues that genon had both legal and practical control over fti’s information concerning the audit and therefore should have directed fti to take steps to preserve that information shaw reply at  to prevail on this argument it is sufficient for shaw to establish that genon had either the legal right or the practical ability to obtain fti’s materials see in re ntl sec litig  frd at  golden trade srl v lee apparel co  frd   sdny  with respect to the issue of legal control shaw points to the retention letter pursuant to which fti agreed to serve as a consultant to alston  bird in  in this case there obviously was no need for genon to notify shaw that there might be information concerning the audit results in fti’s possession since shaw was fully aware of fti’s auditrelated activities indeed shaw had served fti with a subpoena seeking those materials many months before it brought its spoliation motion against genon  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  connection with alston  bird’s representation of genon insofar as relevant the retention letter provides that it is agreed that fti materials and all other working papers and other documents prepared by fti pursuant to this engagement will be maintained as confidential materials and will not be disclosed to third parties without counsel’s consent except as may be required by law regulation or judicial or administrative process unless prohibited by law fti agrees to notify counsel promptly of any of the following events a a request by anyone to examine inspect or copy such documents or records or b any attempt to serve or the actual service of any court order subpoena or summons upon fti that requires the production of such documents or records it is further understood that all opinions and work product of fti shared with counsel or the client shall be maintained as confidential and shall not be shared with any other person or entity retention letter at  contrary to shaw’s contentions the fact that fti agreed to treat its audit work product as confidential and to provide alston  bird with advance notice of subpoenas such as the one served by shaw does not establish that genon was granted any legal rights with respect to fti’s information regarding its audit of shaw moreover the provisions relating to the confidentiality of fti’s audit materials do not indicate that fti had an affirmative duty to furnish those materials to genon at its request or that of alston  bird shaw therefore has failed to establish that genon had legal control over fti’s auditrelated information the issue of practical control presents a closer question although there is no direct evidence that genon could have obtained fti’s auditrelated materials merely by asking for them or that fti necessarily would have honored a request by genon that  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  they be preserved common sense suggests that this is likely fti had not simply performed a single discrete assignment for genon quite to the contrary fti had been engaged to review shaw’s craft payroll and conduct a twopronged audit and it subsequently also agreed to provide expert testimony on genon’s behalf at trial the relationship between fti and genonalston  bird therefore was and remains ongoing moreover fti holds itself out as an entity that is knowledgeable about litigation in light of fti’s continuing relationship with genon and its role as a litigation consultant there seems to be little doubt that fti would have complied with a timely request by genon to preserve its information i therefore conclude at least for present purposes that shaw has met its burden of establishing that fti’s materials related to the audit were within genon’s practical control it follows that genon had a duty to ensure that those materials were adequately preserved see the sedona conference commentary on  legal holds the trigger and the process reprinted in  sedona conf j    guideline  available at httpsthesedonaconferenceorgsystemfilessites sedonacivicactionsnetfilesprivatedrupalfilesyspublicationslegalholdssept  because i have concluded that genon was under a duty to preserve based on its practical control over audit material in fti’s possession i need not determine whether an agency relationship existed between genon and fti  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  pdf “the duty to preserve involves reasonable and good faith efforts taken as soon as is practicable and applied proportionately to identify and as necessary notify persons likely to have relevant information to preserve the information”  b duty to produce turning to genon’s production obligations it is settled law that a party must produce not only all documents in its possession but also all documents within its practical control see shcherbakovskiy v da capo al fine ltd  fd   d cir   “if a party has access and the practical ability to possess documents not available to the party seeking them production may be required” accordingly in ordinary circumstances genon’s discovery obligations may well have required it to take the extra step of securing any additional documents responsive to shaw’s document requests directly from fti which was continuing to serve as genon’s litigation consultant and to produce them in this case however shaw had subpoenaed fti for its documents ecf no  moreover after judge baer granted shaw’s motion to compel shaw’s counsel sent genon’s counsel an email stating that it expected genon to produce immediately “all ftirelated documents dating back to september ” “whether they were in the custody of genon or alston  bird” significantly shaw’s counsel did not ask genon  as the commentary to guideline  cautions “some sources of information under the control of third parties may also be deemed to be within the control of the organization because of contractual or other relationships    with respect to those sources the organization should consider providing appropriate notice concerning the need to preserve material that is likely to be relevant id  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  to produce any documents that were then held by fti stating instead that “shaw will be contacting fti directly to enforce the subpoena” see cazan letter ii attaching email dated june   from mr branca to ms cazan and others consistent with this representation shaw’s counsel soon began communicating directly with fti’s counsel concerning perceived deficiencies in fti’s production without copying genon’s counsel on his emails see weiss decl ex a having negotiated directly with fti concerning its subpoena and having chosen to exclude genon from many of those discussions shaw cannot reasonably complain that genon withheld any fti documents that should have been produced see shcherbakovskiy  fd at  “it is fairly obvious that a party also need not seek such documents from third parties if compulsory process against the third parties is available to the party seeking the documents” indeed the record establishes that genon’s own document production included many of the documents that fti failed to produce in response to the subpoena the court therefore concludes that genon had an obligation to cause fti to preserve its information but is not liable for any unrelated shortcomings in fti’s actual production to shaw  genon’s degree of culpability the next question the court must consider is whether genon acted with a culpable state of mind ie at least negligently by failing to cause fti to preserve its information  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  in prior submissions to this court genon flatly declared that it “first anticipated litigation with shaw in january ” ecf no  at  as genon explained the parties initial dispute was resolved on june   but only seven days later genon “requested assistance from alston  bird” id at  although the scope of alston  bird’s engagement subsequently varied over time genon conceded in its prior papers that it “began to anticipate elements of this very litigation in mid” id at  if so genon’s duty to preserve unquestionably arose at that time in re terrorist bombings of us embassies in e africa  fd   d cir  “the obligation to preserve evidence arises when the party has notice that the evidence is relevant to litigation or when a party should have known that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation” quoting fujitsu ltd v fed express corp  fd   d cir  see also allstate ins co v hamilton beachproctor silex inc  fd   d cir  “spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence or failure to preserve property for another’s use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation” quoting west v goodyear tire  rubber co  fd   d cir  internal quotation marks omitted despite that duty shaw indicates and genon apparently does not dispute that genon failed to issue a litigation hold letter until may  shaw mem at  n there also is no indication that genon ever instructed fti to preserve its material  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  in pension committee of the university of montreal pension plan v banc of america securities llc  f supp d  sdny  judge scheindlin suggested that after the duty to preserve has attached it is gross negligence not to issue a written litigation hold to identify all of the key players and to ensure that their electronic and paper records are preserved to cease the deletion of email or to preserve the records of former employees that are in a party’s possession custody or control and to preserve backup tapes when they are the sole source of relevant information or when they relate to key players if the relevant information maintained by those players is not obtainable from readily accessible sources id at  emphasis added here at least two of the oversights characterized by judge scheindlin as gross negligence arguably occurred after genon contemplated litigation since genon did not cause fti to issue a litigation hold letter to its personnel and did not take steps to ensure that slavis’ records were preserved nonetheless the particular circumstances of this case suggest that a categorical designation of genon’s omissions as gross negligence may not be warranted at the outset genon and its counsel may reasonably have expected that fti which advertises itself as a firm with litigation consulting expertise see branca decl ex f would be aware of the rules governing a party’s discovery conduct and take steps to ensure that it did not cause genon to run afoul of them genon and its counsel also may have believed – mistakenly as it turns out – that slavis and his audit assistants were not “key players” because fti had been retained by alston  bird to serve as a nontestifying expert finally whatever genon’s shortcomings with respect to fti’s information may have been there is no suggestion  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  that genon failed to preserve and produce all of its own documents many of which came from fti i note these mitigating factors principally because certain courts have questioned the brightline culpability rules that judge scheindlin promulgated in pension committee see surowiec v capital title agency inc  f supp d   d ariz  “the court disagrees with pension committee’s holding that a failure to issue a litigation hold constitutes gross negligence per se” haynes v dart no  c   wl  at  nd ill jan   “the failure to institute a document retention policy in the form of a litigation hold is relevant to the court’s consideration but it is not per se evidence of sanctionable conduct” see also orbit one commc’ns  frd at  failure to abide by contemporary preservation standards described in pension committee does not necessarily constitute negligence “depending upon the circumstances of an individual case” nevertheless even if genon’s actions or failures to act do not rise to the level gross negligence its conceded failure to take any steps beyond fti’s general backup procedures to ensure that slavis’ emails were preserved even after litigation was anticipated plainly constitutes negligence see toussie v cnty of suffolk no cv  js arl  wl  at  edny dec   shaw therefore has

have been favorable to shaw see residential funding  fd at  on the other hand if genon merely was ordinarily negligent in carrying out its preservation obligations that presumption would not apply see zubulake v ubs warburg llc  frd   sdny  in the absence of sufficiently egregious conduct the party seeking sanctions must “demonstrate that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the missing evidence would support its claims” great n ins co v power cooling inc no cv erk kam  wl  at  edny sept   where evidence was destroyed as a result of ordinary negligence “there must be extrinsic evidence to demonstrate that the destroyed evidence was relevant and would have been unfavorable to the destroying party” in an effort to establish that relevant evidence is missing and that shaw consequently has been prejudiced shaw points to slavis’ deposition testimony as well as the fact that fti failed to produce any emails from backup tapes for many of the months  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  for which fti attempted to recover data shaw mem at  ecf no  letter to the court from mr branca dated mar   “branca letter” at  neither of these alleged bases for an award of sanctions withstands scrutiny as noted previously shaw alleges that slavis confirmed during his deposition that “fti communicated using emails and that he did not have all of the e mails during the time period of his audit work” shaw mem at  citing slavis dep   slavis actually testified however that he generally did not engage in substantive communications by email with respect to the genon audit or other audits slavis dep  moreover although slavis believed that his email box was “cleared out periodically as a matter of function” he conceded that he lacked any firsthand knowledge as to whether that was so  id at  slavis’ conjecture that the emails on fti’s active drives may have been periodically deleted by fti’s systems managers consequently does not constitute proof that this actually occurred indeed despite the lengthy submissions that both sides have made in this case the record appears to be totally silent as to whether any emails on the active drives of fti’s custodians were periodically deleted when they reached a certain age  the court cannot assume that this in its papers shaw suggests that slavis’ testimony that he was unaware of fti’s document retention policy should be considered “suspect” since fti advertises itself as a litigation consultant shaw mem at  the fact that slavis may be knowledgeable about construction auditing however scarcely means that slavis’ testimony was fabricated   as shaw itself concedes in its reply papers one of the questions that remains unanswered even at this stage is “were email boxes routinely purged before or after the monthly backup” reply mem at   case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  is so merely because such automatic deletion protocols may be commonplace in large institutions  to be sure there is evidence that  emails and one calendar request were found on the fourteen restored slavis backup tapes but nowhere else among fti’s active data sources as shaw correctly observes this means that these items must have been “double deleted” that is intentionally removed by slavis from both his inbox and his deleted folder see branca letter at  all but ten of those emails however were produced to shaw by genon during the course of discovery since shaw received these emails the mere fact that they were not produced from slavis’ active files obviously could not have prejudiced shaw shaw also argues that it has been prejudiced because there were no monthly backup tapes of slavis’ email activity for six of the months that fti attempted to restore and consequently there is no way to know whether shaw has been deprived of relevant evidence slavis however was not in a position to know which of his doubledeleted emails fti’s technicians would be able to restore since seventy percent of the potentially relevant tapes have been restored they provide a reasonable basis for determining whether there is in fact reason to believe that relevant information was destroyed  for example in fiscal year  the united states courts had more than  employees see admin office of the us courts the judiciary fair employment practices annual report  fiscal year  nonetheless despite the scale of the enterprise my emails remain on my active drive without any time limitations unless i take affirmative steps to delete them  case cvhbfm document  filed  page  of  having reviewed each of the  emails restored from the backup tapes my conclusion is that shaw’s characterization of them as going to “the heart of this case” is vastly overblown indeed if anything the emails confirm slavis’ assertion that he did not use email to engage in substantive communications about the audit many of the emails thus deal with administrative minutiae such as arranging internet access for visiting fti personnel at genon’s facilities ensuring the prompt receipt of a confidentiality agreement that shaw had asked fti to sign prior to commencing its audit problems synchronizing various custodians’ microsoft outlook calendars and confirming the locations on fti’s databases where various shaw documents and files could be found the limited probative value of the “double deleted” documents is even more persuasively demonstrated by those that shaw chose to highlight after genon identified which of the documents comprising fti’s further production had not been retrieved from fti’s active data

district court southern district of new york x genon midatlantic llc  genon  chalk point llc   plaintiffs    against   stone  webster inc   defendant  x hon harold baer jr district judge  cv  hb opinion  order before the court is a brief in support of a claim of privilege made by defendant stone and webster inc  shaw  as to document no shaw e  document  the brief was provided after i requested more detailed briefing following a letter motion made by plaintiffs genon midatlantic llc and genon chalk point llc collectively genon  on october   asking that i find that the document was not privileged and could be introduced at certain depositions for the reasons set forth below i find that the document is privileged work product and genon s letter motion is consequently denied i background because a more extensive review of the background of this case is available in my opinion of june   genon midatlantic llc v stone  webster inc genon i  civ   wl  at  sdny june   and an extensive recent opinion issued by magistrate judge frank maas on the status of various privilege claims made as to other disputed documents genon midatlantic llc v stone  webster inc genon ii no  civ   wl  at  sdny nov   a short summary of this action will suffice to comply with the passage of a  maryland environmental law genon undertook the upgrade of the air quality control systems at three of its power plants genon i  wl  at  under the turnkey agreement dated july   shaw was to design and build these improved air quality control systems id compensation under the contract was not fixed but would be determined by applying a formula containing two variables  the target cost set out in the contract and  the total amount of reimbursable costs incurred by the  those depositions have already taken place shaw was given a choice between allowing the document to be introduced at the depositions and objecting on privilege grounds or precluding the document at the depositions but filing more complete briefing shaw elected option  and the additional briefs are now before the court  contractor to complete the work or the actual costs id the target cost was also subject to modification by change order  genon brought this declaratory judgment action claiming that it does not have to pay shaw for some of the work performed above the contract amounts after cost overruns for the project were projected to exceed  million id the document in dispute consists of financial spreadsheets and illustrations graphing the calculations contained in the spreadsheets the spreadsheet originally created in  shows the combination of charges and change orders that would maximize defendant shaw s profits on the project based on the elaborate compensation formulas provided for under the turnkey agreement the document is not addressed to anyone and does not have any privilege markings ii legal standard workproduct privilege established by hickman v taylor  us   and codified in frcp ba precludes discovery of documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative including the other party s attorney consultant surety indemnitor insurer or agent frcp ba the privilege applies to documents prepared because of litigation united states v adlman  fd   d cir  there is a heavy burden on the party claiming workproduct protection in re grand jury subpoenas dated march   and august    fd   d cir  documents prepared in the ordinary course of business or that otherwise would have been prepared absent the prospect of litigation do not receive work product protection gucci am inc v guess inc  frd   sdny  at the same time a document prepared because of the prospect of litigation does not lose its workproduct protection merely because it may assist in business decisions adlman  fd at   we hold that a document created because of anticipated litigation which tends to reveal mental impressions conclusions opinions or theories concerning the litigation does not lose workproduct protection merely because it is intended to assist in the making of a business decision influenced by the likely outcome of the anticipated litigation  if a document is work product the privilege applies unless the party opposing the privilege can demonstrate substantial need for the document id at   change orders are added to or deleted from the original scope of work of a contract which alter the original contract amount or completion date of the project a change order could stem from a legitimate previously unknown obstacle to a project or from a contractor s addition of fees and work items through change orders once they have obtained the contract an exploitive tactic  iii discussion shaw asserts that the disputed document is privileged work product which was created in preparation for the mediation between genon and shaw scheduled for march   shaw s brief  the document has a creation date of  because it was based off a document created earlier by genon s sourcing manager priya gill  gill  shaw s brief ex  ferguson decl ¶  in january or february  michael a branca outside counsel for shaw requested stone  webster inc to create scenarios showing how the compensation factors in section  of the contract would operate under various potential outcomes of the various disputed costs and change orders id at ¶  peter ferguson  ferguson  shaw s project director forwarded the document to greg hill and mark monahan to develop these compensation scenarios under relevant articles of the parties contract id at ¶  to assist in illustrating how the compensation formulas worked as guidance for mr branca at the mediation shaw s brief  shaw has submitted a declaration in support of these assertions from ferguson which avers that document no shaw e was created solely as the result of mr branca s request as passed on by me to messrs hill and monahan stone  webster had not previously created such scenarios ferguson decl ¶  genon asserts that this document was created in the ordinary course of business genon reply  according to genon shaw and genon have both created similar compensation scenarios throughout their business relationship as evidenced for example by the fact that the original spreadsheets that the document was based off of came from gill id at  further genon asserts that the purpose of this document was for shaw to determine how to maximize its profits as demonstrated by shaw s alteration of its change order and accounting assertions after updating the spreadsheet in february  such that by june  shaw claimed it was entitled to change orders placing it near the peak compensation zone identified in the february  calculations id at  based on the explanation presented by shaw including the sworn declaration of ferguson this document is protected work product the document would not have been created in the same form irrespective of the litigation but rather was created specifically in preparation for mediation adlman  fd at    where a document was created because of anticipated litigation and would not have been prepared in substantially similar form but for the prospect of that litigation it falls within rule b  the protection of rule b is not limited exclusively to materials prepared to assist at trial id at  the text of rule b does not limit its protection to materials prepared to assist at trial to the contrary the text of the  rule clearly sweeps more broadly it expressly states that workproduct privilege applies not only to documents prepared    for trial but also to those prepared in anticipation of litigation  quoting frcp ba even if as genon argues the document was used by shaw to determine what levels of change orders and charges to assert against genon because the document was prepared because of litigation to assist with an upcoming mediation the workproduct privilege applies adlman  fd at  finding that a document prepared because of litigation does not lose its workproduct protection merely because it may be used to assist in business decisions shaw has met its heavy burden in re grand jury subpoenas  fd at  of demonstrating that this document would not have been prepared in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation adlman  fd at  genon has not presented evidence of a substantial need for the document to overcome the privilege id at  genon makes two additional arguments relying on the earlier decisions by judge maas and myself addressing various assertions of privilege both arguments fail first genon asserts that the situation addressed by my decision on june   was very similar genon brief  there i found that documents created in connection with genon s thirdparty audit of shaw s accounting information were not entitled to workproduct protection explaining that the documents served a dual purpose of fulfilling a contractual right in the ordinary course of business and also assessing the availability and strength of potential legal claims genon i  wl  at  that situation however is clearly distinguishable those documents were created because of the provision in the turnkey agreement for such audits this document on the other hand was created because of a lawyer s request to help him prepare for mediation second genon has suggested to shaw that judge maas s recent privilege ruling resolves this issue to the extent that genon believes this to be the case i agree with shaw that judge maas has simply not reached the issue because it was not before him first judge maas did not consider document e genon ii  wl  further the similar documents addressed by judge maas were financial reporting and other accounting documents withheld by shaw on the grounds of attorneyclient privilege not workproduct doctrine genon ii  wl  at  in fact judge maas specifically recognized that the workproduct  on november   we received an additional letter from shaw which indicates that genon has suggested that judge maas addressed documents similar to the e and has resolved the issue of privilege with respect to this document letter from shaw nov   i reach this argument here by way of completeness it does not appear in genon s brief  doctrine was not an argument before him and noted that his decision might be different were shaw arguing mat the documents were protected work product wllle at least some of these documents could conceivably constitute work product shaw failed to rely on the work product doctrine with respect to them in its privilege log accordingly any work product protection that shaw might have been entitled to assert has been waived fd at  n conclusion for the foregoing reasons genons letter motion to find document e not privileged is denied soorde deember  new york new york usdj  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news google news archive yahoo news find a lawyer
