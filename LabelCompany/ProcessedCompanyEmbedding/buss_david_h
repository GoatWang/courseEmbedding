school when he was  he worked a hour graveyard shift at a truck stop in new jersey pumping gas and bumping tires after he was threatened by a truck driver buss decided to go back to school and earned his high school diploma by taking night classes in spite of insufficient grades buss entered the university of texas at austin by drawing a lucky number in a trial lottery system buss excelled for the first time in academics while pursuing creative fiction classical flute and tennis while he was there he developed a powerful interest in psychology which was nurtured by several teachers one in particular ken craik started a very exciting intellectual exchange that culminated in a decade long research collaboration and friendship together they developed the act frequency approach to personality which focuses on understanding dispositional regularities in humans everyday lives buss has had an active teaching and research career after completing his ph d in  he accepted a position as assistant professor at harvard university this was a fertile intellectual environment for buss while he was here he developed an active research program and returned to his love of evolutionary psychology a group of harvard students favored buss and spent a sizable portion of their harvard days and nights working on busss research he was promoted by harvard to associate professor but decided to leave and join the psychology department as associate professor and the research center for group dynamics as faculty associate at the university of michigan in  while he was at the university of michigan he got the chance to develop his interest in evolutionary psychology buss was elected to be a fellow at the center of advanced studies in the behavioral sciences in  in  he left the university of michigan and began teaching psychology at the university of texas in austin his research focuses on such aspects of the human personality as sexuality and its relationship to sexual selection as presented in darwins human evolution theory for example buss looks at mate selection in humans and the methods that humans use to end an unproductive relationship he has been active on many different boards and directorships having served on the board of directors for the international society for the study of individual differences   the executive council for human behavior and evolution society  director of the international consortium of social and personality psychologists present only to name a few throughout his career buss has received many awards and honors he won the hoopes prize for supervising awardwinning summa cum laude honors thesis at harvard university in  in  he won the a p a distinguished scientific award for early career contribution to psychology in  buss won the distinguished faculty recognition award from the university of michigan and the g stanley hall award by the american psychological association in  some of his honors include being placed in the whos who in american education keynote speaker for several different events and a lecturer for the louis clark vanuxem at princeton university in march of  buss is highly respected for his study of human mating strategies by the scientific community but his interpretations are controversial and often challenge the dominant beliefs in society in fact he has been threatened several times for his interpretations theory dr david buss applies the modern evolutionary theory to explaining human behavior considering the evolution of jealousy he notes that jealousy is a powerful emotion that often attends longterm romantic and sexual relationships and concludes that it is the emotion that is closely linked with spousal abuse and homicide jealousy is often viewed as a sign of immaturity and insecurity but may in fact represent a profoundly adaptive solution to the problems posed by real threats to a relationship he explored sex differences in jealousy and the role of jealousy in sexual and romantic relationships in evolutionary terms busss the evolution of desire  portrays humans as remarkably similar to their ancestors in that they employ a set of hardheaded strategies designed to obtain the best mate possible even if it means ruthlessly dumping a partner he found that men andwomen seek out the mates who best suit their reproductive needs women look for men ho will commit to longterm relationships and men seek women who appear best able to conceive and give birth to healthy and strong offspring he also described ways that humans end relationships that are unproductive throughout time evolutionary psychology has emerged as a new theoretical perspective and seeks to synthesize the guiding principles of modern evolutionary theory with current formulations of psychological phenomena the central concepts are adaptation and natural selection the evolutionary concepts of natural selection and adaptation have been increasingly incorporated in the areas of cognitive developmental social personality and clinical psychology there is much confusion about these central concepts but they can be traced back to several factors foremost psychologists typically receive no formal training in evolutionary biology and the psychological mechanisms to examine this theory are new and with the newness comes confusion with many false starts psychologist dating back to darwins time have had a wariness about evolutionary approaches and finally that there are genuine differences in scientific opinion about which concepts should be used what the concepts actually mean and how they should be applied evolution is the changes over time in organic structure it was hypothesized long before darwin but he supplied the causal mechanism in the form of natural selection that had long since been missing darwin wanted not only to explain why lifeforms have the characteristics they do and why these characteristics change over time but also to account for the particular ways in which they change his answer to all of these questions of life was his theory of natural selection the theory of natural selection has three essential components variation inheritance and selection these provide the raw materials for evolution it was found that only a few of these variations are passed down from parents to offspring and that only those characteristics that are inherited play a role in the evolutionary process selection was the third important criteria in his theory those who were desirable produce more offspring while those who were not produced very few if any offspring in order for an organism to pass on their traits they must reproduce the criteria for reproduction is survival therefore it took on a critical role in darwins theory of natural selection he envisioned two classes of evolved variantssurvivors and reproductive competitors the natural selection theory unified all living creatures today the evolutionary process of natural selection has been refined in the form of inclusive fitness theory hamilton discussed the measure of an individuals direct reproductive success in passing on genes through the production of offspring as classical fitness but this was too narrow to take into account the effects of evolution by selection he proposed that organisms genes could be passed on regardless of whether the organism directly reproduced offspring this implied that the parental care is merely a special case of caring for kin who carry copies of ones genes in their bodies this was how classical fitness was expanded to inclusive fitness inclusive fitness is not a property of an individual organism but rather a property of its actions or effects it can be calculated from an individuals own reproductive success plus the effects the individuals actions have on the reproductive success of his or her genetic relatives in psychological sex differences origins through sexual selection march buss states that evolutionary psychology predicts that males and females will be similar in all the domains in which the sexes have faced the same or similar adaptive problems when men and women face substantially different adaptive problems in some domains throughout the evolutionary history of humans they develop different adaptive structures or behaviors therefore women have developed particular adaptations that men do not have some of these adaptations are a cervix that dilates mechanisms for producing labor contractions and the release of oxytocin in the blood stream during childbirth there are different informationprocessing problems faced by men and women in some adaptive domains men have faced the problem of uncertainty of paternity inputative offspring this has been a problem throughout time and has led men to behave in ways that increased their likelihood of paternity and decreased the odds of investing in children who were putatively theirs but whose genetic fathers where other men while men faced this problem women have faced the problem of securing a reliable or replenishable supply of resources to carry them through pregnancy and lactation especially when food was scarce for this reason women prefer mates who showed the ability to accrue resources and the willingness to provide them for particular women buss states that from an evolutionary psychological perspective there are several key questions about sex differences these questions are a in what domains have women and men faced different adaptive problems b what are the sexdifferentiated psychological mechanisms of women and men that have evolved in response to these sexdifferentiated adaptive problems c which social cultural and contextual inputs oderate the magnitude of expressed sex differences most people equate evolution with natural selection or survival selection darwin believed there to be a second theory of evolution the theory of sexual selection acording to darwin sexual selection is the causal process of the evolution of characteristics on the basis of reproductive advantage as opposed tosurvival advantages there are two forms of sexual selection the first is where members of one sex can successfully outcompete members of their own sex in a process of intrasexual competition the second in where members of one sex can evolve preferences for desirable qualities in potential mates through the process of intersexual selection for humans both causal processes preferential mate choice and samesex competition for access to mates are prevalent among both sexes and probably has been throughout human evolutionary history there are strong sex differences that occur reliably in domains closely linked with sex and mating the psychological sex differences are patterned in a manner that maps precisely onto the adaptive problems men and women have faced over human evolutionary history evolutionary psychology perspectives also offer several insights into the broader discourse on sex differences it shows that neither women nor men can be considered superior or inferior to the other although it found that sex differences originated through a causal process of sexual selection it does not imply that the differences are unchangeable or intractable third it is difficult to believe that attempts to change the status quo would be very effective if they are undertaken in ignorance of sex differences that truly exist in this case and many others knowledge is power this theory of sex differences has been capable of predicting and explaining a large number of precise detailed patterned sex differences discovered by research guided by evolutionary psychology it offers a heuristic tool to guide investigators to the particular domains in which the most pronounced sex differences and similarities will be found one of busss studies examined mate retention tactics in married couples he studied  individuals divided equally among men and women all of the participants had been married for less than a year the participants engaged in three separate episodes of assessment first a confidential biographical questionnaire cataloged selfreport of acts of mate retention and a measure designed to assess tactics next the participants were evaluated in a laboratory session independent of their partners during this session each participant reported their perceptions of their partners physical attractiveness and completed a measure of suspected future infidelity of their partner finally the couples were interviewed to provide independent assessments of physical attractiveness they found that the couples were in their mids on average and the average background ses was middle class they looked at  mate retention tactics and how well men and women performed these tactics  of the husbands and  of the wives reported never performing an act of violence against a rival with the remaining  tactics approximately  of husbands and wives reported some nonzero level of performance of the relevant component acts men reported a significantly higher use of resource display as well as a significantly greater use of submission debasement and intrasexual threats women reported a greater use of verbal possession signals and punishment of mates infidelity threat they looked at mate retention as a function of partners age and found that men married to younger women reported devoting greater effort to the adaptive problem of mate retention including greater partner concealment emotional manipulation commitment manipulation verbal signals of possession possessive ornamentation intrasexual threats and violence against rival men the potential confound in this study in the fact that the relationships where so young and that mens mate retention is a function of the length of the relationship and relaxes as the couple become more secure in their relationship another confound was the age of the man it is thought that perhaps younger men are more insecure about holding on to their partners the only confound that held was that the length of relationship positively covaried with mens reported use of jealousy induction in conclusion mens mate retention efforts were liked clearly with the youth and therefore the reproductive value of their spouses womens mate retention was linked with their own age with younger women guarding their partners more intensely than older women mate retention as afunction of perceived attractiveness was significant for males men married women who they perceived to be physically attractive and reported a greater resource display appearance enhancement verbal signals of possession and intrasexual threats than did men who married women they perceived to be less physically attractive whereas women who married men who they perceived to be physically attractive devoted less effort to mate retention than women who perceived their husbands to be less attractive women who married men they thought attractive reported less use of jealousy induction punishing their partners threats to be unfaithful sexual inducements and husband derogation the results of this study provide strong support for the general hypothesis that the sexes differ not merely in the tactics used to keep a mate but also in the variables that affect the intensity of mate retention efforts men exhibit resource display as a mate retention tactic while women were more likely to use appearance enhancements to retain a mate men reported greater use of submission and debasement and intrasexual threats as mate retention tactics while women used more verbal possession signals and were more punishing of their partners infidelity threats also men were more likely than women to justify their extramarital sex and experience less guilt when they engaged in it mens mate retention tactics are clearly linked with youth and perceived physical attractiveness of their wife while womens mate retention tactics are linked with the effort their spouse allocated to status striving finally it was noted that particular forms of mate retention may be early indictors of the physical abuse of wives it was found that many had high levels of mate concealment vigilance and derogation of mate time line  born april  in indianapolis  bachelor of art at the university of texas  ph d from berkeley    instructor of psychology at harvard university

inherited play a role in the evolutionary process selection was the third important criteria in his theory those who were desirable produce more offspring while those who were not produced very few if any offspring in order for an organism to pass on their traits they must reproduce the criteria for reproduction is survival therefore it took on a critical role in darwins theory of natural selection he envisioned two classes of evolved variantssurvivors and reproductive competitors the natural selection theory unified all living creatures today the evolutionary process of natural selection has been refined in the form of inclusive fitness theory hamilton discussed the measure of an individuals direct reproductive success in passing on genes through the production of offspring as classical fitness but this was too narrow to take into account the effects of evolution by selection he proposed that organisms genes could be passed on regardless of whether the organism directly reproduced offspring this implied that the parental care is merely a special case of caring for kin who carry copies of ones genes in their bodies this was how classical fitness was expanded to inclusive fitness inclusive fitness is not a property of an individual organism but rather a property of its actions or effects it can be calculated from an individuals own reproductive success plus the effects the individuals actions have on the reproductive success of his or her genetic relatives in psychological sex differences origins through sexual selection march buss states that evolutionary psychology predicts that males and females will be similar in all the domains in which the sexes have faced the same or similar adaptive problems when men and women face substantially different adaptive problems in some domains throughout the evolutionary history of humans they develop different adaptive structures or behaviors therefore women have developed particular adaptations that men do not have some of these adaptations are a cervix that dilates mechanisms for producing labor contractions and the release of oxytocin in the blood stream during childbirth there are different informationprocessing problems faced by men and women in some adaptive domains men have faced the problem of uncertainty of paternity inputative offspring this has been a problem throughout time and has led men to behave in ways that increased their likelihood of paternity and decreased the odds of investing in children who were putatively theirs but whose genetic fathers where other men while men faced this problem women have faced the problem of securing a reliable or replenishable supply of resources to carry them through pregnancy and lactation especially when food was scarce for this reason women prefer mates who showed the ability to accrue resources and the willingness to provide them for particular women buss states that from an evolutionary psychological perspective there are several key questions about sex differences these questions are a in what domains have women and men faced different adaptive problems b what are the sexdifferentiated psychological mechanisms of women and men that have evolved in response to these sexdifferentiated adaptive problems c which social cultural and contextual inputs oderate the magnitude of expressed sex differences most people equate evolution with natural selection or survival selection darwin believed there to be a second theory of evolution the theory of sexual selection acording to darwin sexual selection is the causal process of the evolution of characteristics on the basis of reproductive advantage as opposed tosurvival advantages there are two forms of sexual selection the first is where members of one sex can successfully outcompete members of their own sex in a process of intrasexual competition the second in where members of one sex can evolve preferences for desirable qualities in potential mates through the process of intersexual selection for humans both causal processes preferential mate choice and samesex competition for access to mates are prevalent among both sexes and probably has been throughout human evolutionary history there are strong sex differences that occur reliably in domains closely linked with sex and mating the psychological sex differences are patterned in a manner that maps precisely onto the adaptive problems men and women have faced over human evolutionary history evolutionary psychology perspectives also offer several insights into the broader discourse on sex differences it shows that neither women nor men can be considered superior or inferior to the other although it found that sex differences originated through a causal process of sexual selection it does not imply that the differences are unchangeable or intractable third it is difficult to believe that attempts to change the status quo would be very effective if they are undertaken in ignorance of sex differences that truly exist in this case and many others knowledge is power this theory of sex differences has been capable of predicting and explaining a large number of precise detailed patterned sex differences discovered by research guided by evolutionary psychology it offers a heuristic tool to guide investigators to the particular domains in which the most pronounced sex differences and similarities will be found one of busss studies examined mate retention tactics in married couples he studied  individuals divided equally among men and women all of the participants had been married for less than a year the participants engaged in three separate episodes of assessment first a confidential biographical questionnaire cataloged selfreport of acts of mate retention and a measure designed to assess tactics next the participants were evaluated in a laboratory session independent of their partners during this session each participant reported their perceptions of their partners physical attractiveness and completed a measure of suspected future infidelity of their partner finally the couples were interviewed to provide independent assessments of physical attractiveness they found that the couples were in their mids on average and the average background ses was middle class they looked at  mate retention tactics and how well men and women performed these tactics  of the husbands and  of the wives reported never performing an act of violence against a rival with the remaining  tactics approximately  of husbands and wives reported some nonzero level of performance of the relevant component acts men reported a significantly higher use of resource display as well as a significantly greater use of submission debasement and intrasexual threats women reported a greater use of verbal possession signals and punishment of mates infidelity threat they looked at mate retention as a function of partners age and found that men married to younger women reported devoting greater effort to the adaptive problem of mate retention including greater partner concealment emotional manipulation commitment manipulation verbal signals of possession possessive ornamentation intrasexual threats and violence against rival men the potential confound in this study in the fact that the relationships where so young and that mens mate retention is a function of the length of the relationship and relaxes as the couple become more secure in their relationship another confound was the age of the man it is thought that perhaps younger men are more insecure about holding on to their partners the only confound that held was that the length of relationship positively covaried with mens reported use of jealousy induction in conclusion mens mate retention efforts were liked clearly with the youth and therefore the reproductive value of their spouses womens mate retention was linked with their own age with younger women guarding their partners more intensely than older women mate retention as afunction of perceived attractiveness was significant for males men married women who they perceived to be physically attractive and reported a greater resource display appearance enhancement verbal signals of possession and intrasexual threats than did men who married women they perceived to be less physically attractive whereas women who married men who they perceived to be physically attractive devoted less effort to mate retention than women who perceived their husbands to be less attractive women who married men they thought attractive reported less use of jealousy induction punishing their partners threats to be unfaithful sexual inducements and husband derogation the results of this study provide strong support for the general hypothesis that the sexes differ not merely in the tactics used to keep a mate but also in the variables that affect the intensity of mate retention efforts men exhibit resource display as a mate retention tactic while women were more likely to use appearance enhancements to retain a mate men reported greater use of submission and debasement and intrasexual threats as mate retention tactics while women used more verbal possession signals and were more punishing of their partners infidelity threats also men were more likely than women to justify their extramarital sex and experience less guilt when they engaged in it mens mate retention tactics are clearly linked with youth and perceived physical attractiveness of their wife while womens mate retention tactics are linked with the effort their spouse allocated to status striving finally it was noted that particular forms of mate retention may be early indictors of the physical abuse of wives it was found that many had high levels of mate concealment vigilance and derogation of mate time line  born april  in indianapolis  bachelor of art at the university of texas  ph d from berkeley    instructor of psychology at harvard university
