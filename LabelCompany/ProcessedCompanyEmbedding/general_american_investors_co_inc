issues management team board of directors  years of fundamental security analysis general american investors company inc is one of the nation’s oldest closedend funds for  years we have internally managed a global portfolio of investments consisting principally of common stocks of u s companies but also including international and private securities as a closedend fund shares of our common stock are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange thus our asset base is not as subject to wide fluctuations due to shifts in investor sentiment as is the asset base of an openend mutual fund this stability has enabled us to diligently pursue our longterm analytical approach and we believe has contributed to our superior longterm investment results over the  years ended december   the
