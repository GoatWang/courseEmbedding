discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is managements discussion and analysis of the first of long island corporations financial condition and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements the corporations financial condition and operating results principally reflect those of its whollyowned subsidiary the first national bank of long island and subsidiaries whollyowned by the bank either directly or indirectly fny service corp the first of long island reit inc and the first of long island agency inc the consolidated entity is referred to as the corporation and the bank and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the bank although the banks primary service area is currently nassau and suffolk counties long island it does have two commercial banking branches in manhattan three full service branches in queens and one in brooklyn expansion of the banks branch distribution system particularly in the new york city boroughs of queens and brooklyn is an ongoing initiative overview net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of  were  million and  respectively representing increases over the same period last year of  and  respectively dividends per share increased  from  for the first three months of  to  for the current threemonth period returns on average assets roa and average equity roe for the first three months of  were  and  respectively versus  and  respectively for the same period last year book value per share increased from  at yearend  to  at the close of the current quarter the credit quality of the banks loan and securities portfolios remains excellent and the mortgage pipeline at quarterend was strong at  million analysis of first quarter earnings net income for the first quarter of  was  million an increase of  million or  over the same quarter last year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in net interest income of  million or  and noninterest income of  partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses of  noninterest expense of  and income tax expense of  the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in average interestearning assets of  million or  average interestearning assets grew due to increases in the average balances of loans and securities the growth in loans and securities was funded by growth in the average balances of noninterestbearing checking deposits interestbearing deposits shortterm borrowings and stockholders equity net interest margin was  for the first quarter of  essentially unchanged as compared to  for the first quarter of  the  increase in noninterest income is primarily attributable to increases in cash value accretion on bankowned life insurance service charges on deposit accounts securities gains investment management division income and real estate tax refunds the  increase in the provision for loan losses is largely due to more loan growth in the current quarter loans grew  million in the first quarter of  versus  million in the same quarter last year the impact of loan growth on the provision in each quarter was partially offset by improved economic conditions and in the first quarter of  a reduction in historical loss rates the  increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributable to increases in salaries employee benefits expense occupancy and equipment expense and legal and consulting expense partially offset by decreases in fdic insurance expense and computer and telecommunications expense the  increase in income tax expense is mainly attributable to higher pretax earnings in the current quarter and an increase in the effective tax rate from  in the  quarter to  in the current quarter asset quality the banks allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased  basis points from  at yearend  to  at march   the decrease is primarily due to adjustments to certain qualitative factors to reflect improved economic conditions the provision for loan losses was  and  in the first quarter of  and  respectively the amount of the provision in each quarter was driven mainly by loan growth offset by improved economic conditions and in the first quarter of  further offset by a reduction in the historical loss component of the allowance for loan losses the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains excellent nonaccrual loans amounted to  million or  of total loans outstanding at march   compared to  million or  at december   the decrease was primarily attributable to two loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings being returned to accrual status based on the demonstrated ability of the borrowers to service their debt troubled debt restructurings amounted to  million or  of total loans outstanding at march   of the troubled debt restructurings  million are performing in accordance with their modified terms and  are nonaccrual and included in the aforementioned amount of nonaccrual loans loans past due  through  days amounted to  million or  of total loans outstanding at march   compared to  million or  at december   management does not believe that the increase in loans past due  to  days is indicative of a deterioration in the overall credit quality of the banks loan portfolio the credit quality of the banks securities portfolio also remains excellent the banks mortgage securities are backed by mortgages underwritten on conventional terms with  of these securities being full faith and credit obligations of the us government and the balance being obligations of us government sponsored entities the remainder of the banks securities portfolio principally consists of high quality general obligation municipal securities rated aa or better by major rating agencies in selecting municipal securities for purchase the bank uses credit agency ratings for screening purposes only and then performs its own credit analysis on an ongoing basis the bank periodically assesses the credit strength of the municipal securities in its portfolio and makes decisions to hold or sell based on such assessments key strategic initiatives key strategic initiatives will continue to include loan and deposit growth through effective relationship management targeted solicitation efforts new product offerings and continued expansion of the banks branch distribution system on long island and in the new york city boroughs of queens and brooklyn with respect to loan growth the bank will continue to prudently manage concentration risk and further develop its broker and correspondent relationships small business credit scored loans equipment finance loans and small business administration sba loans along with the banks traditional commercial and industrial loan products will be originated to diversify the banks loan portfolio and help mitigate the impact of the low rate environment on the banks earnings the banks growing branch distribution system currently consists of  branches in nassau and suffolk counties long island and the boroughs of queens brooklyn and manhattan the bank expects to open four more branches in the next  months and continues to evaluate sites for further branch expansion one of the new branches will be in east setauket long island one will be in queens and two will be in brooklyn in addition to loan and deposit growth management is also focused on growing noninterest income from existing and potential new sources which may include the development or acquisition of feebased businesses challenges we face since december  there have been three  basis point increases in the federal funds target rate to its current level of  to  further increases are expected and could exert upward pressure on nonmaturity deposit rates at the same time intermediate and longterm interest rates remain relatively low resulting in suboptimal investing and lending rates additionally there is significant price competition for loans in the banks marketplace and little room for the bank to reduce its deposit rates these factors will make it difficult to improve net interest margin and could result in a decline in net interest margin from its current level and inhibit earnings growth for the foreseeable future the banking industry continues to be faced with new and complex regulatory requirements and enhanced supervisory oversight the president has indicated that regulatory relief and tax reform will be forthcoming but the timing magnitude and impact of any such changes are yet to be determined in the current environment banking regulators are increasingly concerned about among other things growth commercial real estate concentrations underwriting of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans capital levels cyber security and as of late predatory sales practices regulatory requirements and enhanced oversight are exerting downward pressure on revenues and upward pressure on required capital levels and the cost of doing business net interest income average

was  million an increase of  million or  over  million for the first quarter of  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average interestearning assets of  million or  partially offset by a one basis point decline in net interest margin from  to  the increase in average interestearning assets is comprised of growth in the average balances of loans of  million or  and securities of  million or  although most of the loan growth occurred in mortgage loans commercial and industrial loans also grew with an increase in average outstandings of  million or  the banks continued ability to grow loans is attributable to a variety of factors including among others competitive pricing targeted solicitation efforts the introduction of new loan products advertising campaigns and broker and correspondent relationships for both residential and commercial mortgages the growth in loans and securities was funded by growth in the average balances of noninterestbearing checking deposits of  million or  interestbearing deposits of  million or  shortterm borrowings of  million and stockholders equity of  million a substantial contributor to the growth in deposits was new branch openings the banks ongoing ability to grow deposits is attributable to among other things continued expansion of the banks branch distribution system targeted solicitation of local commercial businesses and municipalities new and expanded lending relationships new small business checking and loan products and the expansion of merchant sales relationships in addition management believes that the banks positive reputation in its marketplace has contributed to both loan and deposit growth a substantial contributor to the growth in stockholders equity was  million of capital raised in an underwritten public offering completed in may  net interest margin of  for the first quarter of  remained essentially unchanged as compared to  in the same quarter last year the current level of net interest margin reflects the low interest rate environment that has persisted for an extended period of time on a going forward basis if available yields for loans and securities prepayment penalties and the cost of deposits and borrowings remain at current levels net interest margin is not expected to meaningfully decline this expectation is based on the fact that significant portions of the banks mortgage loan and securities portfolios were originated or purchased in a low rate environment at yields similar to those currently available noninterest income noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts investment management division income gains or losses on sales of securities and all other items of income other than interest resulting from the business activities of the corporation noninterest income increased  or  when comparing the first quarter of  to the same period last year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in cash value accretion on bankowned life insurance of  service charges on deposit accounts of  securities gains of  investment management division income of  and real estate tax refunds of  cash value accretion increased because of purchases of bankowned life insurance during the first quarter of  with an initial cash value of  million the increase in service charges on deposit accounts is due to higher deposit account overdraft and maintenance and activity charges securities gains of  in the current quarter resulted from a deleveraging transaction involving the sale of approximately  million of availableforsale mortgagebacked securities and use of the proceeds to pay down shortterm borrowings if interest rates remain at current levels this transaction will reduce the banks net interest income on a going forward basis however it will improve the banks tier  leverage capital ratio and more importantly reduces the banks exposure to increasing interest rates investment management division income increased because of increases in assets under management resulting principally from improved equity market conditions noninterest expense noninterest expense is comprised of salaries employee benefits expense occupancy and equipment expense and other operating expenses incurred in supporting the various business activities of the corporation noninterest expense increased  or  when comparing the first quarter of  to the same period last year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in salaries of  or  employee benefits expense of  or  occupancy and equipment expense of  or  and legal and consulting expense of  the impact of these items was partially offset by decreases in fdic insurance expense of  and computer and telecommunications expense of  the increase in salaries is primarily due to new branch openings additions to staff in the back office higher stockbased compensation expense and normal annual salary adjustments the increase in employee benefits expense resulted primarily from increases in incentive compensation cost of  and group health insurance expense of  partially offset by a decrease in retirement plan expense of  the increase in health insurance expense resulted from increases in staff count and the rates being charged by insurance carriers the increase in occupancy and equipment expense includes the operating costs of new branches and increases in maintenance and repairs expense and the cost of servicing equipment the decrease in fdic insurance expense is attributable to lower fdic assessment rates effective july   partially offset by a growthrelated increase in the assessment base the decrease in computer and telecommunications expense reflects cost savings arising from renegotiation of the banks data processing contract in the fourth quarter of  and the elimination of phone lines due to the installation of a new phone system income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of book income effective tax rate was  for the first quarter of  compared to  for the same period last year the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decline in the percentage of pretax book income represented by income on taxexempt securities and state taxes in additional jurisdictions the impact of these items on the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit derived from the first quarter of  purchase of bankowned life insurance and the additional tax benefit derived in the current quarter from vesting and exercise of stock awards the  increase in income tax expense in the first quarter of  reflects the aforementioned increase in the effective tax rate and higher pretax earnings in the current quarter in the fourth quarter of  the corporation adopted asu  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting earnings for the first quarter of  were adjusted retroactively to reflect the adoption of the asu effective as of january   the asu increased net income in the first quarters of  and  through credits to income tax expense by  and  respectively application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts our determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain in the event that managements estimate needs to be adjusted based on among other things additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact either positively or negatively the banks results of operations the banks allowance for loan and lease losses committee alll committee which is a management committee chaired by the chief credit officer meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for determining the allowance for loan losses after considering among other things the results of credit reviews performed by the banks independent loan review consultants and the banks credit department in addition and in consultation with the banks chief financial officer and chief risk officer the alll committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining accounting policies and procedures surrounding the calculation of the required allowance the board loan committee reviews and approves the banks loan policy at least once each calendar year the banks allowance for loan losses is reviewed and ratified by the board loan committee on a quarterly basis and is subject to periodic examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency whose safety and soundness examination includes a determination as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred losses the first step in determining the allowance for loan losses is to identify loans in the banks portfolio that are individually deemed to be impaired and then measure impairment losses based on either the fair value of collateral or the discounted value of expected future cash flows in estimating the fair value of real estate collateral management utilizes appraisals or evaluations adjusted for costs to dispose and a distressed sale adjustment if needed estimating the fair value of collateral other than real estate is also subjective in nature and sometimes requires difficult and complex judgments determining expected future cash flows can be more subjective than determining fair values expected future cash flows could differ significantly both in timing and amount from the cash flows actually received over the loans remaining life in addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed the banks highest average annualized loss experience over periods of    or  months is generally the starting point in determining its allowance for loan losses for each pool of loans management believes that this approach appropriately reflects losses from the current economic cycle and those incurred losses in the banks loan portfolio however since future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past on a quarterly basis management adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current conditions in doing so management considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the weight to assign to each in estimating losses the factors include among others  delinquencies  economic conditions as judged by things such as median home prices and commercial vacancy rates in the banks service area and national and local
