releases advertisements articles kenny brown performance group becomes new suspension supplier and sponsor on chris cobettos  championshipwinning nasa american iron mustang motorsports tweet wauconda il  kenny brown performance group has taken another step forward in the professional road race world and partnered with chris cobetto and performance autoport in virginia to help win another nasa midatlantic american iron championship  kenny made his mark on professional racing last year with son paul brown winning the  pirelli world challenge championship and is expanding his pro racing support and sponsorship efforts in nasa american iron with cobetto racing according to kenny “chris is an incredible talent and his partnership with performance autosport is a perfect match for us  mark lamaskin is a great friend and supporter of our brand and the work he does at performance autosport is not only excellent but has put chris in the winners circle countless times  we feel really good about this alliance and are not only using it as a continual development platform for our suspension products but also another branding and marketing tool to showcase our technology” after winning both nasa american iron races march  where the car made its debut lamaskin commented our sponsor kenny brown performance sent us the new kb ags  gt suspension system and after running the car on friday cobetto was definitely feeling a difference from all the suspension changes the car felt more stable all over the track turned in nice and crisp and let him jump on the throttle with confidence earlier than before it will obviously take some tweaking to get absolutely perfect but the results are there  the kenny brown ags  gt suspension system just provides grip for days and solves all our previous problems with the car a little pushy under turnin and loose on exit the whole marriage is exactly what we’ve been looking for and we are excited to be using their products this year chris cobetto and the performance autosport mustang is also sporting a completely new livery this year with not only the addition of kenny brown performance but also moss motors and vaughn gittin jrs rtr brands  so not only does the car handle very well with an advanced geometry suspension but it also looks fantastic with the rtr exterior accompaniments  as a result of this cooperative effort
