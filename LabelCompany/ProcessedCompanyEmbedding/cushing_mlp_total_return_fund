illiquid due to among other things events relating to the issuer of the securities market events economic conditions investor perceptions or lack of market participants the lack of an active trading

issuers together with securities issued by any newly public mlps and may invest in securities of private mlps affiliates of mlps and nonmlp issuers consistent with its investment objective and policies an investment in the fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the fund’s shares the fund concentrates its investments in the natural resources sector with an emphasis on securities issued by mlps mlps and other natural resources sector companies are subject to certain risks including but not limited to fluctuations in the prices of commodities the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the fund will invest a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue operating
