a bedroom they protect your floor from wear and tear and your feet from a cold floor as well as enhance a room’s personality with the various colors patterns textures shapes and sizes that area rugs come in when choosing a bedroom rug take the following rule of thumb into consideration extend the carpet  inches around the bed for a king or queen bed the rug should extend  inches out from the sides for a twin or a full bed it should extend at least  inches out depending on the size of the room there can be more extension around the bed but most definitely not less as that would make the room look imbalanced and cover the entirety of the rug design with the bed a few other things to consider — what is your lifestyle like do you have pets or children a white carpet might not be the best alternative in this case and a sturdier longlasting material like wool or jute should be considered what is your decor style make sure you choose a rug that complements and enhances your current aesthetic how easy is it to clean consider if your rug will need to be dry cleaned or if standard vacuuming and carpet cleaning will suffice pillows  throwsadding decorative pillows and throw blankets to a bedroom is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your decor however before you start your hunt for the perfect pillow and throw blanket assemblage consider your current bedroom design if you have a neutral color palette of soft grays and whites a few brightly colored pillows or blankets will provide energetic pops of color if you already have a colorful home throwing in some subtler shades and patterns might be exactly what you need to complement your style and put the focal point on your polychromatic decor in general you should place two to six decorative pillows on your bed this will be enough to add a new element of style and color but not so much that you’ll have to spend  minutes removing pillows before you go to sleep throw blankets can be great arranged at the end of your bed showcasing their texture and pattern or elegantly draped over an armchair ready to snuggle up withtable lampstable lamps are one of those great decor items with a dual purpose — they are a complementary accent to your home while providing muchneeded light when choosing lamps consider this design rule you should not be able to see the neck of the light bulb or bulb socket from a standing or seated position if you can see it the lamp is likely too tall for your room and will cause glare for anyone standing or sitting in your bedroom most likely you however if you find a tall base that you just have to have get a larger lamp shade to cover the bulb and you’re all set tall lamps definitely contribute to an elegant ambience and elevate your room design to new heights literally if you want mood lighting or just a more decorative piece utilize an opaque shade if you’re an avid reader or need more light in your room use a translucent lampshade that distributes light throughout the space wall decor  mirrorsthe decor in your bedroom should be reflective of this space’s purpose  your bedroom is your refuge your retreat from the real world and it should make you feel happy content and inspired put up items that create a sense of peace if you have any specific pictures or pieces that make you happy or remind you of fun times these are great to include in your design if you have a large piece of wall art to hang put it in a place where it can be a focal point and won’t be overshadowed by clutter or other decor hanging and placing mirrors throughout your bedroom will reflect light and make it look larger as well as provide you ample opportunity to check out your outfit before work embed photo open photo in new window pagetype

mixedmedia art and metal wall art don’t belong on the same surface the key to getting your personalized style right is to pick the pieces that you can’t live without regardless of their medium or composition drawings paintings prints and posters have just as much of a right to be together as peanut butter and jelly that’s not to say that a collection of coordinating photographs can’t look just as stunning but it’s ultimately your preference that mattersthink beyond the typical home wall decorframed photos and pretty pictures are nice but they aren’t your only option when it comes to decorating bare walls consider hanging up a unique rug or an intricate tapestry instead these are not only visually appealing but add a textural element to your space have lots of trinkets and collectibles to display mount some attractive wall shelves and arrange them as you see fit if you don’t want to poke holes through your drywall try putting up some wallpaper or wall decals which

from using a moisturizer after cleansing the key is finding the appropriate moisturizer based on your skin type moisturizers seal moisture into the skin so the effect is hydrating while also inhibiting evaporation many moisturizers contain active ingredients that deliver vitamins minerals antioxidants and skin supporting compounds to provide therapeutic benefits that sooth protect and ultimately help delay the onset of early aging eye creams are optional but may be desirable for those with dry or aging skin as a welcome addendum to a moisturizer some individuals have very delicate eye areas that are more susceptible to wrinkling dark circles and puffiness an eye cream can help address these specific concerns with intense moisture and a high concentration of active ingredients how to choose a moisturizer the oilier your complexion the lighter and more liquid your moisturizer should be some moisturizers even have oil free ingredients that still serve to moisturize the skin without adding oil conversely dry or aging skin requires a more moisturizingnourishing preparation use a moisturizer labeled with your skin type or specific skin concern if you live in a particularly harsh climate consider wearing a more moisturizing face cream during the winter and switch to a lighter formula during warmer months night creams tend to be thicker and more moisturizing than day creams it is generally recommended to have separate moisturizers simply for the fact that you will want a day cream with a sun protection factor spf this will provide you with added protection from sun damage that can lead to premature aging based on the amount of time you spend outside on any particular day you might want to wear a moisturizer designed for outdoor use with a significantly higher spf you must also factor in how easily your skin burns and take precautions to protect your skin with a sufficient spf as a general rule it is recommended that your day moisturizer should have at least  spf and if you spend more time outdoors consider a moisturizer with  spf how to use moisturizer after you wash your face and apply toner or a serum optional scoop out enough moisturizer to comfortably cover your face and neck area using your fingertips rub it in using upward strokes making sure to moisturize the neck décolletage and earlobes in order to prevent streaks allow your

skin cells while speeding up the skins process of shedding which slows with aging or mature skin exfoliation also helps to stimulate the blood circulation brighten the complexion by improving color and texture smooth fine lines and wrinkles and prevent buildup that can lead to break outs without exfoliation skin can take on an uneven tone looking dull patchy or even ashy after exfoliation skin serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate more effectively allowing the active ingredients to penetrate more successfully and thus leading to better beauty product results as a general rule you will want to exfoliate at least once per week you can adjust your schedule according to your needs the texture of the exfoliant may also factor in the frequency of usage a finer grained exfoliator might be tolerated well and could be used more often if desired if your skin becomes irritated or flaky reduce the frequency of exfoliating or switch to one with finer texture sometimes exfoliating ingredients are added to toners or also come in the form of masks these products provide more options to incorporate exfoliating ingredients into your regimen how to choose an exfoliator choose an

easily irritated once the cleansing is completed rinse liberally with tepid water make sure all areas are rinsed including the neck hairline and eye area cool water may be used as it helps to close the pores finish by blotting your face gently with a towel using a patting technique video  ingredients ingredients exfoliate jojoba cleanser agua decyl glucoside cocamidopropyl betaine jojoba esters
