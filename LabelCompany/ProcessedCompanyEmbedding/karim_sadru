samantha garnett what causes age spots by samantha garnett is there a cure for melasma by samantha garnett got a suggestion for an article or special feature contact us     skin care roundup which products are the biggest bang for your buck by michelle klein skincarecopcomfor the past year weve been asking our readers to submit their favorite products via email facebook and twitter so we could review the top favorites for our annual skin care roundup we received hundreds of submissions in nearly every category from antiaging creams to eyeliners thanks to our voting process we were able to narrow down the top three contenders in each category our editors then went out and actually purchased these products so we could find the ones that were deserving of our editors choice award we tested each product for at least one month and considered every factor such as product effectiveness customer service and refund policies what we found was quite shocking  some products were truly miracles in a bottle where as others failed to live up to their manufacturers claims this year weve broken down our skin care roundup into  parts   part  skin lighteners skin lighteners have been around for decades but these days more and more people are finding uses for these products to help with common skin conditions like age spots acne scars and melasma in the past it was difficult to find high quality products and most manufacturers were using low grade hydroquinone in their formulas hydroquinone is known to reduce hyperpigmentation but there are also many concerns regarding its safety fortunately in the past few years more natural alternatives have started to come up and its now very easy to find high quality products from reputable brands while we appreciate the industrys push towards natural ingredients its becoming more and more difficult to deceiver which ingredients actually work and which products live up to their claims some of the skin lightening ingredients we preferred were natural extracts such as arbutin kojic acid niacinamide vitamin b and bearberry most of these ingredients are tolerable by majority of skin types and dont have the same side effects of hydroquinone skin care cop tested over a dozen products and found one worthy of our editors choice award we also included a few runnerup products that were voted highly by our readers sort by highest rating   number of votes name   pros strongest formula available overthecounter hydroquinonefree manufacturer offers a money back guarantee professionally tested for safety packaged in an airless dispenser preventing light and air from damaging cream results seen in a short period of time cons does not come in very large sizes sunblock has to be purchased separately currently only available online meladerm by civant skin care civantskincarecom currently  rating   votes cast click stars to vote we tried numerous products ranging from high end department store brands down to affordable over the counter creams while we did find some products that stood out in one or two areas only meladerm by civant skin care checked all of the boxes on our list we considered many factors such as the quality of the finished product and also the customer service track record of the manufacturer meladerm by civant skin care excelled in every category and was also voted highly by our readers meladerm has been on the market for over  years and in that time has established quite a reputation despite the long list of glowing reviews on the companys website what really compelled us to order was the unconditional money back guarantee a product is only as good as the company behind it  so with this in mind we sent civant skin care a few email inquiries and fortunately they responded quickly and answered all of our questions with thorough responses additionally we also liked the companys commitment to using safe and natural ingredients as there are many dangerous products out there in the skin lightening market the bottom line meladerm is one of the most popular skin lighteners on the market today the formula was effective in our tests and contains a long laundry list of active ingredients overall it appeared that most of civant skin cares customers tend to be satisfied with the product and for those unfortunate few that dont see noticeable results the company will offer a refund within  days description manufacturer  civant skin care compatible with all skin types day money back guarantee strongest formula available over the counter suggested price   for  oz visit the manufacturers site pros goes on smoothly highly moisturizing hydroquinonefree well established brand with long history easily available in many department stores suitable for sensitive skin types cons heavy consistency sunblock has to be purchased separately more expensive than competitors white lucent brightening moisturizing cream by shiseido shiseidocom currently  rating   votes cast click stars to vote shiseido is a japanese company and probably one of the oldest skin care companies out there white lucent consists of several products and replaced the popular uv white skincare line we did not test every product in the white lucent line but rather focused on the brightening moisturizing cream since this is the one that really targets hyperpigmentation and was popular with our readers the white lucent brightening moisturizing cream consists of mostly natural extracts and was very well suited for individuals with sensitive skin types while the cream has a rich feel it goes on smoothly and almost provides a calming sensation to the skin the shiseido company is known for extremely high quality products so this one is no exception it is easy to order online or through many big retailers like sephora and macys the bottom line while lucent is one of the best selling product lines in japan where skin lightening products are always in high demand shiseido is well known and reputable company known for luxurious products and luxurious prices the white lucent brightening cream was easily one of the most expensive products in our tests however it still proved to be very popular with our readers description manufacturer  shiseido sold in majority of retail stores part of the white lucent product line suggested price   for  oz  visit the manufacturers site pros contains many acids and active skin lightening ingredients hydroquinonefree penetrates deep into the skin small bottle lasts a long time cons does not come in very large sizes sunblock has to be purchased separately some acids can be aggravating to the skin contains alcohol which can be drying potent botanical skin brightening gel complex by peter thomas roth peterthomasrothcom currently  rating   votes cast click stars to vote the peter thomas roth brand consists of over  products that target everything from acne to wrinkles the company was launched in the early s and has gained a lot of popularity in the past few years the brand is now sold through many online and retail distributors we really like gels when it comes to skin lightening products the benefits of a gel is that it goes on much lighter than a cream and can often penetrate further into the skin the potent botanical skin brightening gel complex not only has a very long name but also a long list of active ingredients many of these actives are acids such as salicylic and azelaic which not only help with hyperpigmentation but also with exfoliation of dead skin the downside to acids is that sometimes they can be a bit irritating especially on those with very sensitive skin types the bottom line the potent botanical skin brightening gel complex is a strong formula that consists of various acids and natural skin lightening ingredients the formula penetrates well and helps with exfoliation however it can also be drying and irritating to the skin for some individuals the bottle comes in a  oz size which lasts a very long time since only a small amount is needed per application description manufacturer  peter thomas roth sold through many online retailers suggested price   for  oz   visit the manufacturers site pros one of the strongest formulas available for stubborn hyperpigmentation penetrates deep into the skin cons uses hydroquionone which can cause side effects can be too strong for sensitive skin types fairly expensive for a small bottle has to be purchased and used under a doctors supervision nu derm clear fx skin brightening cream by obagi obagicom currently  rating   votes cast click stars to vote obagi is a company that needs no introduction the brand has been extremely popular with doctors and estheticians and is typically only sold through professionals the reason for this is that the obagi products contain higher concentrations of active ingredients than most overthecounter brands some of the products in the obagi line also use prescription ingredients which require the guidance of a professional nu derm clear uses hydroquinone as its active ingredient typically we like to see natural alternatives but in some cases hydroquinone can be effective for really stubborn pigmentation because hydroquinone has some associated side effects it is highly advised to use it only under the care of a doctor we found that the nu derm clear was effective in treating really deep pigmentation but many users also found the formula to be a bit harsh on their skin the bottom line nu derm clear is part of the obagi nu derm system which comes with additional products to help with hyperpigmentation because nu derm clear uses hydroquinone it is recommended for pigmentation that doesnt respond to natural ingredients like arbutin and kojic acid we would suggest trying nu derm if you have had zero luck with other products and if you are under the supervision of a doctor description manufacturer  obagi sold only through professionals suggested price   for  oz   visit the manufacturers site pros contains natural ingredients hydroquinonefree very gentle and suitable for daily use cons does not come in very large sizes sunblock has to be purchased separately gentle formula takes longer to show results discoloration reversal moisturizer by ddf ddfskincarecom currently  rating   votes cast click stars to vote ddf makes some really high quality products for nearly every skin problem you can imagine the brand was developed under the guidance of dermatologists and has established itself as a leader in the skin care industry one of the things we liked the most about ddf was the dedication to great customer service we found their online chat representatives to be extremely helpful and the customer policies to be very fair the discoloration reversal moisturizer is one of four products in the ddf hyperpigmentation line the moisturizer uses natural ingredients such as niacinamide another name for vitamin b and various plant extracts to help target pigmentation in the skin we found the formula to be extremely gentle and suitable for every day use it comes in a nice metallic dispenser which protects the product from light and air contamination though we did like the way the product felt on the skin we didnt see any significant changes in the first  weeks of use this product may be suitable for individuals that have very sensitive skin and can not tolerate stronger products the bottom line the discoloration reversal moisturizer is a very gentle cream that can be applied daily without any adverse effects however due to its gentle nature it may also take longer to see significant results it may also be necessary to use the other products in the hyperpigmentation line to improve overall performance we would recommend this product to individuals with very sensitive skin description manufacturer  ddf sold through many online retailers suggested price   for  oz   visit the manufacturers site related articles what is hyperpigmentation by samantha garnett what causes age spots by samantha garnett is there a cure for melasma by samantha garnett reader comments comment submission is currently closed meladerm cream by dbetty thank you so much for your review ive always loved reading reviews from the skin care cop anyway i just started with the meladerm a few weeks ago and things have been going great ive seen quite a bit of fading on two age spots and also a overall evening of my skin tone thanks again almost perfect by goldenlab ive seen sooo much improvement just in the past month that even my doctor has been asking what i use the only reason im not giving this cream  stars is because i think the price is kinda high and for the price they should give you a larger bottle or at least give you more discounts for purchasing several bottles but really this is great and ive already ordered  times finally promises results by pritis i was pretty skeptical about meladerm but boy have my doubts been cleared only a few days of use and i already see a lightening of acne marks on face ive used so many products before including prescriptions but this is the first to show any results thank you skin care cop highly reocmmended by meladermuser really like the feel and texture of meladerm i am seeing some results slowly but overall very happy would recommend to others with hyperpigmentation   tell a friend   email
