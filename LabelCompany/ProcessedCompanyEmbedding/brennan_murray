book examines the drivers of regionalism and integration in both europe and asia and seeks to forge comparative perspectives between the two regions comprising contributions from scholars analysts and policymakers this volume explores and debates how and why regional bodies such as the european union eu and the association of southeast asian nations asean are formed and sustained furthermore it examines the drivers of and impediments to regionalism and integration the debates regarding what and who constitute drivers are presented in a fresh thematic and comprehensive manner leadership and core states are also critically examined whilst material ideational and normative factors are all assessed comparatively significantly in light of the global financial crisis the book considers the role of crisis as a driver of regionalism and integration this book will be of interest to students scholars and policymakers interested in asian and european politics and comparative politicsreviewsthis is a scholarly comprehensive and timely study of the different experiences of regional integration that europe and asia two of the world’s most diverse and important areas have had in recent history covering issues like trust sovereignty reconciliation and values the contributors show that in spite of differences there is much that both can learn from each other as they strive

drivers and development of regionalism in europe and asia covering a wide range of themes and providing comparative perspectives between the two regions its worthy analysis represents an invaluable guide and a mustread for all who are interested in regional studies emil kirchner jean monnet chair university of essex this is an excellent book that fills a much needed gap in the literature on regional integration by analysing the comparative drivers of regional cooperation in europe and asia what is especially welcome in this volume is a comparative approach that does not take european regional integration as a benchmark for asian regional integration it sets out an exciting agenda for future work on comparative regionalism which will be invaluable for researches working on regional governance highly recommended kanishka jayasuriya professor of politics and international studies and director of the indopacific governance research centre at the university of adelaide detailed yet highly accessible a cuttingedge account of the key driving forces behind regional integration in europe and asia carefully avoiding a eurocentric approach the contributing authors provide scholars and policymakers alike with an essential source of conceptual empirical comparative and multidisciplinary insights into the study of regions bart gaens senior research fellow the finnish institute of international affairs the european union eu and the association of southeast asian nations asean are two relatively successful regional organizations in the world and their transregional cooperation in the asiaeurope meeting asem is likely to redefine and affect both regional and global politics in this context there is an increasing demand for knowledge in order to understand both regional organizations and their collaborative relations and efforts this edited book meets this demand by undertaking a comprehensive comparative study of european and asian regionalism the intellectual virtue of this book lies in the fact that it brings together diverse scholars from both regions and offers a variety of fresh perspectives the uniqueness of this book is its focus on the multifaceted drivers of as well as impediments to regionalism in comparative terms it covers a wide range of issues such as the role of crisis traditional and nontraditional security economic dynamics regional institutions and processes of european and asian regional integration i strongly recommend it as a textbook for graduate courses on international relations comparative regionalism and global politics
