information regarding twilio’s results the following nongaap financial measures are disclosed nongaap gross profit and gross margin nongaap operating expenses nongaap loss from operations and operating margin nongaap net loss attributable to common stockholders nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted and nongaap weightedaverage shares used to compute nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted nongaap gross profit and nongaap gross margin twilio defines nongaap gross profit and nongaap gross margin as gaap gross profit and gaap gross margin respectively adjusted to exclude stockbased compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles nongaap operating expenses twilio defines nongaap operating expenses including categories of operating expenses as gaap operating expenses and categories of operating expenses adjusted to exclude as applicable stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangibles acquisitionrelated expenses release of tax liabilities upon obligation settlement gain on lease termination and payroll taxes related to stockbased compensation nongaap loss from operations and nongaap operating margin twilio defines nongaap loss from operations and nongaap operating margin as gaap loss from operations and gaap operating margin respectively adjusted to exclude stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangibles acquisitionrelated expenses release of tax liabilities upon obligation settlement gain on lease termination and payroll taxes related to stockbased compensation nongaap net loss attributable to common stockholders and nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted twilio defines nongaap net loss attributable to common stockholders and nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted as gaap net loss attributable to common stockholders and gaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted respectively adjusted to exclude stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangibles acquisitionrelated expenses release of tax liabilities upon obligation settlement gain on lease termination and payroll taxes related to stockbased compensation and in the case of nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted amounts attributable to convertible preferred stock in order to calculate nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted twilio uses a nongaap weightedaverage share count twilio defines nongaap weightedaverage shares used to compute nongaap net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted as gaap weighted average shares used to compute net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted adjusted to reflect the conversion of convertible preferred stock outstanding into class b common stock as if it had occurred at the beginning of the period twilio’s management uses the foregoing nongaap financial information collectively to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes twilio’s management believes that nongaap financial information when taken collectively may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance facilitates periodtoperiod comparisons of results of operations and assists in comparisons with other companies many of which use similar nongaap financial information to supplement their gaap results nongaap financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarlytitled nongaap measures used by other companies whenever twilio uses a nongaap financial measure a reconciliation is provided to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with gaap investors are encouraged to review the related gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures with respect to twilio’s guidance as provided under “outlook” above twilio has not reconciled its expectations as to nongaap loss from operations to gaap loss from operations or nongaap net loss per share to gaap net loss per share because stockbased compensation expense cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time accordingly a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort operating metrics twilio reviews a number of operating metrics to evaluate its business measure performance identify trends formulate business plans and make strategic decisions these include the number of active customer accounts base revenue and the dollarbased net expansion rate number of active customer accounts twilio believes that the number of active customer accounts is an important indicator of the growth of its business the market acceptance of its platform and future revenue trends twilio defines an active customer account at the end of any period as an individual account as identified by a unique account identifier for which twilio has recognized at least  of revenue in the last month of the period twilio believes that use of its platform by customers at or above the  per month threshold is a stronger indicator of potential future engagement than trial usage of its platform or usage at levels below  per month a single organization may constitute multiple unique active customer accounts if it has multiple account identifiers each of which is treated as a separate active customer account base revenue twilio monitors base revenue as one of the more reliable indicators of future revenue trends base revenue consists of all revenue other than revenue from large active customer accounts that have never entered into month minimum revenue commitment contracts with twilio which the company refers to as variable customer accounts while almost all of twilio’s customers exhibit some level of variability in the usage of its products based on the experience of twilio’s management twilio believes that variable customer accounts are more likely to have significant fluctuations in usage of its products from period to period and therefore that revenue from variable customer accounts may also fluctuate significantly from period to period this behavior is best evidenced by the decision of such customers not to enter into contracts with twilio that contain minimum revenue commitments even though they may spend significant amounts on the use of the company’s products and they may be foregoing more favorable terms often available to customers that enter into committed contracts with twilio this variability adversely affects twilio’s ability to rely upon revenue from variable customer accounts when analyzing expected trends in future revenue for historical periods through march   twilio defined a variable customer account as an active customer account that i had never signed a minimum revenue commitment contract with the company for a term of at least  months and ii has met or exceeded  of the company’s revenue in any quarter in the periods presented through march   to allow for consistent periodtoperiod comparisons in the event a customer qualified as a variable customer account as of march   or a previously variable customer account ceased to be an active customer account as of such date twilio included such customer as a variable customer account in all periods presented for reporting periods starting with the three months ended june   twilio defines a variable customer account as a customer account that a has been categorized as a variable customer account in any prior quarter as well as b any new customer account that i has never signed a minimum revenue commitment contract with twilio for a term of at least  months and ii meets or exceeds  of the company’s revenue in a quarter once a customer account is deemed to be a variable customer account in any period they remain a variable customer account in subsequent periods unless they enter into a minimum revenue commitment contract with twilio for a term of at least  months dollarbased net expansion rate twilio’s ability to drive growth and generate incremental revenue depends in part on the company’s ability to maintain and grow its relationships with existing active customer accounts and to increase their use of the platform an important way in which twilio tracks its performance in this area is by measuring the dollarbased net expansion rate for active customer accounts other than variable customer accounts twilio’s dollarbased net expansion rate increases when such active customer accounts increase their usage of a product extend their usage of a product to new applications or adopt a new product twilio’s dollarbased net expansion rate decreases when such active customer accounts cease or reduce their usage of a product or when the company lowers usage prices on a product as our customers grow their businesses and extend the use of our platform they sometimes create multiple customer accounts with us for operational or other reasons as such for reporting periods starting with the three months ended december   when we identify a significant customer organization defined as a single customer organization generating more than  of revenue in a quarterly reporting period that has created a new active customer account this new active customer account is tied to and revenue from this new active customer account is included with the original active customer account for the purposes of calculating this metric twilio believes that measuring dollarbased net expansion rate on revenue generated from active customer accounts other than variable customer accounts provides a more meaningful indication of the performance of the company’s efforts to increase revenue from existing customer accounts twilio’s dollarbased net expansion rate compares the revenue from active customer accounts other than variable customer accounts in a quarter to the same quarter in the prior year to calculate the dollarbased net expansion rate the company first identifies the cohort of active customer accounts other than variable customer accounts that were active customer accounts in the same quarter of the prior year the dollarbased net expansion rate is the quotient obtained by dividing the revenue generated from that cohort in a quarter by the revenue generated from that same cohort in the corresponding quarter in the prior year when twilio calculates dollarbased net expansion rate for periods longer than one quarter it uses the average of the applicable quarterly dollarbased net expansion rates for each of the quarters in such period
