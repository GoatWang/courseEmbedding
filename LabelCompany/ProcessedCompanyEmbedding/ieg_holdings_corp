factors   investment in our securities involves a number of substantial risks you should not invest in our securities unless you are able to bear the complete loss of your investment in addition to the risks and investment considerations discussed elsewhere in this prospectus the following factors should be carefully considered by anyone purchasing the securities offered through this prospectus the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business could be harmed in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or a part of their investment   risks related to our business and industry   our limited operating history and our failure since inception to achieve an operating profit makes our future prospects and financial performance unpredictable   we commenced operations in  and as a result we have a limited operating history upon which a potential investor can evaluate our prospects and the potential value of an investment in our company in addition we have not made an operating profit since our incorporation we remain subject to the risks inherently associated with new business enterprises in general and more specifically the risks of a new financial institution and in particular a new internetbased financial institution our prospects are subject to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development including the risk that we will not be able to implement our business strategy if we are unable to implement our business strategy and grow our business our business will be materially adversely affected   we may not be able to implement our plans for growth successfully which could adversely affect our future operations   since january  the amount we have loaned to borrowers our loan book has increased by  from  to  as of september   we expect to continue to grow our loan book and number of customers at an accelerated rate following completion of this offering our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to manage our growth we may not be able to achieve our growth plans or sustain our historical growth rates or grow at all various factors such as economic conditions regulatory and legislative considerations and competition may also impede our ability to expand our market presence if we are unable to grow as planned our business and prospects could be adversely affected   our inability to manage our growth could harm our business   we anticipate that our loan book and customer base will continue to grow significantly over time to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will be required to among other things     ● improve existing and implement new transaction processing operational and financial systems procedures and controls         ● maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines and         ● increase our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base   if we are unable to manage growth effectively our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available which could harm our business   our growth will require that we generate additional capital either through retained earnings or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all any equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders or reduction in the earnings available to our common stockholders if adequate capital is not available or the terms of such capital are not attractive we may have to curtail our growth and our business and our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected              as an online consumer loan company whose principal means of delivering personal loans is the internet we are subject to risks particular to that method of delivery   we are predominantly an online consumer loan company and there are a number of unique factors that internetbased loan companies face these include concerns for the security of personal information the absence of personal relationships between lenders and customers the absence of loyalty to a conventional hometown branch customers’ difficulty in understanding and assessing the substance and financial strength of an online loan company a lack of confidence in the likelihood of success and permanence of online loan companies and many individuals’ unwillingness to trust their personal details and financial future to a relatively new technological medium such as the internet as a result some potential customers may be unwilling to establish a relationship with us   conventional “brick and mortar” consumer loan companies in growing numbers are offering the option of internetbased lending to their existing and prospective customers the public may perceive conventional established loan companies as being safer more responsive more comfortable to deal with and more accountable as providers of their lending needs we may not be able to offer internetbased lending that has sufficient advantages over the internetbased lending services and other characteristics of conventional “brick and mortar” consumer loan companies to enable us to compete successfully   we may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity   both the internet and the financial services industry are undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition to improving the ability to serve customers the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers if we are unable for technical legal financial or other reasons to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions customer requirements or emerging industry standards our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   a significant disruption in our computer systems or a cyber security breach could adversely affect our operations   we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our loan origination and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses cyber security breaches vandalism severe weather conditions catastrophic events and human error and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business   our ability to protect the confidential information of our borrowers and investors may be adversely affected by cyberattacks computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or similar disruptions   we process certain sensitive data from our borrowers and investors while we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we receive or have access to our security measures could be breached any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our systems could cause confidential borrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information timeconsuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity if security measures are breached because of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged and we could incur significant liability   because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition federal regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity which may cause borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures any security breach whether actual or perceived would harm our reputation we could lose borrowers and investors and our business and operations could be adversely affected   any significant disruption in service on our platform or in our computer systems including events beyond our control could prevent us from processing or posting payments on loans reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace and result in a loss of borrowers or investors              in the event of a system outage and physical data loss our ability to perform our servicing obligations process applications or make loans available would be materially and adversely affected the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our technology are critical to our operations customer service reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors   any interruptions or delays in our service whether as a result of thirdparty error our error natural disasters or security breaches whether accidental or willful could harm our relationships with our borrowers and investors and our reputation additionally in the event of damage or interruption our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage these factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans damage our brand and reputation divert our employees’ attention reduce our revenue subject us to liability and cause borrowers and investors to abandon our marketplace any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our unsecured loans generally have delinquency and default rates higher than prime and secured loans which could result in higher loan losses   we are in the business of originating unsecured personal loans as of september   approximately  of our customers are subprime borrowers which we define as borrowers having credit scores below  on the credit risk scale developed by vantagescore solutions llc unsecured personal loans and subprime loans generally have higher delinquency and default rates than secured loans and prime loans subprime borrowers are associated with lower collection rates and are subject to higher loss rates than prime borrowers subprime borrowers have historically been and may in the future become more likely to be affected or more severely affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions particularly unemployment if our borrowers default under an unsecured loan we will bear a risk of loss of principal which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations delinquency interrupts the flow of projected interest income from a loan and default can ultimately lead to a loss we attempt to manage these risks with riskbased loan pricing and appropriate management policies however we cannot assure you that such management policies will prevent delinquencies or defaults and if such policies and methods are insufficient to control our delinquency and default risks and do not result in appropriate loan pricing our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations could be harmed if aspects of our business including the quality of our borrowers are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes if we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors or if such changes affect our borrowers’ capacity to repay their loans our results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected at september   we had  loans considered past due at  days past due representing  of the number of loans in our active portfolio at september   we had  loans delinquent or in default defined as  days past due representing  of the number of loans in our active portfolio loans become eligible for a lender to take legal action at  days past due   if our estimates of loan receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses our provision for loan receivable losses would increase which would adversely affect our results of operations   we maintain an allowance for loans receivable losses to estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan receivable losses we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan receivable collectability including the total amount of loan receivables outstanding historical loan receivable chargeoffs our current collection patterns and economic trends if customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate housing foreclosures and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for loan receivable losses our provision may be inadequate our allowance for loan receivable losses is an estimate and if actual loan receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for loan receivable losses our financial position liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected   our risk management efforts may not be effective which could result in unforeseen losses   we could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify manage monitor and mitigate financial risks such as credit risk interest rate risk prepayment risk liquidity risk and other marketrelated risks as well as operational risks related to our business assets and liabilities our risk management policies procedures and techniques including our scoring methodology may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to mitigate the risks we have identified or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future              we face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy   our business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive there is strong competition for customers from personal loan companies and other types of consumer lenders including those that use the internet as a medium for lending or as an advertising platform our competitors include     ● large publiclytraded statelicensed personal loan companies such as onemain         ● peertopeer lending companies such as lendingclub corp and prosper marketplace inc         ● online personal loan companies such as avant         ● “brick and mortar” personal loan companies including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online lending and         ● payday lenders tribal lenders and other online consumer loan companies   some of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have name recognition and an established customer base most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources in order to compete profitably we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans which may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations to remain competitive we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy our success depends on among other things     ● having a large and increasing number of customers who use our loans for financing needs         ● our ability to attract hire and retain key personnel as our business grows         ● our ability to secure additional capital as needed         ● our ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors         ● the satisfaction of our customers with our customer service         ● ease of use of our websites and         ● our ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for providing personal loans that provides us with reliable and effective operational financial and information systems   if we are unable to implement our business strategy our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   we depend on thirdparty service providers for our core operations including online lending and loan servicing and interruptions in or terminations of their services could materially impair the quality of our services   we rely substantially upon thirdparty service providers for our core operations including online web lending and marketing and vendors that provide systems that automate the servicing of our loan portfolios which allow us to increase the efficiency and accuracy of our operations these systems include tracking and accounting of our loan portfolio as well as customer relationship management collections funds disbursement security and reporting this reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or longterm disruption of our operations if these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed if such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel our business could suffer   our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our chief executive officer paul mathieson and our chief operating officer carla cholewinski competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel we do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance the loss of the service of our chief executive officer or our chief operating officer or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business              we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public reporting company   in april  we became a public reporting company as a public reporting company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a nonreporting company including costs associated with our sec reporting requirements we expect that the additional reporting and other obligations imposed on us under the exchange act will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of our related legal accounting and administrative activities significantly management estimates that compliance with the exchange act reporting requirements as a reporting company will cost in excess of  annually given our current financial resources these additional compliance costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and ability to achieve profitable results these increased costs will require us to divert money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives   we operate in a highly competitive market and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity   the consumer finance industry is highly competitive our success depends in large part on our ability to originate consumer loan receivables we compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating loan receivables some of these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources than we possess some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us while banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to nonprime customers in recent years there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities further because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices which could increase competition in markets in which we operate   negative publicity could adversely affect our business and operating results   negative publicity about our industry or our company including the quality and reliability of our marketplace effectiveness of the credit decisioning and scoring models used in the marketplace changes to our marketplace our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower and investor complaints privacy and security practices litigation regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers and investors with our marketplace or services even if inaccurate could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in and the use of our marketplace which could harm our business and operating results harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of borrower and investor information and compliance failures and claims   our business is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business   our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal state and local statutes ordinances and regulations in most states in which we operate a consumer credit regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to consumer lenders such as us these rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a consumer lender limitations on the amount duration and charges including interest rates for various categories of loans requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation and restrictions on collection practices and creditors’ rights in certain states we are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities some states in which we operate do not require special licensing or provide extensive regulation of our business   we are also subject to extensive federal regulation including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act these laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against discriminatory lending and leasing practices and unfair credit practices the principal disclosures required under the truth in lending act include the terms of repayment the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each contract or loan the equal credit opportunity act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race color religion national origin sex age or marital status according to regulation b promulgated under the equal credit opportunity act creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection in addition the credit scoring system used by us must comply with the requirements for such a system as set forth in the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b the fair credit reporting act requires us to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency and to respond to consumers who inquire regarding any adverse reporting submitted by us to the consumer reporting agencies additionally we are subject to the grammleachbliley act which requires us to maintain the privacy of certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters we are also subject to the servicemembers civil relief act which requires us in most circumstances to reduce the interest rate charged to customers who have subsequently joined enlisted been inducted or called to active military duty              a material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions lawsuits and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity   the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” is a new federal agency formed pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the “doddfrank act” and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business   the cfpb constituted pursuant to the doddfrank act which commenced operations in  has broad authority over the business in which we engage this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws such as the truth in lending act and the equal credit opportunity act and to enforce those laws against and examine financial institutions for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority to assist in its enforcement the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the loan products we facilitate this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus   we are subject to the cfpb’s jurisdiction including its enforcement authority as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit the cfpb may request reports concerning our organization business conduct markets and activities the cfpb may also conduct onsite examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the cfpb were to determine through its complaint system that we were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers   there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them   actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of the marketplace model or suggest to consumers the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or investors our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the cfpb or other regulators enact new regulations change regulations that were previously adopted modify through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted   if our involvement in a december   article published in the examiner or any other publicity regarding our company or the offering during the waiting period including our december   press release were held to be in violation of federal or state securities laws we could incur monetary damages fines or other damages that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects   on december   information about our company was published in an article by the examiner our chief executive officer mr mathieson did not participate in an interview with the author of the examiner article rather the author included certain quotations from mr mathieson that were contained in prior press releases by us and summarized statements previously made by mr mathieson that were contained in a prior article published by the opportunist magazine prior to its publication the author of the december  th article provided mr mathieson a copy of the article   in addition we issued a press release on december   in which we referenced among other things our intention to file a registration statement on form s and to list our securities on nasdaq the december  nd press release presented certain statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in this private placement memorandum   if it were determined that the december  th article the december  nd press release or any of our other publicityrelated activities constituted a violation of section  of the securities act the sec and relevant state regulators could impose monetary fines or other sanctions as provided under relevant federal and state securities laws such regulators could also require us to make a rescission offer which is an offer to repurchase the notes purchased in this offering this could also give rise to a private right of action to seek a rescission remedy under section a of the securities act   we are unable to quantify the extent of any monetary damages that we might incur if monetary fines were imposed rescission were required or one or more other claims were successful as of the date of this offering memorandum we are not aware of any pending or threatened claims alleging violations of any federal or state securities laws however there can be no assurance that any such claim will not be asserted in the future or that the claimant in any such action will not prevail the possibility that such claims may be asserted in the future will continue until the expiration of the applicable federal and state statutes of limitations which generally vary from one to three years from the date of sale if the payment of damages or fines is significant it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition or prospects              risks relating to our common stock   trading on the otc markets is volatile and sporadic which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock    our common stock is currently quoted on the otcqb tier of the otc markets trading in securities quoted on the otc markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects this volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance moreover the otc markets is not a stock exchange and trading of securities on the otc markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like nasdaq or the new york stock exchange these factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock   our common stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors including a limited public float   the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the future you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to volatility   other factors that could cause such volatility may include among other things     ● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results         ● the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us         ● we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons including that a large portion of our stock is closely held         ● overall stock market fluctuations         ● announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors         ● actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it and to raise such capital on favorable terms         ● conditions or trends in the industry         ● litigation         ● changes in market valuations of other similar companies         ● future sales of common stock         ● departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel and         ● general market conditions   any of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock in addition the stock market in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance              our common stock has been in the past and may be in the future a “penny stock” under sec rules it may be more difficult to resell securities classified as “penny stock”   in the past our common stock has been a “penny stock” under applicable sec rules generally defined as nonexchange traded stock with a pershare price below  unless we maintain a pershare price above  these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as “established customers” or “accredited investors” for example brokerdealers must determine the appropriateness for nonqualifying persons of investments in penny stocks brokerdealers must also provide prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock disclose the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction   legal remedies available to an investor in “penny stocks” may include the following     ● if a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above or other federal or states securities laws the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment         ● if a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages   however investors who have signed arbitration agreements may have to pursue their claims through arbitration   these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our securities which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock   many brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks in addition many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due among other reasons to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments   for these reasons penny stocks may have a limited market and consequently limited liquidity we can give no assurance that our common stock will not become classified as a “penny stock” in the future   if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the price of our securities may be adversely affected   our internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock we are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting failure to establish those controls or any failure of those controls once established could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business prospects financial condition or results of operations in addition management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock   we are required to comply with certain provisions of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and if we fail to continue to comply our business could be harmed and the price of our securities could decline   rules adopted by the sec pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting and for certain issuers but not us an attestation of this assessment by the issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm the standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex and require significant documentation testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards we expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to section  compliance on an ongoing basis it is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis in the event that our chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected however we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and the market value of our securities may be negatively affected

beneficially owned  shares of our common stock which represents   of our outstanding common stock as a result mr mathieson controls a majority of our voting power and therefore is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval mr mathieson may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentrated voting power may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock   as a board member mr mathieson owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder mr mathieson is entitled to vote his shares in his own interest which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally   shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market   from time to time certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all

best interests of our stockholders   provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation as amended and our amended and restated bylaws may be deemed to have antitakeover effects which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called and may delay defer or prevent a takeover attempt in addition certain provisions of the florida business corporations act also may be deemed to have certain antitakeover effects which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporation’s disinterested stockholders further our amended and restated articles of incorporation as amended authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion our board of directors may without stockholder approval issue series of preferred stock with dividends liquidation conversion voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock   as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements   we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to     ● have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act         ● comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis                  ● submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and         ● disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock

losses and ii the company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations however the company has increased its revenue management’s plans for the next  months alleviate the substantial doubt and management evaluates that as a result of these plans the company can meet all its obligations through october  without raising additional debt or equity capital management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations and related loan processing costs there would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional capital being raised management’s plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in loan origination in addition significant core operating costs have been cut from the company in  including reducing the number of employees from  to  due to increased automation of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from  to  in the past quarter as old leases expired while the company has sufficient cash on hand at september   combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to continue operations for at least  months the company intends over the next  months to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and the company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and although not the current plan could seek additional equity capital if required              on august   we through certain of our wholly owned

offbalance sheet arrangements   as of september   and december   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors the term “offbalance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party under which we have any obligation arising under a

risk support for such assets   basis of accounting   these consolidated financial statements include the operations of ieg holdings corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries investment evolution corporation and iec spv llc collectively the “company” all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation   the company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the consumer finance industry   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities   the principal conditionsevents that raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to meet its obligations are i the company has reported recurring losses and ii the company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations however the company has increased its revenue management’s plans for the next  months alleviate the substantial doubt and management evaluates that as a result of these plans the company can meet all its obligations through october  without raising additional debt or equity capital management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations and related loan processing costs there would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional capital being raised management’s plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in loan origination in addition significant core operating costs have been cut from the company in  including reducing the number of employees from  to  due to increased automation of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from  to  in the past quarter as old leases expired while the company has sufficient cash on hand at september   combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to continue operations for at least  months the company intends over the next  months to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and the company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and although not the current plan could seek additional equity capital if required   critical accounting policies   we have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations for all of these policies management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected and the best estimates routinely require adjustment specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures management uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates accordingly actual results may differ from these estimates              loans receivable and interest income   the company offers its loans at or below the prevailing statutory rates loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding net of an allowance for credit losses   the company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method charges for late payments are credited to income when collected   accrual of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for  days or more on a contractual basis at which time a loan is considered delinquent payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the unpaid accrued interest and then principal loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current at which time management believes future payments are reasonably assured at september    loans with a total balance of  were delinquent or in default at december    loans with a total balance of  were delinquent or in default   allowance for credit losses   the company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will not be collected the allowance is estimated by management based on various factors including specific circumstances of the individual loans management’s knowledge of the industry and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry   our portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small homogenous accounts the allowance for credit losses is determined using a systematic methodology based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies and industry index impaired loans are considered separately and  charged off   the allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect management’s judgment regarding overall accuracy we take into account several factors including the customer’s transaction history specifically the timeliness of customer payments the remaining contractual term of the loan and the outstanding balance of the loan   concentration of credit risks   as of september   the company’s portfolio of finance receivables is with consumers living throughout alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana missouri nevada new jersey new mexico oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia and consequently such consumers’ ability to honor their installment contracts may be affected by economic conditions in these areas   the company maintains cash at financial institutions which may at times exceed federally insured limits   impaired loans   the company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is  days past due the company defines impaired loans as bankrupt accounts and accounts that are  days or more past due in accordance with the company’s chargeoff policy once a loan is deemed uncollectible  of the remaining balance is chargedoff loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable due to consumer specific circumstances   the company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit losses changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations   property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation and amortization are being provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows   classification   life computer equipment    years furniture and fixtures    years              the company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives which are generally five years or the lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations   operating leases   the company’s office leases all expire unless renewed during    loan costs   loan costs consisted of broker success fees and legal fees related to the credit facility these costs were amortized over the period of the credit facility   income taxes   we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification “asc”  “income taxes” to date no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns our net deferred income tax assets have been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover our net deferred income tax assets   advertising costs   advertising costs are expensed as incurred   earnings and loss per share   the company computes net earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  that establishes standards for computing and presenting net earnings loss per shares basic earnings loss per share are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares if any had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the for reverse split that occurred on june   and for the net for reverse split that occurred on october     reclassifications   certain numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation   fair value of financial instruments   carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their immediate or shortterm nature the fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions   recent accounting pronouncements   the recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standardssetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption              description of business   business overview   we provide unsecured online consumer loans under the brand name “mr amazing loans” via our website and online application portal at wwwmramazingloanscom  we started our business and opened our first office in las vegas nevada in  we currently offer  and  unsecured consumer loans that mature in five years we are currently licensed and originating direct consumer loans in  states – alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana maryland missouri nevada new jersey new mexico ohio oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia we provide loans to residents of these states through our online application portal with all loans originated processed and serviced out of our centralized las vegas head office which eliminates the need for physical offices in all of these states   our strategy is to address the funding needs of “underbanked” consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional credit providers such as traditional banks and credit unions and charged high advanced fees and interest by fringe lenders such as payday lenders in the current economic environment we believe there is a substantial need for the small personal loans that we offer   all of our personal loans are offered at less than prevailing maximum statutory rates with fixed repayments and no prepayment penalties we conduct full underwriting on all applications including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have the capacity to repay their loans   we plan to continue expanding our state coverage by obtaining state lending licenses in an additional six states increasing our coverage to  states by mid as soon as we receive new state licenses we are prepared to refocus our existing online marketing and distribution channel resources to those states which we expect will continue to lower our average customer acquisition cost   for the years ended december   and  we generated revenue of  and  respectively and had net losses of  and  respectively for the nine months ended september   and  we generated revenue of  and  respectively and had net losses of  and  respectively   we were organized as a florida corporation on january   originally under the name interact technologies inc in february  we changed our name to ieg holdings corporation we have two whollyowned subsidiaries iec our us operating entity that holds all of our state licenses leases employee contracts and other operating and administrative assets and iec spv a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that holds our us loan receivables   market   we operate in the consumer finance industry serving the large and growing population of consumers who have limited access to credit from banks credit card companies and other lenders according to the federal deposit insurance corporation   in  of households in the united states were unbanked in  this proportion represented nearly  million households according to the center for financial services december  report the rapid rise of short term credit which grew  from  to  while single payment credit grew only  over the same period is starkly apparent with anticipated regulatory changes likely to alter the feasibility of offering loans due in one lump sum many companies are investing more heavily in installmentbased credit products while new players are seeking to upend the economics of smalldollar loans through online channels and alternative underwriting the strong marketing and new account approval rates of subprime credit cards have also provided consumers with increased access to funds available on a shortterm basis together these shifts in the consumer lending industry suggest that total revenue for short term credit products sized at  billion in  will soon outpace that of single payment credit products sized at  billion for the same year in fact short term credit products already generate nearly twice as much annual revenue as single payment credit products   installment lending to nonprime consumers is one of the most highly fragmented sectors of the consumer finance industry we are a statelicensed internetbased personal loan company serving in the consumer installment lending industry our online lending platform provides the distribution network to efficiently address this growing market of consumers without the significant costs and overhead associated with an extensive branch network we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity created by the continued shift of consumers to online services such as online banking and in our case online personal loans

state in october     ohio was added as a licensed state in december    business strategy   our business strategy is to lower the cost of providing consumer loans by leveraging our online lending platform and distribution network while continuing to obtain additional state licenses to enable further loan book growth and portfolio diversification our strategy includes a number of key elements     ● statelicensed model our statelicensed business model is a key element of our business strategy we are currently licensed in alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana maryland missouri nevada new jersey new mexico ohio oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia and plan to continue expanding across the united states by acquiring additional state lending licenses         ● online distribution we launched online lending in march  and commenced online advertising in july  upon fulfillment of state regulatory requirements we received approval from regulators in alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana maryland missouri nevada new jersey new mexico ohio oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia to operate solely online in these states this allows us to fully service all  states from our centralized las vegas headquarters which we believe is a key competitive advantage over brick and mortar lenders         ● costeffective customer acquisition our customer acquisition costs have been reduced significantly since we launched online lending and marketing while traditional forms of direct advertising such as radio and television typically resulted in an  to  acquisition cost online search engine advertising has averaged  to          ● continue to grow loan book total cumulative loan originations as of september   have increased  to  since our january  total of  this growth in lending is attributable to launching online lending and joint venturing with a number of new marketing partners however such past growth is not necessarily indicative or predictive of our future results of operation we also plan to obtain an additional six state lending licenses by mid   competitive strengths   we believe our competitive strengths are     ● large market and scope for growth large personal and payday loan market in the united states presents opportunity for significant growth and expansion         ● proven business model our founder chairman and ceo paul mathieson established a similar business in australia that forms the foundation of our united states business model         ● regulation we are materially compliant with state lending licenses in alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana maryland missouri nevada new jersey new mexico ohio oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia and are well positioned for current and future regulatory changes due to ongoing compliance and conservative business model                ● customer proposition our unsecured  and  installment loans are all offered over five years and feature affordable weekly repayments rates range from    apr which make us a low cost alternative to payday loans which have an average apr of over          ● online distribution special approval has been granted by the alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana maryland missouri nevada new jersey new mexico ohio oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia regulators to operate our business without a physical office location in each state as a result we have closed offices in arizona illinois and florida and moved to full online loan distribution enabling us to offer loans to residents in all  of our licensed states from our las vegas headquarters we will apply for the same regulatory approval for our six additional planned states by mid         ● customer acquisition we launched online advertising in july  with positive results from search engine cost per click advertising and online lead generation in addition we engaged a number of new marketing partners in  and  including online lead generators and direct mail all of these avenues provide opportunities for strong growth at low customer acquisition costs         ● barriers to entry we believe that state licensure acts as a barrier to entry into our segment of the consumer loan market we are strongly positioned with approval to operate under  state licenses from one centralized head office   products   we currently provide  and  online consumer loans unsecured over a fiveyear term with rates ranging from  to  annual percentage rate our current loan portfolio also includes loans remaining from our previous product offerings which were  to  loans unsecured over a three to fiveyear term   our personal loan products are fully amortizing fixed rate unsecured installment loans and all loans are offered at prevailing statutory rates with our standard loan product being a  interest rate and annual percentage rate fully amortizing fiveyear unsecured personal loan the variations from this standard loan product in certain states is due to individual state requirements and to comply with our state lending licenses for example florida requires a blended rate which caps the maximum rate on a  loan at    the following is a breakdown of loan terms and interest rates for each currently licensed state   state   apr

advertising   loan underwriting   applicants apply online providing income employment and banking information in the preapproval process the preapproval process utilizes a soft credit pull electronic review of  day banking history and if the applicant successfully meets the minimum preapproval criteria they are invited to proceed upon accepting the conditional preapproval the applicant authorizes a full credit report from experian and verification of employment applicants are provided disclosures and privacy statements during this process   once the application has been transmitted a full credit report is obtained and the automated preliminary underwriting is completed based on stated income and expense data obtained from the credit report the automated preliminary underwriting includes but is not limited to credit score number of credit inquiries outstanding unpaid collections length of credit history length of employment debt to income ratio and internet protocol or “ip” address to verify location of applicant   the second step in the underwriting process for those applicants that are conditionally approved based on stated income credit score number of credit inquires outstanding unpaid collections length of credit history and length of employments debt to income ratio ip address is to validate the actual income current pay invoices and prior year w and a review of the  day readonly statements from the applicant’s primary bank for satisfactory money management during this process the pay invoices are reviewed for garnishments hardship loans and other legal liens allowed on wages bank statements are transmitted electronically directly to underwriting to ensure the integrity of the information this process allows the underwriter to review the money management of every applicant and to assess the ability to take on additional expense it also provides the underwriter with additional debt not found on traditional credit reports such as payday loans title loans and irs payments that could affect the ability of the applicant to assume additional debt if all conditions are met as it relates to money management maximum debt to income minimum length of employment and satisfactory credit history the underwriter recommends final approval and request to draw documents   the final step in the underwriting process is to present the completed file to the chief credit officer for final approval and order to draw documents the file is then reviewed for any exceptions to policy compliance with the underwriting policies and to ensure the loan system is reflective of what has been presented by the underwriter the applicant is then approved for a  or  loan based on income ability to repay and credit strength rate and loan terms are fixed fixed rate and fixed term can vary based on regulatory state maximums as we do not utilize risk based variable pricing models eliminating the risk of discrimination and other compliance related issues   the closing process is completed by contacting the applicant communicating the lending decision and reviewing loan terms and conditions upon acceptance an identity check using experian’s precise identity screening is completed and if successful loan documents are emailed for electronic signature and returned to us for final verifications document review and funding   servicing   all of our loan servicing is handled in our centralized las vegas head office all servicing and collection activity is conducted and documented using an industry standard loan service software system which handles

consumer loan software to us we use this software for our loan management system we have a servicing agreement with cyberridge llc which renews automatically unless either party notifies the other at least  days prior to the end of the renewal term we believe the risk of termination is low as we are a paying customer of cyberridge llc and have maintained a positive working relationship since  in the unlikely event that the agreement was terminated we believe  days’ notice would be sufficient to find a suitable replacement with minimal disruption to our business              portfolio ledger

accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ieg holdings corporation and subsidiaries as of december   and  and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended ieg holdings corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit   we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards established by the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement we were not engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion   in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of ieg holdings corporation and subsidiaries as of december   and  and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as discussed in note  to the consolidated financial statements the company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management’s plans regarding those matters also are described in note  the

consumer finance industry   going concern   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern the company has reported recurring losses and has not generated positive net cash flows from operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company is increasing its revenue and management intends to seek additional capital sufficient to continue operations if the

to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result should the company not continue as a going

collected   accrual of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for  days or more on a contractual basis at which time a loan is considered delinquent payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the unpaid accrued interest and then principal loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current at which time management believes future payments are reasonably assured at december    loans with a total balance of  were delinquent or in default   allowance for credit losses   the company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will not be collected the allowance is estimated by management based on various factors including specific circumstances of the individual loans management’s knowledge of the industry and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry   our portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small homogenous accounts the allowance for credit losses is determined using a systematic methodology based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies impaired loans are considered separately and  charged off   the allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect management’s judgment regarding overall accuracy we take into account several factors including the customer’s transaction history specifically the timeliness of customer payments the remaining contractual term of the loan and the outstanding balance of the loan   impaired loans   the company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is  days past due the company defines impaired loans as bankrupt accounts and accounts that are  days or more past due in accordance with the company’s chargeoff policy once a loan is deemed uncollectible  of the remaining balance is chargedoff loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable due to consumer specific circumstances

and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations   operating leases   the company’s office leases all expire unless renewed during    loan costs   loan costs consisted of broker success fees and legal fees related to the credit facility these costs were amortized over the period of the credit facility accumulated amortization of loan costs amounted to  and  at december

to date no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns our net deferred income tax assets have been fully reserved by a valuation allowance

shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares if any had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the for reverse split that occurred on june   and the net for reverse split that occurred on october     reclassifications   certain numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation   fair value of financial instruments   the company has adopted guidance issued by the fasb that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with existing generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value the categories are as follows     level i inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date         level ii inputs other than quoted prices included in level i that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date         level iii unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date   at december   and  the only financial instruments that are subject to these classifications are cash and cash equivalents which are considered level i assets   carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for other receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their immediate or shortterm nature the fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions      f

the company’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   as filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on february   as contemplated by the sec under article  of regulation sx the accompanying financial statements and footnotes have been condensed and therefore do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles the interim financial data are unaudited however in the opinion of ieg holdings corporation “we “our” “us” the interim data includes all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year   nature of business   the principal business activity of the company is providing unsecured  and  consumer loans over a fiveyear term through its subsidiaries investment evolution corporation and iec spv llc the loans are offered under the consumer brand “mr amazing loans” the company is headquartered in las vegas nevada and originates consumer loans in the states of alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana missouri nevada new jersey new mexico oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia via its online platform and distribution network the company is a licensed direct lender with state licenses andor certificates of authority to lend in these  states and offers all loans within the prevailing statutory rates   basis of accounting   these consolidated financial statements include the operations of ieg holdings corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries investment evolution corporation and iec spv llc collectively the “company” all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation   the company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the consumer finance industry   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect any possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities   liquidity   the principal conditionsevents that raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to meet its obligations are i the company has reported recurring losses and ii the company has not yet generated positive net cash flows from operations however the company has increased its revenue management’s plans for the next  months alleviate the substantial doubt and management evaluates that as a result of these plans the company can meet all its obligations through october  without raising additional debt or equity capital management’s plans include reducing advertising costs to significantly reduce loan originations and related loan processing costs there would also be a significant reduction in consulting and professional fees without additional capital being raised management’s plans also include utilizing the funds received from loan principal repayments for operating expenses rather than investing in loan origination in addition significant core operating costs have been cut from the company in  including reducing the number of employees from  to  due to increased automation of loan origination processes and reducing the number of office leases from  to  in the past quarter as old leases expired while the company has sufficient cash on hand at september   combined with anticipated cash flow from loan repayments to continue operations for at least  months the company intends over the next  months to seek additional capital via unsecured notes to expand operations and the company has shown the capacity to raise substantial equity capital over the past few years and although not the current plan could seek additional equity capital if required      f            ieg holdings corporation notes to condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements september     use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures management uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making these estimates accordingly actual results may differ from these estimates   cash and cash equivalents   for the purpose of the statement of cash flows the company considers cash equivalents to include shortterm highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less   loans receivable and interest income   the company is licensed to originate consumer loans in the states of alabama arizona california florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana missouri nevada new jersey new mexico oregon pennsylvania texas utah and virginia during the nine months ended september   and  the company originated  and  loans over a five year term the company offers its loans at or below the prevailing statutory rates loans are carried at the unpaid principal amount outstanding net of an allowance for credit losses   the company calculates interest revenue using the interest yield method charges for late payments are credited to income when collected   accrual of interest income on loans receivable is suspended when no payment has been received on account for  days or more on a contractual basis at which time a loan is considered delinquent payments received on nonaccrual financing loans are first applied to the unpaid accrued interest and then principal loans are returned to active status and accrual of interest income is resumed when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current at which time management believes future payments are reasonably assured at september    loans with a total balance of  were delinquent or in default   allowance for credit losses   the company maintains an allowance for credit losses due to the fact that it is probable that a portion of the loans receivable will not be collected the allowance is estimated by management based on various factors including specific circumstances of the individual loans management’s knowledge of the industry and the experience and trends of other companies in the same industry   our portfolio of loans receivable consists of a large number of relatively small homogenous accounts the allowance for credit losses is determined using a systematic methodology based on a combination of historical bad debt of comparable companies impaired loans are considered separately and  charged off   the allowance for credit losses is primarily based upon models that analyze specific portfolio statistics and also reflect management’s judgment regarding overall accuracy we take into account several factors including the customer’s transaction history specifically the timeliness of customer payments the remaining contractual term of the loan and the outstanding balance of the loan   impaired loans   the company assesses loans for impairment individually when a loan is  days past due the company defines impaired loans as bankrupt accounts and accounts that are  days or more past due in accordance with the company’s chargeoff policy once a loan is deemed uncollectible  of the remaining balance is chargedoff loans can also be charged off when deemed uncollectable due to consumer specific circumstances   the company does not accrue interest on impaired loans and any recoveries of impaired loans are recorded to the allowance for credit losses changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statement of operations      f            ieg

being provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows   classification     life   computer equipment      years   furniture and fixtures      years     the company amortizes its leasehold improvements over the shorter of their economic lives which are generally five years or the lease term that considers renewal periods that are reasonably assured expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations   operating lease   the company’s office lease in las vegas expires unless renewed on september     income taxes   we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification “asc”  “income taxes” to date no current income tax liability has been recorded due to our accumulated net losses deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts that are reported in the income tax returns our net deferred income tax assets have been fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income and to recover our net deferred income tax assets   advertising costs   advertising costs are expensed as incurred advertising costs amounted to  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively advertising costs amounted to  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively   earnings and loss per share   the company computes net earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  that establishes standards for computing and presenting net earnings loss per shares basic earnings loss per share are computed by dividing net income loss attributed to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares if any had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted retroactively for the for reverse split that occurred on june   and for the net for reverse split that occurred on october     reclassifications   certain numbers from the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation   fair value of financial instruments   the company has adopted guidance issued by the fasb that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with existing generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value the categories are as follows     ● level i – inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date         ● level ii – inputs other than quoted prices included in level i that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date         ● level iii – unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date      f            ieg holdings corporation notes to condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements september     at september   and  the only financial instruments that are subject to these classifications are cash and cash equivalents which are considered level i assets   carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for other receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their immediate or shortterm nature the fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different than its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and
