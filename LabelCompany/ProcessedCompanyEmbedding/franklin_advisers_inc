the commission is a party and without admitting or denying the findings except those findings pertaining to the jurisdiction of the commission over them and the subject matter of these proceedings respondents consent to the entry of this order instituting administrative and ceaseanddesist proceedings making findings and imposing remedial sanctions and a ceaseanddesist order pursuant to sections e and k of the investment advisers act of  sections b and f of the investment company act of  and section b of the securities exchange act of  order as set forth below iii on the basis of this order and respondents offer the commission finds that respondents  fa is an investment adviser registered with the commission and headquartered in san mateo california fa provides investment advisory portfolio management and administrative services to a majority though not all of the mutual funds in the franklin templeton investments complex as of january   fa had  billion in assets under management  ftdi is a brokerdealer registered with the commission and headquartered in st petersburg florida ftdi provides sales and marketing services and acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of most of the usregistered mutual funds in the franklin templeton investments complex ftdi earns fees and commissions in connection with the sale of the ft fund shares summary  between  and  franklin templeton investments franklin or ft a global mutual fund complex entered into inadequately disclosed agreements with  brokerdealer firms pursuant to those agreements ft used  million in brokerage commissions which were fund assets  to compensate those brokerdealers for providing preferential marketing of the funds the use of fund brokerage commissions in lieu of cash payments by ftdi for these marketing arrangements created potential conflicts of interest that should have been but were not adequately disclosed to the ft fund boards of directors and ft fund shareholders these agreements with the brokerdealers known as shelf space agreements bought placement on certain brokerdealers lists of recommended mutual funds and on the brokersdealers websites among other things the objective in entering into the shelf space agreements was to increase sales of the ft funds  ftdi the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of most of the ft mutual funds negotiated the terms of the shelf space arrangements and attempted to have each brokerdealer receive the amount contemplated in its agreement with ftdi fa which provides investment advisory portfolio management and administrative services to a majority of the ft mutual funds had the duty to inform the fund directors and shareholders of potential conflicts of interest  fa aided and abetted by ftdi failed to adequately disclose that the shelf space arrangements shifted marketing expenses from ftdi to fund shareholders they also failed to disclose that if the shelf space agreements successfully increased fund sales fa would benefit from an increase in its compensation which was calculated as a percentage of total assets under management in addition because ftdi asked fts traders to meet specific directed brokerage targets for certain brokerdealers ft risked executing trades in a manner inconsistent with shareholder interests finally without knowledge of these agreements the boards were unable adequately to evaluate the funds overall marketing expenses and other issues  by engaging in the inadequately disclosed practice of using fund assets for shelf space fa and ftdi violated the securities laws fa and ftdi also violated the law by not ensuring that the commission payments for shelf space were assets of the specific fund promoted by the brokerdealer as a result some funds may have been improperly disadvantaged in that the assets of those funds were used for the benefit of other funds ftdi used brokerage commissions to pay for shelf space  between january  and the end of  ftdi negotiated shelf space agreements with banks and brokerdealers under these agreements ftdi agreed to pay the brokerdealers for heightened access to the brokerdealers distribution or sales systems the heightened access included placement of certain franklin funds on the brokers websites and lists of preferred mutual funds access to brokers participation in broker conferences and other advantages senior ftdi officers negotiated these deals for ftdi  for the period  through  ftdi sent  brokerdealers a total of  million in brokerage commissions directed as a credit for shelf space arrangements when the ft traders directed brokerage to the brokerdealers with whom they had shelf space agreements commissions on mutual fund portfolio trades were used to offset shelf space payments these brokerage commissions were fund assets ftdi made some payments in cash but cash payments were an expense to ftdi so ftdi preferred to avoid the cost through the use of directed brokerage this use of commissions created potential conflicts of interest that needed to be adequately disclosed  when ftdi paid for shelf space with brokerage commissions it did so according to a ratio calculation if for example the shelf space agreement contemplated that ftdi would pay  in cash to a brokerdealer for fund sales and assets some brokerdealers would allow ftdi to satisfy the agreement with  in brokerage commissions pursuant to an agreed ratio of  if the brokerage commission payments did not cover the specified amount for shelf space ftdi would pay the balance in cash it was more beneficial for ftdi to pay for shelf space with brokerage commissions than cash because ftdi was able to avoid using its own assets for the marketing expense  fa also benefited from the payment of directed brokerage commissions for shelf space agreements insofar as increased fund sales generated increased assets under management which in turn generated increased management fees for fa  ftdi tracked compliance with the shelf space agreements most of which were oral though still definite and specific ftdi recorded the terms and brokerage targets on a spreadsheet identifying all the brokerdealers who had agreed to accept brokerage in lieu of hard cash payments fts trading department established targets for brokerage commissions that would be directed to the various brokerdealers pursuant to the negotiated agreements as the year progressed the targets were circulated to the ft trading department as a monthly update showing progress toward the shelf space targets toward the end of the year these reports were distributed weekly rather than monthly to ensure that the traders received uptodate information on target completion toward the end of the fiscal year the ftdi account managers responsible for maintaining specific brokerdealer relationships would sometimes tell the ft trading department that they were short of reaching that years brokerage target for one of the brokerdealers they would ask the ft traders to direct more brokerage to that brokerdealer in order to meet the target and subject to best execution the ft traders were generally able to comply the traders were aware of the targets and ftdis progress in meeting them when allocating their trades the inadequately disclosed shelf space payments created potential conflicts of interest  between  and late  fa did not adequately disclose to the ft boards and ft shareholders that brokerage commissions were being used as a credit for shelf space as a fiduciary responsible for informing the ft boards of important matters and approving the funds written disclosures to ft shareholders fa had a duty to ensure adequate disclosures were made  the boards were not specifically advised of the practice of paying for shelf space with directed brokerage and were never made aware of several potential conflicts of interest including that ftdi had a choice about whether to pay for the shelf space from its own assets or the funds assets and that fa stood to profit from higher fees resulting from increased assets under management as a result the boards were unable to adequately evaluate the funds overall marketing expenses in approving the funds marketing plans as required by the commission pursuant to rule b because they were not given the opportunity to approve the practice of using fund assets to pay for shelf space the boards could not adequately evaluate whether this use of fund assets was in accordance with the best interests of the ft shareholders nor could they evaluate the funds overall marketing expenses  the shelf space arrangements also were not adequately disclosed to the ft shareholders fa was responsible for ensuring that the disclosures made in the funds prospectuses and statements of additional information sais accurately described how ftdi chose the brokerdealers with which it worked item c of the secs form na requires a description in the sai of how the fund will select brokers to effect securities transactions in the fund and requires that if the fund will consider the receipt of products or services other than brokerage or research services in selecting brokers the fund should specify those products or services  in the dealer compensation section of its sais ft disclosed in pertinent part distributors andor its affiliates may provide financial support to securities dealers that sell share of franklin templeton investments this support is based primarily on the amount of sales of fund shares andor total assets with franklin templeton investments the amount of support may be affected by total sales net sales levels of redemptions the proportion of a securities dealers sales and marketing efforts in franklin templeton investments a securities dealers sales and marketing efforts in franklin templeton investments a securities dealers support of and participation in distributors marketing programs a securities dealers compensation programs for its registered representatives and the extent of a securities dealers marketing programs relating to franklin templeton investments financial support to securities dealers may be made by payments from distributors own resources from distributors retention of underwriting concessions and in the case of funds that have rule b plans from payments to distributors under such plans in addition certain securities dealers may receive brokerage commissions generated by fund portfolio transactions in accordance with the rules of the national association of securities dealers inc the portfolio transactions section of fts sais sates in pertinent part if the funds officers are satisfied that the best execution is obtained the sale of fund shares as well as shares of other funds in franklin templeton investments also may be considered a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute the funds portfolio transactions although the sais stated that ft could consider a brokerdealers sales of fund shares when selecting a brokerdealer to execute portfolio transactions they did not describe ftdis practice of annually negotiating shelf space arrangements with certain brokerdealers they did not make clear to fund shareholders that brokerage commissions were used to offset shelf space payment obligations under at least some of these shelf space arrangements they also did not make clear that use of brokerage payments in this manner was not specifically authorized by the funds distribution plans approved by the ft fund boards pursuant to rule b respondents engaged in improper joint arrangements  each time ft directed a funds brokerage commissions to obtain credit for the shelf space arrangements they made no effort to ensure that these commissions came from the specific fund promoted by the brokerdealer in connection with a shelf space arrangement accordingly respondents made no efforts to ensure that the directed brokerage commissions from any given fund were used to promote the sale of that fund as opposed to the sale of other funds as a result some funds may have been improperly disadvantaged in that the assets of those funds were used for the benefit of other funds ftdi and fa thus participated in a joint distribution arrangement whereby they improperly pooled and directed brokerage from the ft funds respondents remedial actions

continued to pay for shelf space with cash payments from ftdi violations  as a result of the conduct described above fa  willfully violated section  of the advisers act which provides that it is
