yielding sustainable returns to stakeholders we aim to secure thaibev’s leadership position as the largest beverage company in southeast asia and generate sustainable return for shareholders by developing innovative products diversifying our portfolio leveraging our efficient distribution network in core markets and expanding our business in southeast asia through our collaboration with fraser and neave limited “fn” singapore’s leading beverage producer and distributor as well as publisher we are strengthening our foundation for sustainable growth in the future diversity attaining business sustainability from diversified revenue streams is core to our plan this involves increasing income contribution from our nonalcoholic beverage segment and overseas sales our expansion into the nonalcoholic beverage market is an important part of our strategy to become the leading total beverage producer and distributor in the region we focus on offering a more diversified product portfolio and optimizing our distribution network thaibev’s expansion into the nonalcoholic beverage segment commenced in  with the acquisition of oishi group public company limited “oishi” – the no  green tea beverage producer in thailand thereafter we acquired sermsuk public company limited “sermsuk” – the beverage producer with the most extensive distribution network in thailand – in  and fn a leading singapore company in the beverage publishing and printing industries in  in our pursuit of overseas expansion we view asean countries as highgrowth markets purchasing power in these markets which have a total population of over  million people is increasing amid the growth of their economies and the rise in the numbers of investors and tourists to the country beverages from thailand have high growth potential in these markets consumer behavior in asean countries especially cambodia lao pdr myanmar and vietnam has been strongly influenced by the popularity of thai media broadcasts singers and superstars in these countries as well as their substantial native labour force working in thailand furthermore thaibev’s alliance with fn has opened up many opportunities for joint investment in asean we have adapted successful business models from thailand malaysia and singapore for other countries while fostering further cooperation to optimize brand and distribution synergies for instance oishi successfully penetrated the myanmar market by collaborating with fn’s branch offices in the country moreover we leveraged fraser and neave holding berhad’s robust production facilities in malaysia for our expansion into other halal markets in southeast asia brand in  we reorganized thaibev’s management structure and streamlined our core businesses into three product groups – spirits beer and nonalcoholic beverage we also identified the core products of each business namely “ruangkhao” “hongthong” “blend ” “chang” beer “est” soft drinks “oishi” green tea and “plus” in the year  we furthered our success through continued product innovation and the introduction of more modern packaging in line with our premiumization strategy our efforts in the spirits product group were focused on the development of thaibev’s flagship “hongthong” brand which has been the no  brand in the brown spirits category and “blend ” brand through music campaigns as well as product premiumization these help us to ensure that thaibev serves consumers in all segments moreover we revamped the labels of “blend  signature” and “meridian” brandy to give them a more glamorous and international image customer feedback following the revamp has been positive and the sales volume of both brands have increased in late  we began launching our scotch whiskies such as “old pulteney” and “ancnoc” as well as our “caorunn” gin in luxury hotels and restaurants in thailand for the beer product group “chang classic” in the new emerald green bottle and a champagne gold label has received greater feedback than expected representing a major step on our path towards realizing vision  and becoming the top leader in thailand’s beer market and achieve significant growth in southeast asia in addition the label of “archa” beer has been revamped to be more beautiful and modern to realize our potential and secure our market leadership in the nonalcoholic beverage segment we constantly introduce innovative healthy products that best meet the taste and preferences of consumers of all ages from all walks of life and in all moments of daily life new products launched in  include oishi “kyoho grape” as well as oishi “sakura strawberry” which featured innovative packaging that changes color when chilled meanwhile sermsuk launched est play “grape berry” and “korean orange cola” to create a sensation in the carbonated soft drink market sermsuk also expanded the production base of “crystal” drinking water which has been certified by nsf international usa as a quality product with high standards in addition the design of bottles used for “crystal” drinking water was refreshed to give the product a more modern look and use thinner plastic reach our robust and extensive distribution network is one of our major strengths and also a key factor that elevated thaibev to attain its leadership position in thailand’s beverage market we currently have more than  delivery trucks which reach over  outlets across the country as well as longstanding relationships with agents distributors and restaurants we have also established over  direct sales teams to provide sales services and manage the visibility of our products on store shelves in  we reinforced our domestic distribution network by establishing modern trade management co ltd to distribute thaibev’s alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages to modern trade operators in  we founded horeca management co ltd “horeca” to close gaps in our distribution channels to luxury hotels and restaurants and provide us with the benefits of complete coverage of the segment and to introduce our overseas premium products to the upmarket onpremise segment in thailand in  we established cash van management co ltd to manage our direct sales teams which support around  retailers across thailand with our routetomarket and distribution strength through horeca we were able to make our “mekhong” brown spirits available in more than  luxury hotels and restaurants in  our premium spirits from scotland were also made available in more than  outlets nationwide besides enhancing thaibev’s own distribution network we also always seek opportunities to collaborate with local business alliances in asean markets in order to solidify our position as the leading fullscale beverage company in the region and become a truly stable and sustainable business professionalism one of the key aspects that drives the business towards vison  is people thaibev is determined to continue building the team of each product group to have a variety of skill sets and collaborate efficiently this will be most beneficial to the operation and enhance the potential of the group in the long run in  thaibev invested in workforce with knowledge and competencies that enable them to be more capable professionals and further develop their potential for example we launched “project rocket” to groom talented employees that are under  years of age and ready to be devoloped towards future executives other projects were scholarships to be enhance employees’ knowledge experiences and competencies and “thailandscotland staff exchange programme” to give employees an opportunity to gain overseas experience and exchange knowledge on spirits production techniques so that they could further develop the business for
