responsibility your basket is empty print empty creating choices for women creating opportunities for goldcorp the logic is simple any business will be better positioned to succeed if it can make full use of the talents and capabilities of its entire workforce thats why we created creating choices a development training and mentoring initiative for women at goldcorp the principles behind the program are the same ones that guide us in all our initiatives goldcorp wants everyone to contribute and we are focused on supporting and developing our people drawing on the power of shared experience and mutual support our creating choices program brings together small groups of female staff at our operating sites and corporate offices the program is inclusive so regardless of role or rank any woman at goldcorp can participate and every woman will be welcomed the program is voluntary – a tremendous way to build informal networks – and once it gets going virtually selfsufficient creating choices is also selfcontained as participants in each group including the leaders all come from the same site or office goldcorp knows how to add value creating choices was developed by goldcorp and it includes as its learning component taking the stage® a program developed by the humphrey group that helps women develop a confident presence creating choices was launched in vancouver

pueblo viejo alumbrera leagold and nuevaunión  adjusted operating cash flows comprises goldcorps share of operating cash flows before working capital changes calculated on an attributable basis to include the companys share of alumbrera pueblo viejo leagold and nuevaunións operating cash flows before working capital changes the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with gaap the company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the companys performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated financial statements to goldcorps share of adjusted operating cash flows three months ended june   millions   net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations   change in working capital   adjusted operating cash flows provided by pueblo viejo alumbrera leagold and nuevaunión   goldcorps share of adjusted operating cash flows    cash costs by product per ounce and aisc per ounce are nongaap financial performance measures cash costs byproduct total cash costs byproduct incorporate goldcorps share of all production costs including adjustments to inventory carrying values adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the companys closed mines which are noncash in nature and include goldcorps share of byproduct silver lead zinc and copper credits and treatment and refining charges included within revenue additionally cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the companys commodity and foreign currency contracts which the company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in byproduct metal prices heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates which may impact the companys operating costs in addition to conventional measures the company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes the byproduct credits and operating costs fluctuations such that the noncontrollable and controllable variability is independently addressed the company uses total cash costs by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally including operating cash costs as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets the company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the companys underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of byproduct credits on the companys cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the companys operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow when deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold the company includes byproduct credits as the company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the byproduct sales incidental to the gold production process thereby allowing the companys management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production the company reports total cash costs byproduct on a gold ounces sold basis in the gold mining industry this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning the company follows the recommendations of the gold institute production cost standard the gold institute which ceased operations in  was a nonregulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products the production cost standard developed by the gold institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies aisc aisc include total production cash costs incurred at the companys mining operations which forms the basis of the companys byproduct cash costs additionally the company includes sustaining capital expenditures corporate administrative expense minesite exploration and evaluation costs and reclamation cost accretion and amortization the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations therefore growth capital is excluded certain other cash expenditures including nonsustaining expenditures tax payments dividends and financing costs are also excluded the company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations and provides the company and other stakeholders of the company with additional information of the companys operational performance and ability to generate cash flows aisc as a key performance measure allows the company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows this information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions the company reports aisc on a gold ounces sold basis this performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry however this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the company follows the guidance note released by the world gold council which became effective january   the world gold council is a nonregulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies the following tables provide a reconciliation of total cash costs by

nuevaunión  adjusted operating cash flows comprises goldcorps share of operating cash flows before working capital changes calculated on an attributable basis to include the companys share of alumbrera pueblo viejo leagold and nuevaunións operating cash flows before working capital changes the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with gaap the company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the companys performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated financial statements to goldcorps share of adjusted operating cash flows   three months ended june   millions   net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations   change in working capital   adjusted operating cash flows provided by pueblo viejo alumbrera leagold and nuevaunión   goldcorps share of adjusted operating cash flows      cash costs by product per ounce and aisc per ounce are nongaap financial performance measures cash costs byproduct total cash costs byproduct incorporate goldcorps share of all production costs including adjustments to inventory carrying values adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the companys closed mines which are noncash in nature and include goldcorps share of byproduct silver lead zinc and copper credits and treatment and refining charges included within revenue additionally cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the companys commodity and foreign currency contracts which the company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in byproduct metal prices heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates which may impact the companys operating costs in addition to conventional measures the company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes the byproduct credits and operating costs fluctuations such that the noncontrollable and controllable variability is independently addressed the company uses total cash costs by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally including operating cash costs as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets the company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the companys underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of byproduct credits on the companys cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the companys operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow when deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold the company includes byproduct credits as the company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the byproduct sales incidental to the gold production process thereby allowing the companys management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production the company reports total cash costs byproduct on a gold ounces sold basis in the gold mining industry this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning the company follows the recommendations of the gold institute production cost standard the gold institute which ceased operations in  was a nonregulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products the production cost standard developed by the gold institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies aisc aisc include total production cash costs incurred at the companys mining operations which forms the basis of the companys byproduct cash costs additionally the company includes sustaining capital expenditures corporate administrative expense minesite exploration and evaluation costs and reclamation cost accretion and amortization the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations therefore growth capital is excluded certain other cash expenditures including nonsustaining expenditures tax payments dividends and financing costs are also excluded the company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations and provides the company and other stakeholders of the company with additional information of the companys operational performance and ability to generate cash flows aisc as a key performance measure allows the company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows this information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions the company reports aisc on a gold ounces sold basis this performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry however this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the company follows the guidance note released by the world gold council which became effective january   the world gold council is a nonregulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies the following tables provide a reconciliation of total cash costs by
