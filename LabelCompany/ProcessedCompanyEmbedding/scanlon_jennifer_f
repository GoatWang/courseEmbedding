quarter matt will then review the firstquarter financial results for the corporation and the business segments jenny will close with discussions surrounding an update on our strategic initiatives and then well open the call for questions as always we ask our participants to limit themselves to one question to get as many people an opportunity to participate in the call as possible so with that ill turn the call over to jenny scanlon jennifer f scanlon  usg corp thanks ryan and good morning im pleased to talk to you today about our firstquarter results and im also eager to share the progress weve made on some of the strategic priorities we previously outlined but first i want to make three overarching comments number one we have an operationally sound quarter with a  yearonyear revenue increase and weve realized a  wallboard price increase we are operationally sound however a sharp uptick in key raw materials detracted from our margins which we expect to abate as we move into the balance of the year and then additionally we have to bear in mind that we are comping against a very strong first quarter last year second i continue to be really optimistic about the health of our industry this year we are seeing solid organic growth for our products given our observed continued strength in household formation and wage growth along with homebuilder confidence and commercial stability i feel better about our endmarkets than i did  days ago and in fact the healthy levels of true organic demand have led us to add people to serve our customers in the best possible manner and third i believe in our reinvestment strategy we are investing in lowering our costs and were investing in seeding future growth and were also returning capital to shareholders youll hear more today about our advanced manufacturing program as well as the launch of our next generation of sheetrock brand ultralight wallboard named ecosmart and youll hear about the progress weve made on our share buyback program because of these three overarching themes operationally sound industry optimism and reinvestment for future strength i believe that our performance and our outlook outweigh the cost challenges that we face during this first quarter and these are cost challenges that were actively mitigating and we do expect to abate throughout the year and now before i turn it over to matt i would like to reiterate a comment that i made on our last call i said that the transition of the lw business was exceeding my expectations and im repeating that message again this morning youll remember that we established a supply agreement to ensure an orderly transition for both parties and i continue to be pleased with how this supply agreement is framing the continued strong relationship that we have with lw and equally important weve been able to increase our business with other existing customers and also add a number of new customers so these are all important factors to consider as you review our quarter and now im going to turn it over to matt to cover the numbers in detail and then ill come back to wrap up with an update on our reinvestment strategies and innovation initiatives before we take your questions matthew f hilzinger  usg corp thanks jenny and good morning everyone thats really great context for the first quarter its a quarter that requires perspective in both in terms of the period that were comparing our results to and perspective around balance of the year and ill touch on both of those in my comments today overall as jenny said we had a solid quarter that was unusually impacted by a strong uptick in commodity input cost and a pretty tough comp from a year ago other than the uptick in commodity costs our outlook for the year really hasnt changed we continue to see strength in all of our endmarkets so getting into the numbers lets briefly start with consolidated results for the first quarter net sales were up  to  million we generated  million in adjusted net income and  of adjusted diluted earnings per share and that compares to  million and  a year ago so let me get into the segments now starting with gypsum net sales for the first quarter were up  from last year to  million adjusted operating margin was down  basis points to  relative to our very strong first quarter performance a year ago our margin decline was primarily due to an unusual spike in commodity cost and lower volumes relative to last year so recall that the first quarter of  we saw wallboard volumes across the industry increase by  on prebuy dynamics which also drove favorability in unit costs so our us wallboard volumes were down just under  from the first quarter a year ago on this tough comp and this is pretty much in line with the rest of the industry which was down as a whole as jenny said its also very important to note that our yearoveryear volumes were not negatively impacted by our transition with lw as weve been able to replace those volumes at lw with volumes at new and current customers so moving to wallboard price our us wallboard price was up  yearonyear in the first quarter our price increase went into effect late january compared to last years price that went into the end of march just be aware that this creates a softer comp this quarter and a little bit more challenging comp next quarter regarding canada the final wallboard dumping rule for transfer pricing became effective during the first quarter the key takeaway is that we are required to charge higher prices for wallboard in western canada going forward and we saw some benefit from this in the first quarter now moving to costs costs for the first quarter were up significantly on a yearoveryear basis driving  million of unfavorability in our profit bridge before i break that first quarter number down for you let me just give you some fullyear perspective on our gypsum costs while our costs for the first quarter were up  million over an unusually lowcost quarter a year ago i expect that our fullyear  gypsum cost increased to be closer to just half of that or  or  for the remainder of the year so while commodity costs are always subject to variation i expect that first quarter to be the high watermark for gypsum costs so regarding the first quarter waste paper pricing in the occ market was the single biggest source of increased cost that we saw waste paper by itself drove a third of our total cost increase our occ costs were up over  compared to the prior year and most of that came in the months of february and march keep in mind that occ pricing tends to peak seasonally in the first quarter and i believe that the waste paper markets will ease from these levels throughout the year due in part to higher occ production in the spring as well as softer demand from china heading into the summer we also saw cost increase in our synthetic gypsum which amounted to another third of our total costs in the first quarter where there continues to be more than enough synthetic gypsum in the us to meet our production needs the transportation costs associated with synthetic gypsum have increased as we source from different utilities we do expect our synthetic gypsum costs to abate over the course of the year based on seasonal production levels at the power plants that serve us there were few other factors that drove up cost a bit too including product mix lower volumes as i had mentioned and some planned incremental costs for advanced manufacturing gas as expected was flat with last year and we expect gas to remain flat to last years cost through the balance of the year moving to surfaces and substrates product revenue grew  while profitability decreased  volume was up roughly  in our surfaces and substrates products which contributed roughly  million in profit this was offset by higher costs of  million due to increases in primarily three input costs cement costs paper costs and some labor for the rest of  i expect positive profit contribution each quarter on a yearonyear basis in this area and folks this is a great area for us it has delivered profitable growth over the past few years and its a focus area that i expect will continue to deliver real growth and profits into the future moving to ceilings we saw  basis point of margin contraction when compared to an alltime record first quarter a year ago the headline for you is that our volume run rate in the first quarter was lower than what we expect to see for the balance of the year and costs were higher than what were projecting for the balance of the year so us ceiling volumes decreased midsingle digits across tile and grid products from a year ago due primarily to some inventory rebalancing at a key customer based on our forecast commercial construction trends and lots of conversations with key customers we continue to expect that our fullyear ceilings volumes to be up in the lowsingle digits consistent with our original guidance in terms of manufacturing costs we saw yearonyear cost increase in both tile and grid although steel was the most pronounced we did see a bit of cost increase in tiles but that was driven primarily by maintenance around advanced manufacturing investments just remember last year steel price dropped dramatically and we recognized a benefit when it did steel prices have now moved back to a more normalized level and thats what were seeing in the first quarter more normalized steel costs against a strong prioryear tailwind so looking to the balance of the year steel costs will continue to be a headwind to the tune of maybe  million to  million per quarter lastly our ceilings pricing was flat in the first quarter due to customer mix as well as some tweaks that we made to customer incentive programs to drive growth in  moving to usg boral this segment had very strong first quarter this is a quarter that is typically the slowest in the year on a seasonal basis so really good performance out of boral the total jv earned  million in adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margins were up  basis points to  on strong performance from our plasterboard business plasterboard volumes across the entire jv were up  led by strong doubledigit growth in korea and midsingledigit growth in australia plasterboard price saw the greatest improvement in these markets as well and market conversion from our standard plasterboard to our sheetrock nextgen board increased sequentially by  basis points to  and our adjacent products continued to grow as well with steel studs up  and mineralfiber ceilings up  so ill finish with some brief comments on sga our share repurchase program and our debt refinancing plans starting with sga consolidated sga spending was up  million yearonyear in the first quarter and that was simply timing of expenses our original fullyear sga target of around  million for  has not changed regarding our share repurchase program which started in february we repurchased about  shares for roughly  million during the first quarter jenny and i as well as the board remain very committed to this program and ill keep you uptodate as we progress through the year as a reminder the total program is authorized for repurchases up to  million targeted over the next  to  months with respect to our debt plans i expect to refinance the   million bonds as well as our credit facility in the very near term and ill keep you posted on that as well so with that let me turn it back to jenny who can update you on our strategy jennifer f scanlon  usg corp thank you matt on our last call i outlined our  strategy which begins with maintaining a strong balance sheet continues with lowering our breakeven and balances investments for future growth were also committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and so today i want to talk about two elements of our strategy which address pressing challenges faced by our industry the first element is our previouslyannounced advanced manufacturing program that structurally improves our manufacturing cost with an eye toward our industrys anticipated skilled labor shortages in the future and the second element is an example of investments were making to strengthen our core wallboard business through innovation we are really excited about the launch of our nextgeneration of wallboard sheetrock brand ecosmart panels which aid in addressing sustainability challenges of water usage and co emissions challenges also faced by our industry so on to the first element our advanced manufacturing program which you can see on slide  accelerated this past quarter youll remember that advanced manufacturing initiatives are a strategic investment in our manufacturing operations and this investment aligns with our commitment to lower costs while providing safer environments and a more efficient workplace we are focused on adopting advanced technology and automation which can be replicated across our plants to eliminate lowvalue work and allow our employees to focus on making better products in a safer environment so simply put what is it were using automation lean six sigma training and performance metrics to streamline laborintensive manufacturing processes and were also establishing a datarich environment that will deploy advanced analytics to facilitate continuous improvement for many years to come advanced manufacturing represents a permanent step change in our cost structure that further lowers our breakeven by planning to invest up to  million in advanced manufacturing we expect to achieve an annual run rate savings of  million of ebitda which we expect will drop to the bottom line roughly  of this investment and return is expected in the gypsum business with  in the ceilings business and again were using lean six sigma methodology to assess the feasibility of projects that can be replicated across our plants performance metrics will enable us to track progress toward the financial goals for reporting advanced manufacturings contribution to operating margins ebitda and ebit and so lastly on slide  youll see our forecast for the trajectory of both investment spending and the return on these investments youll note that investment spending is relatively evenly spread out over the next three years and we can accelerate or decelerate those as we see fit based on the types of results and as well as market conditions in evaluating the timing of expected returns please understand were executing these initiatives on a repeatable basis so were piloting each project at one location establishing a blueprint and rolling out each bestinclass solution to the rest of our plant network where it makes sense to do so so this approach mitigates execution risk while maximizing benefits and you can see on slide  that assuming we spend  million which is planned for  we would expect to increase ebitda by about  million from this year to next year so on slide  youll see some examples of individual projects that we have under the advanced manufacturing umbrella and now for competitive reasons were not going to list everything were doing weve identified over  projects however these examples on these pictures should give you a tangible feel for the types of projects were undertaking so these examples include when installing continuous mining equipment to mine gypsum around the clock safely were mapping our quarries and auditing our stockpiles using an ipad an employee and a drone instead of assigning a team of people to make manual calculations were deploying selfguided forklifts that work safely and efficiently  loading our warehouses and staging loads for our customers and were implementing equipment that can handle cut and stack wallboard efficiently autonomously and safely so again when we talk about advanced manufacturing were not talking about revenue synergies or abstract crossselling opportunities to get to that  million in benefits this is about eliminating lowvalue work and allowing our employees to focus on making better products at a lower cost in safer environment and these projects are all under our roof and in our warehouse so we expect to update this information for you throughout the course of the program and matt and i are using this as a scorecard with our teams to assess progress and performance were very excited about how we believe advanced manufacturing will position usg for years to come now the second element of our strategy id like to discuss is strengthening our core wallboard business through innovation we were really excited in march to unveil our latest innovative product ecosmart panels the next generation of  and sheetrock brand wallboard its lighter its greener and is better performing than standard wallboard ecosmart panels are the industrys first wallboard panels that are both lightweight and sustainable these are features and benefits that are increasingly important for commercial construction the manufacturing process used to produce ecosmart panels reduces water usage by  and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by  ecosmart panels are  lighter than our standard  board and offer proven  productivity improvement for our customers and perhaps whats most exciting is that ecosmart panels are beginning to be specified by architects which is the first for wallboard its the first wallboard product to be specified based on how its made because of the meaningful difference in the environmental impact of the product so having an innovative wallboard product in our portfolio that is unique in how it addresses sustainability challenges also enables us to pull through other products to both new and existing customers this is a significant leap forward in wallboard technology that we believe is a game changer in the market and a real competitive advantage in north america and around the world as we move through the rest of the year i expect to continue to update you on the elements of our strategy including plans to fuel incremental growth by commercializing other nonwallboard platforms and products more rapidly so before we open it up for questions let me close by emphasizing we have a clear strategy and a bright outlook we are serving all of our customers very well we expect costs to increase in  but we have cost mitigation plans in place for some of this increase and we are expecting some abatement in raw material price increases throughout the year were deploying strategic capital to drive profitable growth with new and innovative products and were structurally reducing costs were also returning capital to shareholders i believe were in great shape and we will continue to evolve in our ability to drive shareholder value so with that operator at this time lets open the call for questions and remember as ryan said lets keep it to one per person thanks questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and our first question comes from kevin hocevar from northcoast research please go ahead kevin hocevar  northcoast research partners llc hey good morning everybody matt you gave some good detail on the raw material inflation that youre seeing in kind of your outlook i was wondering if you can give a little bit more detail in terms of some the key assumptions i think you said that paper price was up over  in the first quarter synthetic gypsum was up a bunch what are you seeing out of paper now what type of inflation are you seeing in the second quarter have you seen any abatement yet and whats kind of baked into that  to  what type of abatement do you expect out of synthetic and paper as we go through the year jennifer f scanlon  usg corp good morning kevin im going to let matt go into the details on that but i do want to emphasize one thing that hasnt change in our emphasis which is on margin expansion in every business and were making investments across the board advanced manufacturing ongoing pricing decisions commitment to lean six sigma but as youre getting into and as matt will give us the details there are going to be some quarters like this one where the timing of the commodity cost uptick and our investments for future growth detract from our ability to expand margin but we are in this for the long term and matts going to go into the details of what we expect for the rest of the year matthew f hilzinger  usg corp hey kevin so one thing is just put it in perspective usg has a great history of mitigating cost and being able to reduce cost and so ill speak a little bit about this quarter and a little bit about the balance of the year and give you a little bit of insight into what we see as kind of base level inflation in the business other than these commodity costs but with respect to occ it was up around  for the first quarter and specific to your question we have seen a little bit of relief in april and we expect more relief really to come into may for the balance of the year occ is probably going to be  to  above what it was last year so if you think about kind of numbers and how they roll through the pl on paper cost which is about  of our input for our wallboard just to give everybody a level set but as we think about cost that roll through it was probably  million out of the  million was paper cost and so we would think that thats going to abate to probably half as we go through the balance of the year so think of a headwind in occ of maybe  million to  million each quarter for the second through the fourth quarter and again its a commodity it might move up and down but we do see it and expect it to abate we see production moving up in the spring as i said the first quarter is typically the high watermark and demand in china is tailing off and so you cant be absolutely certain but were pretty confident at this point on everything that were saying that thats a reasonable way to think about occ on synthetic gypsum very similar story i think this is the high watermark if you think about the  million probably  million was synthetic gypsum and most of that was transportation cost and its partly because or mostly due to the power plants that we source from that are closest to our wallboard plants didnt run as much as they did in the prior year and so theres plenty of supply out there its just a matter of getting it to the plant so this isnt a supply issue this is really a transportation cost issue and again i would expect to mitigate about half of that as we go through the balance of the year that if you think about  million in the first quarter probably a headwind of  million per quarter going forward again its not a true commodity but it acts like a commodity and so things that can influence synthetic gypsum costs are things like weather natural gas prices i think it would be awesome if we had doubledigit demand in wallboard and that would probably drive synthetic gypsum costs up but we have great demand story so theres some things that can move it around but basically the way were seeing it right now is those commodity costs will be pretty much mitigated as we go through the balance of the year and then the other thing i would just say on the gypsum business is there is some remaining other costs that i talked about and there were like  million or  million of other costs part of that is mix product mix so we sold a little bit more  part of it was advanced manufacturing and about  million was labor so from my perspective when i sit there and think about the inherent underlying inflation in the gypsum business i mean like  million of increased labor and then we had some spikes in commodity costs so its not like the costs in the business are rampant and out of control were managing them very tightly and we got hit with some spikes in commodity costs so i feel pretty good about where we are and where were headed into the year and then one last comment because i dont want to hog everybodys time on the – for questions but just on ceilings cost right if you go back ceilings cost is primarily steel we had a little bit of an uptick in the tile cost that was due primarily to some work around advanced manufacturing and last year we had a nice tailwind on steel cost we called it out every quarter and steel cost had moved a little bit back above what they were at the beginning of the year a year ago but to a more normalized level and thats effectively whats happening so the headwind is really kind of reversal of the tailwind and the benefit that we got last year so again when you think about costs and our production cost and how we operate its really very very low inherent underlying inflation in the business we just got hit with some commodity costs so hope that answers your question and well move on to the next person operator our next question comes from scott rednor from zelman  associates please go ahead scott rednor  zelman  associates yeah hi good morning matt i was hoping you could explain the noise with canada obviously last quarter there was a big tailwind this quarter even with the higher prices profit was down it doesnt look like there was some noise on your us operations so could you maybe just kind of clarify how we should think about that with the final tariffs in place matthew f hilzinger  usg corp yeah i think scott the way i would think about it is i think last quarter we tried to parse out some stuff because it was still very much influx with the canadian authorities and it was kind of unclear as to what was going to happen and so obviously they ruled – the canadian authorities ruled in the first quarter and effectively i will tell you if you go take a look at the documents they are incredibly complicated so again my headline is is that we are required to charge higher prices in western canada for imports weve done that i think our strategy is quite frankly to try and increase some production in eastern canada and have it flow over into western canada obviously we want to serve our customers in the best way we can and then there will be and continue to be some exports into western canada i dont want to try and parse into how much – what the benefit was in canada because id tell you what it just – it starts to get really muddy and the numbers start to just look a little goofy when you start going through it so just suffice it to say that this is something that we think is relatively permanent meaning that they ruled for at least five years so the idea that wallboard pricing in canada is going to – its still market pricing but you have to charge a higher price but to think that thats going to reverse or go back in a different direction over the next five years is very unlikely and so we really do kind of view this as a permanent step change in how were going to manufacture and deliver products to our customers in canada scott since i have you on the phone and i hate to dominate this but i think i read a writeup today and there was a question around our tax rate i just want to clear that up were still guiding on  to  our original guidance on taxes there was an accounting rule change that required some marktomarket on incentive comp that normally blew through equity needs to blow through the effective tax line and so we had expected that so the higher tax rate in the first quarter was not a surprise to us at all and again the original guidance that we gave of  to  sticks and quite frankly thats a marktomarket it could go up it could go down and so youll see a little bit more volatility in the etr line but no sweat dont think that thats a big headwind for us its not with that ill turn it back to the operator operator our next question comes from stephen kim from evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim  evercore isi yeah thanks very much guys appreciate all the color on input cost inflation i would just observe that your guidance would seem to suggest that you are – i think it may be a little ambiguous in your slide that your guidance is i assume on the drywall alone not the gypsum segment when you talk about  to  correct me if im wrong and that the  million in cost that you talk about in services and substrate is included in the  million that youre talking about for cost just want to make sure thats clear because otherwise im having trouble reconciling the numbers matthew f hilzinger  usg corp no stephen kim  evercore isi my matthew f hilzinger  usg corp go ahead stephen im sorry to interrupt stephen kim  evercore isi no no no just correct me if theres anything wrong in that and then i just wanted to ask if you were still seeing the dynamic that you had addressed back in march about how occ pricing is only about  i believe you said of your costs and that it was less significant for you given your geographic location – your geographic concentration away from the coasts matthew f hilzinger  usg corp yeah let me address that one i think thats correct and i think thats relative to other people out there too and obviously we dont know what other folks are doing on syn gyp we think some have probably stockpiled some are probably going to have to bear some costs some are on more natural rock sources so cant really necessarily speak to what our competitors are going to deal with in terms of costs but ive given you i think pretty clear guidance in terms of what we think were doing on syn gyp and look on the cost guidance piece that  million is us wallboard right so surfaces and substrates is different so youll see in the walk there is a  million hit right thats  million of profit and  million of cost so if you added all of it together itd be  million right  million on us wallboard and  million on surfaces and substrates so i think thats how i would think about it when i talked about abating it was really the us wallboard side on surfaces and substrates look our view right now is that business is going to be profitable each quarter going forward its probably going to have a little bit of cost inflation just because paper does go into some of that product weve got some cement that goes into some of that product as well and weve seen a little price increase on that as well but we would expect surfaces and substrates to turn net positive like it has for the last three years so i hope thats helpful stephen operator and our next question comes from michael rehaut from jpmorgan please go ahead michael jason rehaut  jpmorgan securities llc thanks very much good morning my question has to do i guess going back with gypsum margins and apologies if im asking a question might be a little duplicative with some of the comments you made earlier its been a crazy morning i had to jump off briefly but just trying to get a sense when you think about the us gypsum margin and the yearoveryear decline and obviously youve kind of gone into great detail around the costs but as you look out for the rest of the year would you expect the margin decline to continue for at least the next couple of quarters everything else equal and when i say everything else im specifically thinking about gypsum pricing or would there be an ability – would you be considering any type of additional price adjustments and i know you dont talk about price on a goforward basis but just conceptually if you are experiencing higher inflation than expected i presume that price would be one of the tools that would be used to offset that so kind of a twopart question one everything else equal no changes to price or anything else would you expect the margin decline to continue this year and two is there an ability to make adjustments to the price in the marketplace if needed jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah mike thanks for the question and i think i want to reiterate that our emphasis on margin expansion in every business our expectations around that for our team hasnt changed we do believe as matt has indicated that some of these commodity upticks are going to be abated but we also know that weve given some guidance on expectations around costs our pricing decisions have not changed with regard to – we dont comment on forward pricing but i do want to remind everybody what the nottoexceed pricing model means and what that means is we give our customers their pricing for a duration of time we announce  days in advance any changes and thats in any nottoexceed model there are opportunities to have continued conversations with customers about what were seeing in the marketplace operator our next question comes from bob wetenhall from rbc capital markets please go ahead marshall mentz  rbc capital markets llc good morning this is actually marshall mentz on for bob in ceilings could you talk a bit more about the inventory rebalancing it sounds transitory and youre maintaining your volume guidance but could you give any more details there and do the rebate programs that you call out factor into that and how should we think about the price environment given those comments jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah thanks what were seeing and what were hearing in the marketplace in conversations with many of our customers is that there is a sense that the amount of inventory in the channel may have declined a bit but that a number of our customers in many regions have reported a continued singledigit – lowsingledigit volume increases out their doors and so were really looking at some of the change in ceiling volumes truly from a perspective of that context we do think with regard to both the rebate programs that we enacted which are reflective of our growth expectations for the year but our accrual for those growth expectations may have revealed some of that flatness in this quarter on price and so we feel good about the direction of the ceilings business that weve been giving its a good lowsingledigit volume increase we expect to see product mix continue to reflect the trends of higherend premium products and we dont feel that anything else has changed in the ceilings business our distribution channel hasnt changed our contractor loyalty hasnt changed and demand for infill for repair and remodel hasnt changed so we feel like its a pretty stable commercial environment for us operator our next question comes from john lovallo from bank of america please go ahead john lovallo  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys thank you for taking my call as well my question is on the  pricing that you guys saw i guess if you can help parse it out maybe to what component of that was kind of true likeforlike pricing what was maybe attributable to product mix like ecosmart and then maybe if canada played any part of that thanks jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah im happy to report that weve seen a price increase across every channel which resulted in  yearonyear and we also saw a volume movement in line with the industry which i think is reflective of what we believe is this underlying organic growth and the success of the lw transition i will say that even without lw our top  customers without lw increased volumes and so when you look at this price increase again we saw it across every channel we havent changed anything in our formulas around our price and volume equation we balance that weve got some regions where weve seen some real strength weve got some regions where theres some real favorable trends and we think all of this is reflective of our value proposition ecosmart which is priced as a premium product was launched really in midmarch so it didnt have any meaningful impact on the price increase that we saw in the channel this quarter operator thank you our next question comes from michael wood from nomura instinet please go ahead michael wood  nomura instinet hi good morning in light of the steppedup input costs that you talked about are you planning more productivity initiatives and could you just comment on – i think you said  million advanced manufacturing spend i believe it was  million that you called out last quarter in capex related to that so just some color there would be appreciated matthew f hilzinger  usg corp hey mike its matt so it fluctuates – i would say  million to  million for advanced manufacturing and look part of that ebbs and flows right i mean we havent told the engineering team to go spend  million i mean its a guidance right its in that area and to the extent that they can find projects and accelerate those and move them in well do that right i mean were going to try and move this thing along as quickly as we can so part of that is just think about that as a guidance range its not – nothing has changed and its – really were going to try and get as much as we possibly can and look in terms of productivity i just – i want to be clear i mean this is not panic mode for us right i mean input costs moved up a little bit we think theyre going to abate as i said the base inflation in the business we think is relatively small weve had programs in place here at the company around lean six sigma and productivity that continue on and they will continue on and so we arent going to do anything here silly or stupid and cut a bunch of costs that are going to hurt our ability to grow or take away from our ability to get in advanced manufacturing and so weve got a great history of being able to mitigate costs and thats what were doing and i think if you really look at the base inflation of the business weve really been good at doing that and so its really these commodity costs that have moved up and well abate them as best we can but thats partly why were putting in advanced manufacturing right is to get  million benefit at the cost line so i think were doing all the things that we need to do and look were always going to – look trust me jenny and i have had lots of conversations with our supply and our operating group about what we can do to mitigate costs and theyre working on it and i can say this to our shareholders were going to give every ounce of effort we can to keep the cost low and i think weve done that and i think well continue to do that michael wood  nomura instinet thank you operator our next question comes from jerry revich from goldman sachs please go ahead unknown speaker hi this is abdul  on behalf of jerry i just had a question about ceilings so price versus cost was negative in the quarter can you just talk a bit about why the price increases that were announced didnt stick thank you jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah i think when you look across our channel in ceilings therere some noise this quarter that – around customer mix and some of the pricing flatness and what we believe is a lowering of inventory across the channel and so its really important to note that ceilings is a  to month sales cycle and as were out there fitting jobs and quoting projects with our customers the pricing evolves over time and so indeed we did see some flatness this quarter on pricing but some of that is also reflective of the expanded rebates programs that we put out there for some key customers in our channels and the way in which that were accruing for the expectations of the projects that theyre going to win this year matthew f hilzinger  usg corp and let me just add a little bit of color and detail to what jenny said on the customer mix piece just think that the gsd  which typically sells the highervalue highermargin product went down because of inventory balancing and we sold a little bit more in the big box which tends towards the more commodity oriented so that product mix can change pretty dramatically what you see on the price line so thats how i would think about the customer mix piece operator our next question comes from garik shmois from longbow securities please go ahead garik s shmois  longbow research llc hi thanks just had a followup on ceilings demand i just wonder if you could helps us maybe bridge the down midsingledigit volume in the quarter to the lowsingledigit volume outlook for the full year in the context of the inventory destocking that you saw on q should we expect to snap back at some point whether q q on inventories or is your expectation that the volume growth from this point forward will be a more gradual climb towards your fullyear guidance matthew f hilzinger  usg corp hey garik its matt i would put it in terms of – look i dont know how long the balancing effort takes right rebalancing inventory typically takes more than one quarter right so we just – again these are – our customers theyre doing what they need to do for their business hard to know exactly what theyre going to do in terms of the timing of their rebalancing but given what we did and given the low or the midsingledigit decline that we saw in the first quarter youd have to have probably  to  growth in second third and fourth quarter in order to kind of stay in that lowsingle digit for a total years growth of kind of lowsingle digit so will there be a snap back look i think jenny said it earlier on were hearing that its reasonably good demand at the endmarket level we just arent seeing it because of our customers certain customers rebalancing their inventory so we feel pretty good about where that is now when that snaps back i dont know largely depends upon how our customers continue in in their rebalancing program so – but we feel – i think the main headline here is that were still seeing kind of that lowsingledigit growth in ceilings out in the marketplace with our endcustomers operator our next question comes from mike dahl from barclays please go ahead michael dahl  barclays capital inc hi thanks for taking my question just a followup on the rebate comments just hoping just to clarify is this something that was kind of a proactive outreach to your customers just given the ongoing lw transition or is it also somewhat reflective of just the ongoing consolidation among your larger distributors jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah i think the thing to bear in mind mike is that our distribution channel nothing about ceilings distribution changed with the transition of lw from being part of usg to being independent we havent changed anything within that channel and so really the rebates are in anticipation of the market thats out there and the need for our distributors to continue to be as strong as they can be supporting those contractors who are loyal to usg products and getting out there and winning jobs in this  to month cycle so i wouldnt characterize it as anything other than a typical type of price volume equation that we do every year in all of our product lines matthew f hilzinger  usg corp yeah and i would add onto this mike id add just a little bit of color to what jenny said and that is we have asked some of our customers to be a little bit more aggressive on the sales line in terms of sales growth right not necessarily market share we want to grow the market and weve given them some incentives to go do that and so it is a little different than the prior year from the standpoint that were trying to incent growth with our customers operator our next question comes from phil ng from jefferies please go ahead philip ng  jefferies llc hey guys i cover some of the paper names but i dont think any of these companies are expecting the magnitude of decline you called out for occ just curious to what gives you that type of confidence i know that its a very regional business and can you flesh out some of the pace of the cost savings that youre expecting to kick in over the course of the year is it a little more frontend loaded backend loaded i think you guys got the sga largely unchanged thanks matthew f hilzinger  usg corp yeah hi phil its matt look if you think about base inflation as i talked about like in labor in the us gypsum business it was like  million right i mean i think were going to kind of continue to see that and were going to eat away at that a little bit the commodity costs are the ones that i described right and theyre going to move as they move and we think theyre going to abate through the balance of the year so i think i gave some good guidance in terms of how to think about those commodity costs through the balance of the year like every year weve had and every quarter weve had before this were going to continue to go through and work on productivity so its really – i mean if you boil it down its primarily commodity costs that drove the first quarter variance against a last year that was incredibly beneficial on the cost line and so i dont think theres – theres not like a hockey stick or theres not – i mean its just you got to think about how those commodity costs are going to roll through by quarter in order to kind of do your model but its not like weve got this huge benefit coming in in the fourth quarter i mean it largely depends upon how commodity costs go through and weve given you a view on that so operator our next question comes from trey grooms from stephens please go ahead trey h grooms  stephens inc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i guess everything has pretty well been vetted that i had but just one kind of housekeeping i guess matt can you remind us how much of your footprint on the sheetrock side utilizes synthetic gypsum and then also you noted freight as a kind of a headwind there on the syn gyp side i guess getting the material from the utilities to the plant how much of the increase that youve seen on synthetic gypsum is more of the freight versus more seasonal production cycles within the utility and how do we think about that and i would think that you would have some longterm agreements with some of these utilities on pricing just if you can help us understand the mechanics and how thats moving around as well as the exposure there matthew f hilzinger  usg corp yeah sure trey so look about  of our rock source is synthetic gypsum and its primarily a more east coast than it is west coast and its predominantly freight is the penalty we do have longerterm contracts but – so most of its freight and part of the reason that we think it will abate a little bit i talked a little bit about were moving into the summer season when coal will – you just need more coal to go but you can rail more in the summer months than you can in the winter months and so there are some things around the freight cost that we think will cause us to have lower freight cost as well but its predominantly freight its not the base cost of synthetic gypsum so i hope thats helpful operator our next question comes from keith hughes from suntrust please go ahead keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you just switching back to gypsum for a minute as you go through the rest of the year i know that lw is involved in the transition and you talked about how well its gone do you have a feel from them yet in terms of how quickly the transition go will it go in the offseason any sort of clarity you can give on that will be helpful jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah thanks keith the lw transition is something that we planned with the supply agreement wrapped around it to be orderly and something that really was not going to change overall market dynamics and we feel good about that i think we do have to go back and realize a comment i made in i believe the last call that channel conflict was real and having lw as a independent specialty dealer is beneficial for us as a manufacturer because it allows us to position our value proposition that really appeals to contractors it allows us to position that and have contractors pull that through all players in the channel without feeling that theres conflict and so as i said earlier what were seeing is that without lw our top five customers increased volume we saw that last quarter we see it this quarter and our overall growth we feel is yearonyear shipments are in line with industry so i think overall this transition like i said is exceeding my expectations and its orderly and its going at the exact pace that we expected it to go ryan flanagan  usg corp we have time for one other question operator our next question comes from scott schrier from citi please go ahead scott schrier  citigroup global markets inc hi thanks for squeezing me in there i wanted to ask you about your new product on the ecosmart which – i think its great that youre helping the environment i just want to parse out maybe how do you think about it from a penetration from production cost and a margin perspective since its light i would expect a lower shipping cost maybe whether you have some tailwinds on your rd expenses and are there any other kind of marketing expenses near term with the rollout and then lastly if you could talk about is this technology something you can move into other products such as your sheathing thank you jennifer f scanlon  usg corp yeah thanks scott i love talking about ecosmart so im glad you got your question in weve addressed this first launch on the commercial industry and it really is out there to give architects the solution to help them meet commitments that they have made theres this architecture  challenge out there which is all about coming up with buildings that have zero carbon footprint and they take that all the way back into the manufacturing process and so what were seeing in this product and why its valuable and we always look when we have any product  to find ways to expand that across our portfolio and were doing some pilots on ways to expand it across our portfolio but whats important is that it really does fundamentally change the way in which we manufacture a wallboard and so it reduces water usage in the manufacturing process by about  which reduces the amount of co emissions consumed by the drying process and because its lighter it reduces transportation so its really a trifecta of benefits from the way in which weve redesigned this product in this manufacturing process ultralight was very beneficial to contractors because its lighter ecosmart is beneficial to architects and contractors because its sustainable and its lighter and well continue to find ways to spread the investments and the benefits that we get from our research and development our customer innovation center across all of our product portfolio in ways that we think expands our value proposition so lots of reasons to be excited about this product and im glad you asked jennifer f scanlon  usg corp all right so with that i want to thank everybody for your interest in usg this morning and i really want to thank our  usg employees for the continued efforts that every single one of you is making out there and your dedication to ensuring that we are the leading manufacturer of building products and innovative solutions around the world i look forward to next quarter and thank you for your time today ryan flanagan  usg corp thanks jenny a taped replay of this call will be available until

incredible amount of technology and innovative thinking goes into our products we need talented employees that are skilled in science technology engineering and math to connect with our diverse employee and customer bases we focus on research and development at our innovation center and in fact are awarded dozens of patents each year so there is always something fresh and new we are bringing to the market what makes it exciting to work at usg is that as we travel around the country or around the world we can see that our products are part of creating important buildings for example we provided the first shaft wall system used in some of the tallest buildings in the us such as the willis tower in chicago and one world trade center in new york city we shipped usg products from the us to dubai to build the burj khalifa we have been a leader in providing innovative solutions and systems required to create buildings of that scale people really identify with that sense of creating something i think this excitement stems from the fact that our industry contributes to creating the places where people live and work every day we’re part of it all and that’s fun usg prides itself on building a worldclass workforce and we make it a priority to have a diverse and inclusive workplace how important is brand and brand awareness to usg usg is one of the leading brands in the building industry we also have some of the most recognizable product brands in our industry we’ve found that the sheetrock® product brand really resonates with consumers people know it and it’s an iconic product when we launched our usg products into asia australia and the middle east markets we found that the sheetrock® product brand resonated in other countries as well additionally our joint compound “with the green lid” is wellknown within our industry we’re proud that our products are the stamp of excellence for commercial contractors how important is diversity and the efforts around making sure you have that type of environment diversity is essential in making sure that we’re including different perspectives with all of the intellect and talent that is out there the construction industry has evolved a lot since our company was founded it’s important that our employees are reflective of our customer base so we can better understand and meet their needs we recently received an award by a prominent chicago organization chicago united for our focus on diversity and inclusion we’re proud usg has been recognized for our efforts diversity really is about including people of all ethnicities genders talents and experiences when we look at the issues that our customers care about – labor shortages water scarcity or time management – we think about the science engineering and technology that is needed to solve them and we need to make sure we have people that can solve these problems for example we have a food scientist in our research center that is focused on developing different compositions for the chemistry of our products we also have another talented scientist who came from the cosmetics industry and some of the work she has done has been extremely helpful in allowing us to think differently about our manufacturing processes if we weren’t willing to consider a diverse pool of candidates and only hired from within our industry we would not have had some of our most innovative product breakthroughs will you talk about your views around the responsibility that leading companies have to address broader community needs we are truly committed to being good corporate citizens in the communities where we live and work we always think about how we can better serve our customers be better corporate citizens and be the best employer for our people corporate engagement in our communities is an essential piece of that supporting the communities we serve is an important part of life at usg we have a number of means for employees to get involved and our usg foundation sets the tone usg also matches contributions that our employees make in time or money to local nonprofits the foundation focuses on housing health and human services and education and our employees are very engaged and committed to giving back to the local neighborhoods in which they live is there such a thing as finding a balance between the shortterm pressures and making longterm investments for the company we are now in a strong financial position which provides opportunities to invest in our future it is really important to have a strong and healthy balance sheet to enable us to make wise decisions about investing in our business this past year we paid off more than  billion in debt and we’re back to having a balance sheet that is at the right leverage ratio for our company this has reduced our interest expense and provides us the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities we’ll continue to evaluate growth opportunities in a disciplined fashion and consider the ways to return capital to shareholders we are also looking to see how we can round out our portfolio in our core manufacturing business is the dialogue that is taking place around advancement for women the right one usg prides itself on building a worldclass workforce and we make it a priority to have a diverse and inclusive workplace i’m honored to be the first female ceo in usg’s history i believe there are great opportunities for women at usg and in our industry our company has been very involved in programs that encourage more women to pursue or advance their careers in manufacturing and all areas of our business and i am happy to continue our commitments to stem science technology engineering and mathematics programs there is a continued focus on recruiting and retaining women for positions within the stem fields i’m very encouraged by the progress out there but everybody needs to be really clear that the way those opportunities unfold is to be the best candidate that is available it’s about rolling up one’s sleeves and focusing on those essential skills in an industry – the science and engineering topics and the math and technology are what open the doors for anyone i have seen a lot of progress in diversity in our industry we recently sold usg’s distribution business lw supply to abc supply owned by one of the most successful selfmade entrepreneurs in the country diane hendricks she’s leading a terrific company also what goes in the wall right behind our sheetrock® brand wallboard is insulation and we have mary rhinehart leading johns manville who has been a great role model in the industry being in chicago i get to see some of the iconic structures that jeanne gang of studio gang is building and see that she has been recognized for her work it’s great to follow the many great female architects around the world who are becoming more prominent and earning recognition for what they do i’m always fascinated when i travel in asia and mexico – our customers are frequently familyowned businesses so the whole family is involved the husband might be the head of sales and the wife might be the head of marketing or accounting but they’re in it together we’re seeing many women take over the leadership helm of these family businesses over time i find that to be really exciting because they are role models in their local communities do you feel you’ve been able to have a number of different careers within one company absolutely i initially came to usg for a better worklife balance but i also joined because i knew there would be great opportunities here at that time i didn’t even know how many opportunities i would actually have but that has always been my numberone focus at usg i wanted to keep learning and keep myself fresh i made sure that i was contributing in some way shape or form that is meaningful to the company i have always been involved at usg and it’s been terrific when young people ask me what advice i have for them i tell them that at any point in their careers they have to balance the work opportunities that are presented to them with their family and personal obligations and their compensation at any step they have to feel they have the right balance although it might never be perfect are you able to enjoy the process and celebrate some of the wins while sometimes i’m big on “even better next time” i think it’s important to step back and reflect on our achievements i have found that employees feel the same way – they want to feel good about the things that have been accomplished and it is fun to celebrate successes it’s something that i have become better at throughout my career• click here to download a pdf of an interview with jennifer f scanlon president and chief executive officer usg

key to global competitiveness women are underrepresented in manufacturing but companies such as usg corp see more women in the industry as a key to increased competitiveness jennifer f scanlon svp usg corp  jul   the recent passing of father ted hesburgh former president of my alma mater university of notre dame got me thinking about his trailblazing wisdom on inclusion as a vehicle for driving progress and competitiveness father ted was visionary in admitting women to notre dame in the s based on his belief that the university could never be great if  of the world’s thinkers were excluded and today notre dame is one of the most prestigious institutions in the country with almost twice the percentage of female engineers of any university in the country it is simple yet genius get a diverse cross section of the population together and you will achieve greater innovation and overall success according to a recent article by sheryl sandberg and adam grant “if men want to make their work teams successful one of the best steps they can take is to bring on more women” but in manufacturing women are underrepresented “women represent manufacturing’s largest pool of untapped talent” says the manufacturing institute study untapped resource how manufacturers can attract retain and advance talented women while women make up approximately  of the labor force the number of women in the manufacturing labor force is only  according to the manufacturing institute that’s why in recent years the manufacturing institute has worked to address this deficit by launching programs like the science technology engineering and production step ahead program the program highlights the role of women in the manufacturing industry through recognition research and leadership it also offers best practices for how manufacturers can attract support retain and advance women at usg we are actively recruiting and promoting women to take on manufacturing roles as well as positions in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics stem we know that these jobs are incubators for innovation which help us stay competitive and promote future growth in our business but for usg it goes beyond recruitment we also work hard to mentor our employees reward them and encourage them to grow in their careers ann franzen is usg’s first female plant manager and the managing sponsor for usg’s “women in manufacturing” wim our employee resource group developed to support female employees ann first joined usg in  “i’ve had some great bosses who have encouraged me to push myself and take on new opportunities” she says “but it was challenging to be the only woman in my role and not have female peers to turn to for guidance that’s part of why i’m so passionate about our wim group” through recruitment efforts mentoring opportunities training and peer networking wim works to support female employees and develop them to become future leaders for example the group provides each new female engineer with a welcome packet and assigns them a mentor like year usg veteran marsha skinner marsha was a driving force in the creation of our popular fiberock® product and today leads the operation that last year produced a record amount of product at the lowest manufacturing cost since startup more than  years ago “it has been a challenging experience and one in which the team has had to overcome many obstacles” marsha said “but i have enjoyed working with a diverse group of employees to solve problems and deliver a oneofakind operation for the company” we also employ a number of women who are successful sales and marketing leaders around the world – in places like uruguay mexico singapore korea and lebanon along with the us and canada this is important because many of our customers in asia and south america are familyrun businesses with wives and daughters in charge of sales marketing and finance ultimately when we bring different people together we have better engagement and innovation which helps us stay competitive in today’s global economy this helps us meet and exceed our customers’ expectations and our business objectives and it’s the right thing to do father ted understood decades ago that women make up half of the potential human capital available in any economy and the efficient use of this talent pool is a key driver for continued competitiveness we should all follow his lead and i’m proud to say that at usg we are jennifer f scanlon is senior vice president and president international of usg corp a manufacturer of construction
