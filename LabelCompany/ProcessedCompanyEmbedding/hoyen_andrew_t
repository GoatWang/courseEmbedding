research v   p    pages posted  sep    andrew t norman drake university date written  abstract the literature on brand alliances establishes the significance of the “fit” concept specifically it has been shown that consumers evaluate the extent to which the brands and products in a brand alliance are congruent various articles have studied the effects of brand and product fit on attitude toward the brand alliance suggesting that stronger degrees of fit result in the most favorable outcomes however there is a lack of research on the effects of brand and product fit on memory retention this research is based on concepts in cognitive psychology leading to hypotheses that suggest that stronger fit is not always better a  x  experiment provides support for those hypotheses keywords brand
