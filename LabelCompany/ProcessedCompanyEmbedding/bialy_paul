of an english muffin and a bagel this flat round baked product is low in calories fat and cholesterol with no sugar or oil added the texture of the top and the bottom of a bialy are distinctively different the top is light and crunchy while the bottom is heavier and chewy   the creation of a quality bialy takes great skill and consistency following over  years of tradition the bell bialy is still “pulled” by hand with the middle indented by thumb and freshly grated onion mixture spooned into the indentation before the bialy is placed into the oven   just slice and eat there are many different ways to eat a bialy traditionally the bialy was eaten warm fresh from the bakery butter was spread on top so it would pool in the hole or it was smeared on the bottom nowadays the bialy is sliced in half than toasted there is still a difference of opinion about whether the top and bottom should be eaten separately or together let the consumer decide a range of toppings work well with a bialy—butter cream cheese jam smoked fish or a favorite sandwich filling   weight   oz types bialy bialy stick bialy roll pletzel     bagels by bell now sells direct   find out more » leave a reply

subscribe follow us topics  economy baking history the bialy april   at  am edt sorry the video for this story has expired but you can still read the transcript below  email paul solman new york city’s lower east side– for decades home to countless immigrants from eastern europe and one delicacy from there that’s been the object lately of food writer mimi sheraton’s obsession mimi sheraton author “the bialy eaters” that spice… paul solman reporter hot mimi sheraton right paul solman sheraton loves a good bialy– an onionflecked roll that’s distantly related to the bagel– and believes the bialys made here at kossar’s bakery are the best in the city the country– quite possibly the world she speaks with some authority having spent seven years researching her new book “the bialy eaters” mimi sheraton i almost never eat bagels because bagels have become so large and so doughy and so soft they’ve lost their character a bialy to me is much more satisfying– the crunch the aroma and so on paul solman now a bialy for those who may never have had one tastes a lot like pizza crust– no surprise since bialy dough is made from the identical recipe of flour water salt and yeast mimi sheraton the exact origin of the bialy is not known but this is my theory… paul solman sheraton believes the bialy was born of an accident in a polish bakery sometime in the th century mimi sheraton one day someone dropped it on the floor someone else not seeing it came over and stepped on it the baker not wanting to waste it picked up smeared on poppy seed and onion baked it tasted it and declared a eureka moment in bread history paul solman you actually believe that mimi sheraton i actually believe it it’s as good as anything else and i think it will become seminal i expect to see it in “la rousse gastronomie’s” next edition paul solman since then of course bialys have been made under somewhat more hygienic conditions baker you shape it with your thumb that’s how i… and you just hold your… you’re getting there you don’t have to pull it out too wide i can see a second career you know paul solman a second career oh okay now then you’ve got to put… baker that’s called a shmear we call it shmearing when we place the onions in– shmear paul solman shmear– like to smear baker right right paul solman of course there’s no way i could keep up with fred rosner who shmears  bialys an hour and even that’s slow compared to a machine but coowner debbie engelmayer refuses to automate deborah engelmayer coowner kossar’s bakery we bought a family business with history and to automate… there are other bialy places that automate and they make fine bialys but they’re… they’re not kossar’s bialys paul solman not many people in this world grew up on bialys and though at kossar’s there are scandinavians asians west indians who buy them most americans don’t including one local who did grow up on bialys paul solman now what does bialy mean to you man heartburn paul solman heartburn  laughter  so what inspired an entire book on bialys well when mimi sheraton began her research she was simply interested in foods named after places mimi sheraton what is danish pastry like in denmark do the french eat something called french toast i always loved bialys and when i was going to poland in  to do a story on restaurants i thought of going to bialystok just to see where they came from paul solman bialystok poland– it’s what gives the bialy story a larger significance nowadays bialystok is an all polish city of about  near the eastern border with belarus– white russia but up until world war ii about half the population were jews who owned many of the downtown shops much of the booming textile trade mimi sheraton it was a very active prosperous town known as the city with the golden heart it had hospitals for the indigent it had homes for the aged it had summer camps for poor children paul solman it also had bialy bakeries– one on nearly every street person on newsreel speaking through interpreter in bialystok you must taste the local delicacies paul solman the locals called the bread bialystok kuchen… mimi sheraton from a little cake or a little bread paul solman …which gave the jews of bialystok their nickname bialystok kuchen fressers mimi sheraton …a fresser who is a prodigious eater so it’s a prodigious eater of these little bialystok rolls paul solman in fact bialys were so entwined with prewar jewish identity they earned their very own joke in leo rosten’s jewish american classic “the joys of yiddish” mimi sheraton a woman goes to a bialy baker and he tells her the price of the bialys and she says “ cents a dozen for bialys the baker across the street is charging only 0 cents” and the baker says “so buy them across the street” she says “well today he happens to be out of them” he says “oh well when i’m out of bialys i charge only 0 cents a dozen too” paul solman mix jews and bialys and the jokes fly with the flour you’ve already met leon schreiber neighborhood buddy of fred the baker leon schreiber and during the holidays… my name is leon i spell it backwards– it’s noel– i get more presents paul solman schreiber graduated from the famed high school across the street from kossar’s seward park a veritable breeding ground for jewish entertainers who else went to seward park leon schreiber at the time i did paul solman yeah yeah leon schreiber tony curtis that i know paul solman tony curtis was in your class leon schreiber no no he was six months behind me paul solman six months behind you leon schreiber and three years ahead of me was walter matthau paul solman and zero mostel also went to this school leon schreiber paul it was way before my time i remember him paul solman zero mostel bound forever to the bialy’s birthplace through his portrayal of max bialystok a broadway producer so inept when he tried to put on an outrageous flop to rip off investors the show was a hit scene from “the producers” springtime for hitler and germany  bullets ricocheting  machinegun fire  two steps are new steps today paul solman mel brooks’ “the producers” was overthetop satire laughing to keep from crying — because what happened to the bialystok kuchen fressers explains why the humble roll they fressed may well be worth remembering on june   the nazis marched into bialystok and burned down the central synagogue as many as  jews were trapped inside over the next two years thousands more died in mass killings in august  the  jews who remained were shipped to auschwitz treblinka and maidanek or to save on transportation costs shot in bialystok itself half a century later mimi sheraton found five jews living in bialystok not a single bialy bakery only dim recollections of the onceubiquitous onion roll she returned to new york’s lower east side the center of a tightknit but farflung community mimi sheraton this is the bialystok center and home for the aged when i wrote an article for their publication i heard from bialystokers all over the world and as they talked about the bialys they talked about their mothers and their fathers and their siblings and school and then i would say “and then what happened” and what happened to about half of them was the holocaust some had been in concentration camps some escaped some did as many did in… around bialystok was run across the border to russia and join the soviet army paul solman albert sabin of polio vaccine fame former israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir they were among those who escaped early leo melamed the man credited with creating the options market had childhood memories of being lifted up to watch bialys coming out of the oven and samuel pisar famed international lawyer diplomat and author of the  bestseller “of blood and hope” gave sheraton this account samuel pisar “when i was an adolescent in auschwitz lying on the hard shelf that was my bed and hallucinating from hunger i would often try to recall the shape and savory aroma of the kuchen we used to eat at home in bialystok by that time i had lost all of my family and school friends years later when i was in new york i marveled at the whites blacks asians and latinos as they munched on their bialys i felt as though i was from another planet paul solman is there something that the people you interviewed for this book who came from bialystok and survived the second world war have in common mimi sheraton yes it was a sense of loss the lost bread the lost words the lost family paul solman for me as it happens bialys were a muchloved breadstuff of my youth paul solman which ones are mine baker these are yours look at them paul solman hey baker these are shaina– beautiful pretty paul solman shaina a shaina bialy paul solman but to be honest i’d thought even less about the bialy’s roots than mimi sheraton had when she began her search eight years ago mimi sheraton wow that’s very good for a first try mimi sheraton in doing this book the bialy did for me in a sense what the madeleine did for proust or at least did for the people i interviewed it recalled a whole world and an entire way of life paul solman it’s a society that like marcel proust’s has vanished but in a sense it lives on in the humble bialy share on facebook share on twitter share via text religion are you aware of our comment policy pbs newshour allows open

i worked for a small cafe outside of augusta we sold a mediocre crop of maine bagels i specify maine bagels because they weren’t entirely authentic  ie they weren’t boiled before baking the bagels were okay… but only okay well except for this peculiar onion and poppy seed bagel that we almost always sold out of one day a couple from new york came into the cafe tried one of our “onion bagels” and declared “this is really more of a bialy than a bagel but it’s delicious” “what the heck is a bialy…” i smiled nodded and feigned knowledge that i did not actually have i’m from maine my family is a typical almost cliché combination of french and irish i had no idea what a bialy was but i immediately charged into a google search after the couple had left if you’re also from maine and unfamiliar with bialys you are not alone but you are missing out bialys are pure gold they are perfect they are my favorite thing ever i want to name my future child bialy just kidding my kid is going to be named mordecai… or jay z i haven’t decided yet anyway the yiddish word bialy is actually a shortened form of the original name bialystoker kuchen according to the not always reliable but close enough google translate this means “bialystok cake” named after białystok poland where the ashkenazi jews first began making this genius creation bialys are similar to bagels they are made with the same dough but they are not boiled before hand nor are they rolled instead they are pressed and stretched creating a slight depression that is traditionally filled with poppy seeds and caramelized onions then baked the finished product is glorious bialys are unfortunately very hard to come by especially outside of new york city but guess what union bagel co just brought bialys to portland that’s right prepare to have your mind blown bialys are one of the greatest gifts the ashkenazi jews’ gave to the world besides gilda radner and they are sadly under recognized let’s change that   bialys are a weekend special here at union bagel we recommend having them with cream cheese and lox or if you are feeling particularly adventurous you can have it as an egg and cheese sandwich   thank you
