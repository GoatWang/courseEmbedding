log in     newpark mallnewark ca    here are the reasons why im giving this place  stars  the store is organized and stocked with merchandise  the styles are great  they have petite and tall sizes  the prices are affordable when its on clearance  the customer service isnt all that great  its hard to find help when you need it  the fittings rooms arent that clean floor overall i prefer to shop at express than here horrible horrible customer service came in to do a return and i had my receipt the african american lady gave me such a hard time honestly i felt discriminated but its every time i come to this new york a company i really miss the hayward one i would not shop here terrible customer service every time i go theres an employee who always chews gum very unprofessional and shes very unfriendly i went to return a few items and it seemed like she didnt know what she was doing one time i also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didnt want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it i try my best not to go to this new york and company its a bummer theres not another one closer to me i hate malls and i hate shopping for a purpose but i love shopping online and then returning in stores for free i love new york and company for some odd reason the price and quality is there they have really great deals if you catch them this store in newpark mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns one thing about it was when i did my previous return the person at the store asked why i was returning i said well wrong size shes like well if you shopped in person youd always get the right size im likeright i just shrugged and went on my merry way newpark mall was my old mall when i grew up its pretty much old and run down now but still is good for its purpose went to new park mall new york  company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses arrived the doors were closed  locked sale clerk approach  said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later after i walked over to macys to check out there dresses but i wasnt feeling on what was in stock within the  minutes passing i called over to new york  company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another  mins to reopen the way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true before you decide to go  shop perhaps people should call so they wouldnt have to be turned away im giving them  stars only because they have really nice clothes for work however the restrictions on their coupons are insane i went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured id take them since they were on red line marked down  off i almost never pay full price for items here unless i really love the piece so anyway i went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were since they were on sale she checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to  not including taxes mind you this was  shirt and  slacks the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt pshi left the clothes there and said no thank you maybe ill be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately horrible customer service i only buy clothes from new york and company lost the receipt for my city bucks too many stack together staple fell off i showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the new york and company credit card the supervisors response was we cant do anything without a receipt what happened to good customer service and common sense ill be shopping at the limited and express from now on here are the reasons why i give this place two stars good  selection of clothing and styles  certain outfits better than express  high quality material used  wellorganized bad  customer service see what a big difference it makes even though i listed more pros than cons the con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location atleast there was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable the other two ladies particularly one of them looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger meh thats a big disappointment i thought it was geared only towards me because one time i came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing however i went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line ridiculous beware i dont know her name and even if i did i dont intend to exploit an employee just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers i had such a worst experience here last week i returned  products and none of my returns got processed when i called the store manager and asked them about return they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount i did not receive a refund for  days after which i had to call both paypal and nyc company  times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my returngrrrr such inefficient employees work at this location i will never ever go to this store again even if i do i will make sure  times that they do their job well another time when i returned few dresses there associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store how crazy is thati spent  week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing  bucks this store sucks please think twice before you go and please make sure they do the job well as they suck badly i went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didnt have most of the dresses when i asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online as if i didnt know i could order online well i asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and i dont know if there is a small size i expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and dont expect a rude response they have moved the store to the st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if i see the same guy and lady i may give it another try but if i have a same experience then this store is out of my list i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a  i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size wtf does that mean if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff people now a days are soooooo funny just cant think outside the box i normally dont get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous i love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store its unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally i enjoy the store i highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else edited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock i am a loyal new york and company customer i buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company i have a charge account with you guys and through the years i am positive i have spent thousands of dollars i am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories i am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding

shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your

for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order the lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped i let her know that i was not happy that i had no communication about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really

fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants

nycbut its really not bad the salespeople were really nice and helpful and i managed to find myself  tops a skirt and some jewelry not bad for a tuesday this place reignited my love for nyc so much that i almost bought a coach knockoff purse that said ny ny ny all over it just to advertise for them the corporation still hasnt gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though youd think that class action lawsuit they lost wouldve done the trickbut apparently not just say no when they ask its all good did i mention i hate ghetto mall customer

great mall drmilpitas ca     i received the best customer service today at the new york  company store located at the great mall in milpitas i was shopping around for some tops leggings and pants and i popped into new york  company because they sent me a coupon for my birthday last week i thought to myself shoot i have no problem creating an excuse to go shopping for new clothes so off i went i was perusing the store and looking for my size and a young lady asked me if i needed any help finding my look or my size i usually do not ask for help but i am not too familiar with this store so the offer for assistance was warmly welcomed i shared with her that i needed a  regular and all i could find were either tall or petite or larger sizes so i thought i was out of luck she looked and we did not find my size so she quickly offered me a different fitting pant she found exactly what i was looking for even though i did not know it until i tried her suggestion perfect fit and this was a look i have never tried as i was in the dressing room trying on other items she knocked on the door and shared with me that she had found a smaller size in the original pant i wanted to try and did i want to see if they fit i thought no they will be too tight but she was persistent that i should try so i acquiesced and decided to try her suggestion wow was i happy i didanother perfect fit it is not often that i like everything i take into a dressing room but today was a wonderful win in the clothing department when i arrived at the register to pay the girl working the register rang me up i paid and then a little note came up on the creditdebit machine that read something about look for your birthday discount and it was at that moment i remembered my discount birthday card that new york  company sent me last week daaaaang  the cashier told me that those discounts do not apply to previous purchases and i could not use it but i thought that is kind of weird since the previous purchase was less than  seconds ago why can she not delete my purchase and apply my discount she called for her manager anna and that is when the wonderful girl who helped me in the back came up and totally

some kind of sale since it is an outlet store its a pretty decent sized store that caters to all your business attire needs they offer items from dress shirts cardigans dresses dress pants and also some causal attire like tshirts just a note their sizing is a little different i usually wear a m for dress shirts but for some reason a xs fits perfectly and a s is a little loose on me so i guess their clothing runs big but thats only for the dress shirts i have yet to try their other clothing i would definitely be coming back because its a great place to get your typical work clothes at an affordable price i have a love hate relationship with nyc i always seem to find really good deals online and then i spend all my moneythen i feel sad and happy all at the same time today i stumbled into the store and was greeted by a very friendly employee she told me about the extra  off for all items and an extra  on clearance well i beelined to the clearance and found myself a cute sweater and new work pants all for ish dollarswhat a steal its just a shame that they dont order things by size at all so unless you have the time or patience to sift through racks of clothes i probably wouldnt be back i was just lucky to find the items i did new york and company specializes mainly in womens business attire this location is more of an outlet so the clothes are wellpriced  especially when you manage to walk in on a storewide sale today nyc was on its last day of the columbus weekend sale and i made sure to take full advantage of the markdowns one of the best things about shopping at the great malls nyc has to be the amazing service the staff provides while i did not manage to catch the names of the girls that assisted me they have my eternal gratitude for helping make my days shopping experience wonderful the staff will ensure that your time spent in the store is painfree they will offer to take your items and reserve a dressing room for you when youre trying things on in

and theres always a multitude of sizes also since nycs focus is womens business attire you can pick up all your fashion essentials skirt pants blouse blazer dress etc here allinall todays experience has guaranteed my continued patronage can you say no place to wait awful customer service  so you go to buy clothes and while you are waiting for your partner to try on clothes you sit on the floor

mothers day ive worked in retail  know your susposed to have back up change not leave your cash paying customes waiting in line while you run to the bank to get change id never before shopped in a new york  co outlet store i was surprised that the prices werent lower sweaters for  in an outlet the day after christmas wasnt the best deal in town the jewelry was all marked down to  each but that wasnt something that i havent seen before in their regular store all in all it was a nice shopping experience with very pleasant employees but the prices were much higher than i expected the store was very neat and well lite but i was expecting lower prices new york and company is the worst company i have ever dealt with eastridge mall in san jose the worst store after battling months of chronic

only offered store credit when i ask if they could call customer service for me they said they cant call but they would give me a number to call of course the number was bogus and didnt allow you to speak with anyone i looked on the back of my platinum card and called customer service the person i talked with jenny on said i could have the merchandise recredited to my account and she would speak with whomever was helping me i put it on speaker and she told the girl to refill me and she would stay on the line and walk her through whatever steps so it would go through then she told the sales girl she could give me a merchandise credit the whole reason why i called platinum customer service was because i wanted it recredited to my account if this is how new york and company treats people

new york  company store located at the great mall in milpitas  i was shopping around for some tops leggings and pants and i popped into new york  company because they sent me a coupon for my birthday last week  i thought to myself shoot i have no problem creating an excuse to go shopping for new clothes so off i wenti was perusing the store and looking for my size and a young lady asked me if i needed any help finding my look or my size  i usually do not ask for help but i am not too familiar with this store so the offer for assistance was warmly welcomed  i shared with her that i needed a  regular and all i could find were either tall or petite or larger sizes so i thought i was out of luck  she looked and we did not find my size so she quickly offered me a different fitting pant  she found exactly what i was looking for even though i did not know it until i tried her suggestion  perfect fit  and this was a look i have never tried  as i was in the dressing room trying on other items she knocked on the door and shared with me that she had found a smaller size in the original pant i wanted to try and did i want to see if they fit  i thought no they will be too tight but she was persistent that i should try so i acquiesced and decided to try her suggestion  wow was i happy i didanother perfect fitit is not often that i like everything i take into a dressing room but today was a wonderful win in the clothing departmentwhen i arrived at the register to pay the girl working the register rang me up i paid and then a little note came up on the creditdebit machine that read something about look for your birthday discount and it was at that moment i remembered my discount birthday card that new york  company sent me last week daaaaang the cashier told me that those

content with cheap trendy and easily disposable items after all i could load up on tons of stuff and who doesnt love a deal what i didnt realize is that i was throwing money away times have changed and ive grown to value quality over quantity i love the quality of the clothes from new york  co my only gripe is that i am between sizes on the jackets but i have this issue everywhere finding a fabulous tailor is next on my to do list the sales associates at the eastridge location are super friendly helpful and honest the girls have helped me get the most value out of my purchases on numerous occasions which has caused me to spend a little more than i usually would the coupons are fabulous be sure to shop the buy  get   off sales and bring those coupons for even deeper discounts  off of a  purchase and the  off of a  are examples of the type of savings im taking about sign up online to receive coupons and notifications of sales youre welcome highlights affordable styles my shopping experience here started out good but turned sour i liked the fact that i was able to get a couple of shirts at an affordable price but at checkout the girl was super pushy and asked me  times after id told her no thank you each time if i wanted to apply for their damn credit card how many different ways can i politely say no i wont be returning to this store i didnt catch her name but her cashier id is  be aware of the pushy sales associate i usually dont leave review unless i really feel like its necessary for a place that i usually shop at and had good services this time it was poorly given especially by the store manager name daisydeisy i know holidays are really hectic and busy regardless of it that doesnt mean you service your customers poorly i went shopping here on  main reason was to make a return but i ended up shopping i switched my purse and wallet out few days ago and left my nyc credit card in my other wallet my mom and i ended up doing some shopping here and since i had the  reward which required me to use my nyc credit card the line was long with only one register available i patiently waited for a good amount of  mins by the time it was my turn daisydeisy had the biggest face ever without a smile hey i know you were probably tired and drained from the customers but the customers are also tired and drained from a long day at work and having to go to the mall for last minute presents and waiting in line everyone is tired i dont think you should give a big cranky face at the customers i asked her if she can look up my account since i dont have my card on me she called my account and loudly asked me to give her my last  digits of my social and repeated it loudly on the phone where other customers heard it she wasnt happy making the call and at the end she told this store will no longer look up account for security purpose and if i want to shop here i would need my card i know that many stores like macys nordstrom jcpenney and even target would gladly call to look up for your account even at the other nyc in oakridge mall most stores even ask you to write your last  digits down on paper for security purpose instead of repeating it loudly along with my numbers i asked her since when was this implemented and she said now with a big attitude tone to it i asked her whats your name and she said daisy im the store manager definitely a store manager with a big attitude regardless you are a store manager or a sales associate that doesnt mean you give poor customer service and my purchase was over  there wasnt a smile on her face throughout the whole purchase which i honestly think it matters for customer service i waited for a long time in line and she looked mad i dont care if you are store manager but if you are then you need to ensure customers satisfactory and the store runs well for the holidays i never had this experience before and i had also enjoyed shopping here horrible experience ever especially coming from a store manager who doesnt understand what customer service is i bought a pair of pants here during their  off sale shortly after thanksgiving weekend the jeans were originally  my ass they were not that great of quality but  was decent because they fit well when i brought them home and tried them on again i realized they had a real chemical smell that made me nauseous i tried to wash them but they still smelled on the third wash the color was completely faded and they still smelled i even washed them with vinegar yeah  my ass also the girl at the counter was soooooo rude i cant even believe it i almost left the pants at the counter it should have been a sign to leave the pants there she wanted me to sign up for a credit card or something and i declined and she pushed again and i declined after that she asked me to donate to some charity and when i declined she pushed again i declined again and she pushed who does that she got me to round up my purchase and donate a few measly cents to this charity she seriously ticked me off i am never going to this store again worst nyc ever worst customer service in store and their platinum service on the phone especially the customer service representative jenny i spoke with  from the eastridge store of course this was after i had to use my own phone to call because the manager on duty said they dont call customer service for their customers she then preceeded to give me a bogus number that didnt allow you to speak to anyone in customer service just directed you to their website i had to look on the back of my platinum card to find a number where you can speak with a horrible distespectful representative this company treats people with disabilities like they are trash they could truly care less i have been a customer for over  years but i will never shop with them again they have lost my business forever i highly recommend shopping at macys they have excellent customer service and always have good deals they actually listen and try to assist their customers my best recommendation never shop at a new york and company store or their website this was the first day i was actually physically able to shop they made what should have been a super happy day for me a stressful depressing shopping experience the service here is c grade i cant say much about their entire clothing line because i have not bought much from them however i was very disappointed with the supposedly leather belt that i bought from this store when i pointed out a couple of scratches on the belt to the clerk at the checkout counter she looked at me straight in the eyes and adamantly said that they a natural thing for leather products to my amazement the belt broke into two pieces two weeks after purchase i demand to know from new york company the source of manufacturing and a refund i get that they have long pants and jeans but what about the short and the skinny i cant fit their xsmall here its too bad they have so many cute clothes especially for workcareer they have suits and comfy casuals great accessories as well definitely for the adult in you i just wished i fit their clothing i will continue looking and dressing like a  year old  stars new york  co is where i shop to find work clothes  they have a great selection on business and casual attires and in the end it all comes out to a very affordable amount i say in the end because they always have deals where they take certain percentages off a certain amount purchased for example my mom and i shopped here last week bought like  items and  pairs of socks and it already came out to a little over  pretty pricey for me but i got a discount because i pulled up my email from nyco giving me  off any purchase over  woohoo my mom was able to get the same discount on her clothes too even if you dont shop here very often or even at all and youre not interested in signing up for an account which gives you even more discountssavings its totally ok  they always have some kind of deal going on right in the store no coupons necessary it was already a  pm  minutes after theyve already closed when we finished our purchase and the lady helping us was super nice and patient thank you to her and thank you to the other associate who played glee songs when the store was about to close  ill admit i started head bobbing singing and grooving a little while i was in the fitting room as a girl who stands  and is not quite as round as she is long it can be a real challenge for me to find pants that will fit me properly they are always either too baggy a hips or too dern short but not at new york  company this has been my go to place for jeans and other assorted pants for quite a few years now for a variety of reasons one because their tall pants are the perfect height and make me happy p two because they have several different cuts and washes of jeans that are all great on me and three because they have incredible sales and by incredible i mean incredible this weekend i meandered into the store and saw that they were having a pant sale for  jeans for  and kakhi pants for  and these are not the cheaply made pants that are going to wear out on you by the rd wash so you can be sure that i stocked up on all my pant needs this weekend  so why only  stars because i really dont use this store for anything other than their good deals on pants i shop here for one thing and one thing only long pants and jeans sure its great being tall at  i can reach things off of high shelves without help see over people at concerts go without heels etc there is one major drawback though and its that i can hardly ever find pants that are long enough if i buy regular pants they end up looking like clamdiggers and i end up looking like a nerd basically i need at least a  inseam which is hard to come by in womens clothing ny  co has a decent selection about  or  styles of pants that fit me so even if i cant stand the rest of the stuff in the store i can walk in and be comforted in knowing that i can walk out in a decent pair of jeans ankles unexposed to the world i live north of downtown and usually shop at valley fair or oakridge today i wanted to shop at  stores in particular and vf is the only other mall in the area that has all  i was not about to hit up vf on a saturday afternoon so i went on a little adventure to the east side yay this location is great the store was in great shape for a saturday afternoon even the clearance section was nicely organized i tried on a few things and a friendly sales girl helped me find additional sizes and even called around to other stores for me  ill while being super sweet about it if i need to shop at nyco ill come to this location before hitting up oakridge for vf rude rude and rude everytime i go to this store no one is greeting the customers and there are at least three workers standing around doing nothing maybe rearranging the jewelry they are no help you have to ask them for help and they just give a look like what i shop at ann taylor loft way nicer clothes and priced around the same dont bother with this store unless you dont want help i love this store they have really cute accessories and nice professional but stylish work clothes the staff is always very helpful and friendly new york  company unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the

following yvonne t  i usually dont leave review unless i really feel like its necessary for a place that i usually shop at and had good services this time it was poorly given especially by the store manager name daisydeisy i know holidays are really hectic and busy regardless of it that doesnt mean you service your customers poorly i went shopping here on  main reason was to make a return but i ended up shopping i switched my purse and wallet out few days ago and left my nyc credit card in my other wallet my mom and i ended up doing some shopping here and since i had the  reward which required me to use my nyc credit card the line was long with only one register available i patiently waited for a good amount of  mins by the time it was my turn daisydeisy had the biggest face ever without a smile hey i know you were probably tired and drained from the customers but the customers are also tired and drained from a long day at work and having to go to the mall for last minute presents and waiting in line everyone is tired i dont think you should give a big cranky face at the customers i asked her if she can look up my account since i dont have my card on me she called my account and loudly asked me to give her my last  digits of my social and repeated it loudly on the phone where other customers heard it she wasnt happy making the call and at the end she told this store will no longer look up account for security purpose and if i want to shop here i would need my card i know that many stores like macys nordstrom jcpenney and even target would gladly call to look up for your account even at the other nyc in oakridge mall most stores even ask you to write your last  digits down on paper for security purpose instead of repeating it loudly along with my numbers i asked her since when was this implemented and she said now  with a big attitude tone to it i asked her whats your name and she said daisy im the store manager definitely a store manager with a big attitude regardless you are a store manager or a sales associate that doesnt mean you give poor customer service and my purchase was over  there wasnt a smile on her face throughout the whole purchase which i honestly think it matters for customer service i waited for a long time in line and she looked mad i dont care if you are store manager but if you are then you need to ensure customers satisfactory and the store runs well for the holidays i never had this experience before and i had also enjoyed shopping here horrible experience ever especially coming from a store manager who doesnt understand what customer service is was this review … useful  funny cool charikay v san jose ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow charikay v stop following charikay v  i bought a pair of pants here during their  off sale shortly after thanksgiving weekend  the jeans were originally   my ass they were not that great of quality but  was

third wash the color was completely faded and they still smelled  i even washed them with vinegar  yeah  my assalso the girl at the counter was soooooo rude i cant even believe it  i almost left the pants at the counter  it should have been a sign to leave the pants there  she wanted me to sign up for a credit card or something and i declined and she pushed again and i declined  after that she asked me to donate to some charity and when i declined she pushed again  i declined again and she pushed  who does that  she got me to round up my purchase and donate a few measly cents to this

the eastridge store of course this was after i had to use my own phone to call because the manager on duty said they dont call customer service for their customers she then preceeded to give me a bogus number that didnt allow you to speak to anyone in customer service  just directed you to their website  i had to look on the back of my platinum card to find a number where you can speak with a horrible distespectful representative this company treats people with disabilities like they are trash they could truly care less i have been a customer for over  years  but i will never shop with them again  they have lost my business forever  i highly recommend shopping at macys  they have excellent customer service and always have good deals  they actually listen and try to assist their customers  my best recommendation never shop at a  new york and company store or their website this was the first day i was actually physically able to shop they made what should have been a super

work clothes  they have a great selection on business and casual attires and in the end it all comes out to a very affordable amount i say in the end because they always have deals where they take certain percentages off a certain amount purchasedfor example my mom and i shopped here last week bought like  items and  pairs of socks and it already came out to a little over  pretty pricey for me but i got a discount because i pulled up my email from nyco giving me  off any purchase over  woohoo my mom was able to get the same discount on her clothes tooeven if you dont shop here very often or even at all and youre not interested in signing up for an account which gives you even more discountssavings its totally ok  they always have some kind of deal going on right in the store no coupons necessaryit was already a  pm  minutes after theyve already closed when we finished our purchase and the lady helping us was super nice and patient thank you to her and thank you to the other

kristen m san jose ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow kristen m stop following kristen m  as a girl who stands  and is not quite as round as she is long it can be a real challenge for me to find pants that will fit me properly they are always either too baggy a hips or too dern short but not at new york  company this has been my go to place for jeans and other assorted pants for quite a few years now for a variety of reasons one because their tall pants are the perfect height and make me happy p two because they have several different cuts and washes of jeans that are all great on me and three because they have incredible sales and by incredible i mean incredible this weekend i meandered into the store and saw that they were having a pant sale for  jeans for  and kakhi pants for  and these are not the cheaply made pants that are going to wear out on you by the rd wash so you can be sure that i stocked up on all my pant needs this

i buy regular pants they end up looking like clamdiggers and i end up looking like a nerd basically i need at least a  inseam which is hard to come by in womens clothing  ny  co has a decent selection

room if needed line is moved quick at checkout the only con i can say is the fitting rooms can use a little sprucing up they are clean but missing a majority of the hooks to hang up your clothes or purse other than that two thumbs up for sure ny  co you might want to inform your new employees who chose to close the dressing rooms at  when the store is open to  that they are hurting your profits after being a loyal weekly shopper for over  years tonight i took my business across the way to banana republic because your employee literally rolled her eyes and scrunched her nose when myself and another customer questioned why all dressing rooms were closed in addition br employees apologized for your employees lack of service thats how you grow your profits the most pathetic brand and store i have ever seen i order an item online and but didnt like it because of improper fitting i called the store and the first lie they told me that i cannot return the product online and i have to come personally to store to return it when i went to store they gave me store credit the second lie they told me that i can gift that card to anyone if i dont want to use it whereas that card strictly says this card is a nontransferable card and the biggest lie was they told me that i can use that card for online purchase when i was trying to add that card to my account i couldnt add it because it can only be used in stores stop annoying people if you guys doesnt have knowledge then dont talk bullshit and stop lying i called and spoke with the store manager named victoria and she said that she can do an exception of changing the store credit to a gift card which i can use it online lets see how much truth it is will keep you guys posted in the meantime please be aware of their stupid and pathetic policies and lies i love this store they always have great deals and quality clothes i called the pleasanton location this morning using the app on my phone looking for black sailor pants with the buttons on the front i spoke to victoria and i inquired about these pants she found them in my size along with a couple of sweaters that i was looking for she told me she would put them on hold for me to pick up this afternoon she also looked up a couple of other items i was looking for they werent a available but its cool since i can get these online i came in as planned and victoria had everything ready that i wanted to purchase i found a nice sweater for  the other lady daysha who took over for victoria to finish ringing me up noticed their was a red stain on it and immediately assisted me with picking a duplicate of this sweater without the stain great looking out because not everyone pays attention to detail when ringing up customer purchases this sweater works well for me since i work in the city and you never know about the weather plus it will come in handy if the rain returns victoria and daysha were very professional and helpful im happy with my purchases i spent  saved  today woo who this is my go to store for work clothes im probably here at least once a month and always get great service the employees are friendly and helpful when i have a question or need to use the dressing rooms the store is also usually super clean and organized i also looooove all their sales the only downfall is walking in and wearing the same clothes that are hanging on the rack talk about moded lol its been a while since i visited this location but after walking in the store i realized why i was the first customer to enter once the employee rolled up the gate as i entered the staff looked me in my face and did not greet me or anything i couldnt even get a good morning shortly after another customer enters and words were exchanged by the same employee i assume this customer was greeted at that moment i wanted to walk out of the store unfortunately this is the only place of business that has the clothing i need to purchase at this mall i grabbed some clothes to try on and approached another employee brianna for her assistance she was very helpful and friendly she assisted me in picking out the proper size of clothing with no hesitation now that its time to pay the bill theres the initial employee at the register now wanting to have a conversation i really did not feel like speaking to her at this point she rang up my purchase which totaled almost  on my way out i stopped brianna and told her that she was the reason why i chose not to walk out of the store it was because of her that i didnt walk out and go to another mall please know that something like a greeting can go a long way i love this store because of their designs i work at doctors office so i always need to be dressed in semiformal attire everything in this store minus the athletic wear i can definitely wear to work black friday sales are good too on top of that they have sales literally from end of nov to early jan lots of differently sizes petite long regular which is very nice but its hard to find my size because im petite and everyone asian girl in the bay area is too  im writing in regards to the location in the sun valley mall i am not crazy about going to the sun valley mall however they do have some nice shops in there i have been coming here for years there clothes are not top quality though quality enough and seem to last fairly long this particular store always seems to have a great selection of sharp modern style chic clothes all the way from casual nice sharp looking work wear clothes and a descent selection of going out clothes and best of all they have a petite section store is bright and clean good service are a hit and miss here like any department store today service was especially helpful there is limited amount of fitting rooms though they are bright and large with good lighting a lol they have a descent selection of nice sharp new edge jewelry dont last particular long being a little cheap shoes look a little on the cheaper side as for everything else is stylish comfortable and seems to last pretty long depending how you care for it prices can be a little expensive however they are always having a lot of great sales have never been disappointed from the collection they have have never walked out empty handed i used to work here my whole side of the women in the family shop here it used to be a good experience everytime i walk in there but i think that everybody should work as one and everything should be divided evenly in work the clothes have a more younger look but it is nice plus there is always sales  overall everything is usually good for a customer shopping experience with the right employees i would recommend nyc i have to give  stars because its very clean and organized inside however they need to restock their sizes frequently im a loyal customer and have been shopping there for years in the serramonte one though i only go there twice a year june and december when the sales are a score i dont go otherwise i used to work here when it was called lerner ny and in most cases thats what i still call it they have my size petites average and tall can shop here its just the current set up nowadays can be hard for the eyes they dont shelve their pants any more in descending order according to size and shape like they used to i havent seen any jackets there either which they had a whole section of when i worked there soive never really shopped here before always just looked in the window but my friend had a return so i mosey on in and of course found something to buy when i wasnt going to buy anything a way cute raincoat that was black and white plaid and is was  off so how could i resist it will be perfect for those surprise rain showers when i go to nyc in a few weeks and ill definitely be stylin now and then a belt and a purse for  off so cute and the girl behind the counter was really helpful and got me signed up for free coupons so ill come back and spend more money of course all in all the service was good and the sales girls very friendly and helpful some great sales and cute cute stuffoh yeah ill be back the music at the store is too loud every time i go in it makes for a frustrating shopping experience i feel like i can not hear myself think i also think the aisles are to small for a stroller i know that not everyp erson in the world has to shop with a stroller but i do and i wish the walkways were less hard to get threw the sale racks int he back possibly clearance area is stuffed with stuff it make the shop look messy when you head back to the back of the store there is nothing worse than a messy shop it makes me feel frantic when i am shopping there are good deals to be had when you shop there but it seems like i am struggling to find reason to go back anytime soon i have been coming to this place since high school every time i need a nice work shirt so i have been in this store  times this month the first two i bought  shirt each time same style different color  dollars each i bought the second one because i decided i didnt like the first ones color on me but i didnt have it at the time to return i came back the third time coming out from san francisco where i live i grew up in pleasanton thats why i was out here the first two times specifically to return this shirt with my receipt even giving my boyfriend money for gas to drive me out here i go in tell the sales associate i bought two of the same shirts but decided i didnt like this color and she scans my receipt and said this shirt is not on this receipt shit i grabbed the receipt for the second shirt i explain politely that i live in san francisco and i grabbed the wrong receipt could she just do the refund for this one she said no offered me a  dollar refund instead and i said fine i am not coming out here from san francisco again when the manager told me that there is one in san francisco how could i have not known i looked for one on yelp and their website there is one in san francisco no there is one in daly city the sales associate had the nerve to tell me it would probably be easier to get to that one from where i live then to the pleasanton one bitch what this is what i said what am i gonna do walk from the nearest sf bus stop to get to the daly city one anybody who has lived for any amount of time in sf or daly city knows how separate they are so i took by  dollar refund oh wait no i didnt they forgot to mention i only get store credit does anybody want it because i dont seriously screw this place same shirt different color thanks for giving me a good fuck nyc btw i bought the shirt for a job interview because i have been out of work since making the move to sf buying these shirts put my bank account into double digits luckily i got the job i get paid for the first time in  weeks maybe i can use my store credit to buy food until then the clothes are v inexpensive and quite a few are cheaply made however they have great sales like everything is  off so if you see something you like dont you dare pay full price when i went here the customer service left much to be desired we waited over  minutes in line we were th from the register bottom line worth picking through be prepared to wait if youre shopping on a weekday afternoon wow im so glad i decided to walk in this place today i was on my way to forever  as i usually walk right past this place because for some reason i thought it was for the more mature crowd hehe but i was also looking for something more professional today and decided to see what they have to offer they had a great sale going on and i think almost everythings on sale like  the signs said selected styles and at first i thought oh another scam just a few items are really  but i saw a shirt i really liked and it had no markings on it that it was on sale when i asked the register lady which was super nice by the way she said yup its only  and the jewelry was only  bucks down from  that was selected styles but others were  off i was really happy and lets just say that this store unexpedtedly took up an hour of my  hour slot dedicated to forever  if you want express like clothes but less workish and more daytime and more affordable with a great staff then come in here whoo hoo got a pair of earrings  neckalaces a cuute belt a nice button shirt and a long white tunic for  bucks new york and company unclaimed

discriminated but its every time i come to this new york a company i really miss the hayward one i would not shop here terrible customer service every time i go theres an employee who always chews gum very unprofessional and shes very unfriendly i went to return a few items and it seemed like she didnt know what she was doing one time i also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didnt want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it i try my best not to go to this new york and company its a bummer theres not another one closer to me i hate malls and i hate shopping for a purpose but i love shopping online and then returning in stores for free i love new york and company for some odd reason the price and quality is there they have really great deals if you catch them this store in newpark mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns one thing about it was when i did my previous return the person at the store asked why i was returning i said well wrong size shes like well if you shopped in person youd always get the right size im likeright i just shrugged and went on my merry way newpark mall was my old mall when i grew up its pretty much old and run down now but still is good for its purpose went to new park mall new york  company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses arrived the doors were closed  locked sale clerk approach  said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later after i walked over to macys to check out there dresses but i wasnt feeling on what was in stock within the  minutes passing i called over to new york  company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another  mins to reopen the way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true before you decide to go  shop perhaps people should call so they wouldnt have to be turned away im giving them  stars only because they have really nice clothes for work however the restrictions on their coupons are insane i went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured id take them since they were on red line marked down  off i almost never pay full price for items here unless i really love the piece so anyway i went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were since they were on sale she checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to  not including taxes mind you this was  shirt and  slacks the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt pshi left the clothes there and said no thank you maybe ill be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately horrible customer service i only buy clothes from new york and company lost the receipt for my city bucks too many stack together staple fell off i showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the new york and company credit card the supervisors response was we cant do anything without a receipt what happened to good customer service and common sense ill be shopping at the limited and express from now on here are the reasons why i give this place two stars good  selection of clothing and styles  certain outfits better than express  high quality material used  wellorganized bad  customer service see what a big difference it makes even though i listed more pros than cons the con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location atleast there was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable the other two ladies particularly one of them looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger meh thats a big disappointment i thought it was geared only towards me because one time i came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing however i went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line ridiculous beware i dont know her name and even if i did i dont intend to exploit an employee just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers i had such a worst experience here last week i returned  products and none of my returns got processed when i called the store manager and asked them about return they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount i did not receive a refund for  days after which i had to call both paypal and nyc company  times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my returngrrrr such inefficient employees work at this location i will never ever go to this store again even if i do i will make sure  times that they do their job well another time when i returned few dresses there associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store how crazy is thati spent  week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing  bucks this store sucks please think twice before you go and please make sure they do the job well as they suck badly i went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didnt have most of the dresses when i asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online as if i didnt know i could order online well i asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and i dont know if there is a small size i expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and dont expect a rude response they have moved the store to the st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if i see the same guy and lady i may give it another try but if i have a same experience then this store is out of my list i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a  i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size wtf does that mean if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff people now a days are soooooo funny just cant think outside the box i normally dont get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous i love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store its unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally i enjoy the store i highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else edited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock i am a loyal new york and company customer i buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company i have a charge account with you guys and through the years i am positive i have spent thousands of dollars i am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories i am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem i am extremely disappointed hazel at the store was very helpful she helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order the lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped i let her know that i was not happy that i had no communication about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really like most of their styles and they have a good range of them too the prices are affordable and they are always offering specialssalesand promotions their striped collared shirts are my faveplus they have tall size pants and petitethank god not so good  theres usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register if you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once and the shirts are the same even if you heavily starch them march   update it pains me to do sobut i have to knock off a star i dont know what theyre doing with their fashionsbut its got to stop the last  to  times ive been there i have found nothing that i wanted to buy nothing pleasethe last thing anybody wants at the beginning of spring is a black dressso why do you have  different ones nobody is going to buy those and why is everything else white is white in fashion again when was all that white stuff in fashion i cant remember original may   review new york  company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite lerner new yorkbut the last time i was at a lerner ny it was still different even though its my favorite store i walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because its in ghetto mall and ghetto mall gap is crap well i just couldnt do it yeah in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal nycbut its really not bad the salespeople were really nice and helpful and i managed to find myself  tops a skirt and some jewelry not bad for a tuesday this place reignited my love for nyc so much that i almost bought a coach knockoff purse that said ny ny ny all over it just to advertise for them the corporation still hasnt gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though youd think that class action lawsuit they lost wouldve done the trickbut apparently not just say no when they ask its all good did i mention i hate ghetto mall customer service is horrible when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem i cant believe how bad experience i had with them new york  company unclaimed

place  stars  the store is organized and stocked with merchandise  the styles are great  they have petite and tall sizes  the prices are affordable when its on clearance  the customer service isnt all that great  its hard to find help when you need it  the fittings rooms arent that clean floor overall i prefer to shop at express than here horrible horrible customer service came in to do a return and i had my receipt the african american lady gave me such a hard time honestly i felt discriminated but its every time i come to this new york a company i really miss the hayward one i would not shop here terrible customer service every time i go theres an employee who always chews gum very unprofessional and shes very unfriendly i went to return a few items and it seemed like she didnt know what she was doing one time i also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didnt want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it i try my best not to go to this new york and company its a bummer theres not another one closer to me i hate malls and i hate shopping for a purpose but i love shopping online and then returning in stores for free i love new york and company for some odd reason the price and quality is there they have really great deals if you catch them this store in newpark mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns one thing about it was when i did my previous return the person at the store asked why i was returning i said well wrong size shes like well if you shopped in person youd always get the right size im likeright i just shrugged and went on my merry way newpark mall was my old mall when i grew up its pretty much old and run down now but still is good for its purpose went to new park mall new york  company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses arrived the doors were closed  locked sale clerk approach  said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later after i walked over to macys to check out there dresses but i wasnt feeling on what was in stock within the  minutes passing i called over to new york  company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another  mins to reopen the way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true before you decide to go  shop perhaps people should call so they wouldnt have to be turned away im giving them  stars only because they have really nice clothes for work however the restrictions on their coupons are insane i went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured id take them since they were on red line marked down  off i almost never pay full price for items here unless i really love the piece so anyway i went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were since they were on sale she checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to  not including taxes mind you this was  shirt and  slacks the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt pshi left the clothes there and said no thank you maybe ill be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately horrible customer service i only buy clothes from new york and company lost the receipt for my city bucks too many stack together staple fell off i showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the new york and company credit card the supervisors response was we cant do anything without a receipt what happened to good customer service and common sense ill be shopping at the limited and express from now on here are the reasons why i give this place two stars good  selection of clothing and styles  certain outfits better than express  high quality material used  wellorganized bad  customer service see what a big difference it makes even though i listed more pros than cons the con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location atleast there was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable the other two ladies particularly one of them looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger meh thats a big disappointment i thought it was geared only towards me because one time i came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing however i went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line ridiculous beware i dont know her name and even if i did i dont intend to exploit an employee just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers i had such a worst experience here last week i returned  products and none of my returns got processed when i called the store manager and asked them about return they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount i did not receive a refund for  days after which i had to call both paypal and nyc company  times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my returngrrrr such inefficient employees work at this location i will never ever go to this store again even if i do i will make sure  times that they do their job well another time when i returned few dresses there associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store how crazy is thati spent  week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing  bucks this store sucks please think twice before you go and please make sure they do the job well as they suck badly i went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didnt have most of the dresses when i asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online as if i didnt know i could order online well i asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and i dont know if there is a small size i expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and dont expect a rude response they have moved the store to the st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if i see the same guy and lady i may give it another try but if i have a same experience then this store is out of my list i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a  i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size wtf does that mean if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff people now a days are soooooo funny just cant think outside the box i normally dont get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous i love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store its unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally i enjoy the store i highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else edited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock i am a loyal new york and company customer i buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company i have a charge account with you guys and through the years i am positive i have spent thousands of dollars i am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories i am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem i am extremely disappointed hazel at the store was very helpful she helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order the lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped i let her know that i was not happy that i had no communication about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really like most of their styles and they have a good range of them too the prices are affordable and they are always offering specialssalesand promotions their striped collared shirts are my faveplus they have tall size pants and petitethank god not so good  theres usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register if you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once and the shirts are the same even if you heavily starch them march   update it pains me to do sobut i have to knock off a star i dont know what theyre doing with their fashionsbut its got to stop the last  to  times ive been there i have found nothing that i wanted to buy nothing pleasethe last thing anybody wants at the beginning of spring is a black dressso why do you have  different ones nobody is going to buy those and why is everything else white is white in fashion again when was all that white stuff in fashion i cant remember original may   review new york  company is supposedly the same as my all time

giving them  stars only because they have really nice clothes for work however the restrictions on their coupons are insane i went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured id take them since they were on red line marked down  off i almost never pay full price for items here unless i really love the piece so anyway i went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were since they were on sale she checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to  not including taxes mind you this was  shirt and  slacks the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt pshi left the clothes there and said no thank you maybe ill be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately went to new park mall new york  company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses arrived the doors were closed  locked sale clerk approach  said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later after i walked over to macys to check out there dresses but i wasnt feeling on what was in

give us another  mins to reopen the way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true before you decide to go  shop perhaps people should call so they wouldnt have to be turned away i hate malls and i hate shopping for a purpose but i love shopping online and then returning in stores for free i love new york and company for some odd reason the price and quality is there they have really great deals if you catch them this store in newpark mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns one thing about it was when i did my previous return the person at the store asked why i was returning i said well wrong size shes like well if you shopped in person youd always get the right size im likeright i just shrugged and went on my merry way newpark mall was my old mall when i grew up its pretty much old and run down now but still is good for its purpose here are the reasons why i give this place two stars good  selection of clothing and styles  certain outfits better than express  high quality material used  wellorganized bad  customer service see what a big difference it makes even though i listed more pros than cons the con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location atleast there was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable the other two ladies particularly one of them looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger meh thats a big disappointment i thought it was geared only towards me because one time i came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing however i went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line ridiculous beware i dont know her name and even if i did i dont intend to exploit an employee just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my

about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a  i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size wtf does that mean if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff people now a days are soooooo funny just cant think outside the box horrible horrible customer service came in to do a return and i had my receipt the african american lady gave me such a hard time honestly i felt discriminated but its every time i come to this new york a company i really miss the hayward one i would not shop here terrible customer service every time i go theres an employee who always chews gum very unprofessional and shes very unfriendly i went to return a few items and it seemed like she didnt know what she was doing one time i also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didnt want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it i try my best not to go to this new york and company its a bummer theres not another one closer to me i had such a worst experience here last week i returned  products and none of my returns got processed when i called the store manager and asked them about return they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount i did not receive a refund for  days after which i had to call both paypal and nyc company  times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my returngrrrr such inefficient employees work at this location i will never ever go to this store again even if i do i will make sure  times that they do their job well another time when i returned few dresses there associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store how crazy is thati spent  week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing  bucks this store sucks please think twice before you go and please make sure they do the job well as they suck badly i went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didnt have most of the dresses when i asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online as if i didnt know i could order online well i asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and i dont know if there is a small size i expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and dont expect a rude response they have moved the store to the st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if i see the same guy and lady i may give it another try but if i have a same experience then this store is out of my list i am a loyal new york and company customer i buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company i have a charge account with you guys and through the years i am positive i have spent thousands of dollars i am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories i am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem i am extremely disappointed horrible customer service i only buy clothes from new york and company lost the receipt for my city bucks too many stack together staple fell off i showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the new york and company credit card the supervisors response was we cant do anything without a receipt what happened to good customer service and common sense ill be shopping at the limited and express from now on i highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else edited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock customer service is horrible when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem i cant believe how bad experience i had with them new york  company unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the

it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock customer service is horrible when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem i cant believe how bad experience i had with them im giving them  stars only because they have really nice clothes for work however the restrictions on their coupons are insane i went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured id take them since they were on red line marked down  off i almost never pay full price for items here unless i really love the piece so anyway i went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were since they were on sale she checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to  not including taxes mind you this was  shirt and  slacks the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt pshi left the clothes there and said no thank you maybe ill be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately went to new park mall new york  company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses arrived the doors were closed  locked sale clerk approach  said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later after i walked over to macys to check out there dresses but i wasnt feeling on what was in stock within the  minutes passing i called over to new york  company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another  mins to reopen the way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true before you decide to go  shop perhaps people should call so they wouldnt have to be turned away i hate malls and i hate shopping for a purpose but i love shopping online and then returning in stores for free i love new york and company for some odd reason the price and quality is there they have really great deals if you catch them this store in newpark mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns one thing about it was when i did my previous return the person at the store asked why i was returning i said well wrong size shes like well if you shopped in person youd always get the right size im likeright i just shrugged and went on my merry way newpark mall was my old mall when i grew up its pretty much old and run down now but still is good for its purpose here are the reasons why i give this place two stars good  selection of clothing and styles  certain outfits better than express  high quality material used  wellorganized bad  customer service see what a big difference it makes even though i listed more pros than cons the con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location atleast there was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable the other two ladies particularly one of them looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger meh thats a big disappointment i thought it was geared only towards me because one time i came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing however i went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line ridiculous beware i dont know her name and even if i did i dont intend to exploit an employee just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order the lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped i let her know that i was not happy that i had no communication about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a  i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size wtf does that mean if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff people now a days are soooooo funny just cant think outside the box here are the reasons why im giving this place  stars  the store is organized and stocked with merchandise  the styles are great  they have petite and tall sizes  the prices are affordable when its on clearance  the customer service isnt all that great  its hard to find help when you need it  the fittings rooms arent that clean floor overall i prefer to shop at express than here alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really like most of their styles and they have a good range of them too the prices are affordable and they are always offering specialssalesand promotions their striped collared shirts are my faveplus they have tall size pants and petitethank god not so good  theres usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register if you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once and the shirts are the same even if you heavily starch them march   update it pains me to do sobut i have to knock off a star i dont know what theyre doing with their fashionsbut its got to stop the last  to  times ive been there i have found nothing that i wanted to buy nothing pleasethe last thing anybody wants at the beginning of spring is a black dressso why do you have  different ones nobody is going to buy those and why is everything else white is white in fashion again when was all that white stuff in fashion i cant remember original may   review new york  company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite lerner new yorkbut the last time i was at a lerner ny it was still different even though its my favorite store i walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because its in ghetto mall and ghetto mall gap is crap well i just couldnt do it yeah in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal nycbut its really not bad the salespeople were really nice and helpful and i managed to find myself  tops a skirt and some jewelry not bad for a tuesday this place reignited my love for nyc so much that i almost bought a coach knockoff purse that said ny ny ny all over it just to advertise for them the corporation still hasnt gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though youd think that class action lawsuit they lost wouldve done the trickbut apparently not just say no when they ask its all good did i mention i hate ghetto mall i normally dont get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous i love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store its unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally i enjoy the store hazel at the store was very helpful she helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great

customers i had such a worst experience here last week i returned  products and none of my returns got processed when i called the store manager and asked them about return they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount i did not receive a refund for  days after which i had to call both paypal and nyc company  times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my returngrrrr such inefficient employees work at this location i will never ever go to this store again even if i do i will make sure  times that they do their job well another time when i returned few dresses there associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store how crazy is thati spent  week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing  bucks this store sucks please think twice before you go and please make sure they do the job well as they suck badly i went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didnt have most of the dresses when i asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online as if i didnt know i could order online well i asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and i dont know if there is a small size i expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and dont expect a rude response they have moved the store to the st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if i see the same guy and lady i may give it another try but if i have a same experience then this store is out of my list i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes i visited this nyc store and it was just sad aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was

they are always courteous i love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store its unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally i enjoy the store i highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else edited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock i am a loyal new york and company customer i buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company i have a charge account with you guys and through the years i am positive i have spent thousands of dollars i am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories i am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem i am extremely disappointed hazel at the store was very helpful she helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was

listed in born to shop i got an online coupon for  off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one  basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes  i visited this nyc store and it was just sad  aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray  i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out  i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any  no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious  they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it  i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where  she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms  i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants  i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a   i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair  when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size  wtf does that mean  if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for  i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff  people now a days are soooooo funny  just cant think outside the

highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house i had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store but it was available online the clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere elseedited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater

again alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really like most of their styles and they have a good range of them too the prices are affordable and they are always offering specialssalesand promotions their striped collared shirts are my faveplus they have tall size pants and petitethank god not so good  theres usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register if you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once and the shirts are the same even if you heavily starch them march   update it pains me to do sobut i have to knock off a star i dont know what theyre doing with their fashionsbut its got to stop the last  to  times ive been there i have found nothing that i wanted to buy nothing pleasethe last thing anybody wants at the beginning of spring is a black dressso why do you have  different ones nobody is going to buy those and why is everything else white is white in fashion again when was all that white stuff in fashion i cant remember original may   review new york  company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite lerner new yorkbut the last time i was at a lerner ny it was still different even though its my favorite store i walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because its in ghetto mall and ghetto mall gap is crap well i just couldnt do it yeah in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal nycbut its really not bad the salespeople were really nice and helpful and i managed to find myself  tops a skirt and some jewelry not bad for a tuesday this place reignited my love for nyc so much that i almost bought a coach knockoff purse that said ny ny ny all over it just to advertise for them the corporation still hasnt gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though youd think that class action lawsuit they lost wouldve done the trickbut apparently not just say no when they ask its all good did i mention i hate ghetto mall customer service is horrible when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem i cant believe how bad experience i had

off after spending  and i already had a gift card for  so i figured i couldnt lose on this one  basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes  i visited this nyc store and it was just sad  aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray  i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out  i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any  no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious  they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it  i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where  she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms  i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants  i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a   i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair  when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size  wtf does that mean  if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking

under  i thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information when i received the confirmation email a few days later i realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number i called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do since the item already shipped she advised that i wait until the item was returned to them call them back and place a new order that was irritating i hadnt heard anything in a couple of days and couldnt access any shipping information online so i called customer service again this lady told me that i should have called ups originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly she told me to call usps apparently ups transfers the package to usps and find out what happened she was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time ive wasted at work with this issue i called usps and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender so now i will have to call ny  co customer service yet again at this point there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available had i known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldnt enter an apartment number i would have just ordered it online myself save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere elseedited to add i just spent  mins on the phone with ny  co customer service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that i cant get it i am so sad about this it was such a unique color and it doesnt sound like the sweater will come back in stock was this review … useful  funny cool

am normally pretty happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day  i paid almost  for the shirt  as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors  this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee  i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt  she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick  let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through  and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back  i am baffled  i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper  honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem   i am extremely disappointed

happy with the service at the store but i bought a blouse which i plan to wear for valentines day i paid almost  for the shirt as i am getting ready to go out i put my normal perfume and i noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors this has never happened before with any of your clothes so i brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager andee i explained to her what happen as i never even got to wear the shirt she started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how i had to be careful with my perfume and that i had stained the shirt with my lipstick and that the shirt had other stains on it lets begin with the fact that i dont even wear lipstick let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through and the fact that i never go to wear the shirt in the first place how can you not take it back i am baffled i explained to her that i bough clothes all the time at the store and she basically told me that she didnt care i was pretty shocked so i walked away and then when i came back and asked her what her name was she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper honestly i a seriously thinking if i should ever buy your clothes again if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem i am extremely disappointed hazel at the store was very helpful she helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom ask for hazel shes awesome the ladies that work here are great very friendly  helpful i love the options of clothes they have and they fit great i love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable st of all i was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online nd i received a confirmation for my online order and thats it i received an email that said i would receive my order in  days after  days past i went online to hunt for my order status when i attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered thats it so i had to call customer service and they advised me i had  item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order the lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped i let her know that i was not happy that i had no communication about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order the nyc online experience was not as good as jcp macys or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status i could not find anything on yelp for their online shopping so that is why i am writing the review on the site i like the store experience and hate the online experience needless to say i will not shop online at nyc again alrighty ive got some good and bad with this place good  i really like most of their styles and they have a good range of them too the prices are affordable and they are always offering specialssalesand promotions their striped

questions about merchandise or need a fitting room take a number and get in line  while their prices are very affordable as the saying goesyou get what you pay for i dont mean the apparel falls apart or anything but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once and the shirts are the same even if you heavily starch them march   update it pains me to do sobut i have to knock off a star i dont know what theyre doing with their fashionsbut its got to stop the last  to  times ive been there i have found nothing that i wanted to buy nothing pleasethe last thing anybody wants at

its my favorite store i walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because its in ghetto mall and ghetto mall gap is crap well i just couldnt do it yeah in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal nycbut its really not bad the salespeople were really nice and helpful and i managed to find myself  tops a skirt and some jewelry not bad for a tuesday this place reignited my love for nyc so much that i almost bought a coach knockoff purse that said ny ny ny all over it just to advertise for them the corporation still hasnt gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though youd think that class action lawsuit they lost wouldve done the trickbut apparently not just say no when they ask its all good did i

figured i couldnt lose on this one  basically spend about  bucks out of pocket and get  worth in clothes  i visited this nyc store and it was just sad  aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for veterans day they also had cash rewards sales their selection was very poor they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray  i managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out  i didnt want to go into the fitting rooms and when i looked around for a mirror to try it out i didnt see any  no mirrors in a female clothing store are you serious  they have more mirrors at payless shoes than they do at nyc i could not believe it  i had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where  she pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms  i still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didnt add up to the  so i decided to look at their skinny pants  i saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a  but i needed a   i looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for  off so i figured why not get the second pair  when i asked a different sales rep if thats all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes she looked me up and down and said but we should have your size  wtf does that mean  if i asked her if thats all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that i did not find the size i was looking for  i just shook my head grabbed a sweater instead
