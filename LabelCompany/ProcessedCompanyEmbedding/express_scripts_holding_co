wentworth  express scripts holding co thanks ben and good morning everyone before eric discusses our financial results i want to briefly reinforce our strong position in a dynamic environment and share examples of how our focused independent model is delivering innovative sustainable outcomes for clients and patients every day we see another unexpected headline or an added degree of uncertainty to the health care policy environment however regardless of politics or policy agenda one thing is clear the need to effectively manage health care spend is front and center for payers who want to provide affordable benefits as labor markets tighten and insurers compete for members who are increasingly focused on the value they receive for every dollar spent our role has become even more significant in this context even in a year when drug price inflation has somewhat moderated payers need help navigating the pipeline of innovative treatments being brought to market as well as the already high price tag of many existing drugs express scripts is uniquely positioned as a clinically focused scaled partner for our  clients and their members our dedication to innovation in pharmacy creates better value for payers and greater access for patients increasingly we are demonstrating that we can drive valuebased outcomes in pharmacy aligning payers patients and those pharma companies who want to provide greater value as we look out over the next three to five years we see a number of key value levers emerging including further evolved valuebased contracting strategies comprehensive management of specialty pharmacy the emergence of biosimilars innovative plan designs and the use of large scale data sets to drive better behavior and outcomes these strategies powered by our unique assets including our therapeutic resource centers our home delivery pharmacy our accredo specialty pharmacy and our supply chain management expertise will continue to drive our innovation and create patient access nearer term in this quarter we showed the breadth and flexibility of our model in this quarter alone we entered into a novel group purchasing organization agreement with walgreens boots alliance development where we can procure generic drugs at a lower cost and continue to do so well into the future we launched inside rx a program that will more directly deliver savings to cash paying patients at the point of sale while providing discounts at the point of sale is not new with inside rx we convened retail pharma and a technology partner to provide significantly lower costs for cash paying patients we collaborated with several key health plan clients to launch smartshare rx which enables patient and drugspecific rebates to be offered to our pbm members at the point of sale for payers our smartshare rx solution gives them enhanced flexibility to offer plan designs that match their growth and patient engagement strategies we introduced a novel opioid solution which leverages a number of our unique capabilities to help patients who are newly prescribed opioids in our pilot study which we conducted with a bunch of our clients we reduced hospitalizations by  we reduced er visits by  and we decreased average supply of opioids by  our approach helps ensure patients get the medicine they need while curbing overprescribing and overuse and it helps our clients with this national problem also in this quarter we acquired mymatrixx an innovative leader in workers compensation which expands our leadership in this important area of pharmacy management finally we will be launching a cvsanchored retail network option for our diabetes care value program offering yet another flexible choice to our clients as we manage this critical area of spend these are just a few examples of how our independent model uniquely enables us to work across the supply chain and beyond in full alignment with our clients best interests another key driver of value for us and our clients is our national preferred formulary approximately  million members are covered by this formulary and it is the largest managed formulary in the united states you are familiar with the generic wave that drove significant savings and value in the s and still does today but given the proliferation of new branded products entering the market over the last few years today we are in the midst of what i would call the formulary wave fueled by multiple competing branded products in virtually every therapy class our national preferred formulary is just one example of how active management of the pharmacy benefit continues to create extraordinary value for our clients while ensuring patients get what they need next week we will release our  national preferred formulary list where we expect to provide  billion in value to our clients whats even more important is that we will do this while ensuring greater than  of patients will experience no change we deliver maximum savings with minimum disruption exactly what our clients want in the five years ending with  im proud to say we have delivered more than  billion in cumulative savings to clients through our national preferred formulary as we have stated this formulary is predominantly used by commercial clients today with most health plans managing this area themselves however this year an increasing number of our health plan clients are relying on our scale and our negotiating expertise and are leveraging us to manage formulary deliver greater value and help them compete weve earned their trust and will continue to do so by delivering real value supported by our strong clinical and patientfocused model and our innovative approach to valuebased contracting of course brand formulary management is only one of several levers that we use to drive low net costs looking at a couple of significant spend categories a bit deeper we expect the net cost per prescription from  to  to decrease by  per year on average in diabetes and by  annually in respiratory this is not only driven by formulary exclusions but is powered by new generics specialized care utilization management protocols channel management and valuebased contracts our innovative approach comprehensively manages complex expensive classes of medications that is delivering value beyond to our clients and their patients from a renewal perspective we are not satisfied where we sit today overall there have been several cases in our book specifically in the state government segment that have moved this year as a result we are revising our full year retention rate guidance to a midpoint of  with a range of  to  that said we are pleased with our results in several key market segments importantly our performance in our health plan and federal business renewals has been very strong with virtually  retention additionally our commercial business has also had an exceptional year with renewals we have also seen strong enrollment across our book in our valuebased solutions including safeguardrx and our day programs from a new sales standpoint we are encouraged by our results in what is a lighter selling season than average as you may recall a number of meaningful opportunities we expected to compete for have been pushed out in fact while this year is light there are nearly  billion adjusted prescriptions expected to be in play for january   and january   combined we are actively engaged with this longerterm pipeline and are optimistic about the early indications we are receiving in fact we had  prospects attend our recent outcome symposium they collectively represented  million adjusted prescriptions our solution resonated well and positions us for an ongoing differentiated dialogue with these prospects every member of my team and i are laserfocused on taking great care of our existing clients and their patients while ensuring that our innovative resultsdriven solutions differentiate us in a marketplace where we are well positioned to grow i will now turn it over to eric to provide insight into our financial performance eric r slusser  express scripts holding co thank you tim and good morning everyone we are pleased to report second quarteradjusted earnings per share of  which represents an increase of  over last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range our adjusted claims for the quarter were  million also above the midpoint of our guidance range we also saw adjusted sga decrease  over last year as our leadership team continues to be focused on cost management we generated  billion of ebitda consistent with previous years this quarter includes approximately  million of incremental revenue and operating income related to the structure of our anthem contract excluding the impact from the anthem contractual payment ebitda for adjusted claim is  up  over last year our core pbm ebitda grew  in the quarter and  yeartodate this increase is due to the acceleration of supply chain initiatives including our successful generic procurement process as well as cost management while we expect core pbm ebitda growth to continue in the second half of the year it will moderate slightly due to the certain cost benefits that occurred in  that are not expected to repeat in the second half of  from a cash flow perspective we generated  billion of net cash flow from operations up  over last year we also repurchased  million shares for approximately  billion during the quarter share repurchases were made through a combination of both open market purchases and a b plan we are very pleased with our financial performance year to date which leads us to our  updated guidance we continue to expect  adjusted claims to come in at a midpoint of  billion generating expected ebitda of  billion at the midpoint of our range  over  adjusted ebitda we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year from a range of  to  to a new range of  to  this represents growth of  to  at the midpoint of the range our increased guidance is primarily attributed to the management of our capital structure we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of  million to  million in the second half of  our diluted share range balances additional share repurchases with debt payment along with potentially making strategic acquisitions and leaving some cash on the balance sheet to pay off maturities coming due in the first quarter of  this approach allows us to maintain our leverage targets from now through  with respect to the third quarter of  we expect adjusted eps to be in the range of  to  up  to  yearoveryear finally i want to spend a couple of minutes talking about our new multiyear enterprise value initiative we are launching an enterprise value initiative to make us more efficient and a better partner to those we serve as we look ahead this effort should position us to better compete in the future and offset some of the impact from anthem in  and beyond we expect to invest  million to  million which should generate savings in the range of  million to  million annually savings will be driven by our investments to eliminate unnecessary work automate processes improve quality lower our cost to fill for prescriptions at both home delivery and accredo rationalize our footprint and improve our administrative operations we have four main objectives under our enterprise value initiative first we will be improving patient engagement by increasing investment in our digital assets we are advancing solutions that make it easier for patients to make the best choices as we evolve our mobile app more patients will use it which creates a better experience and makes it easier to work with us higher levels of selfservice improved net promoter scores and reductions in rework and phone calls position us to more efficiently deliver the service our patients expect we have already reduced the number of calls per home delivery prescription by over  in the last year and expect to further reduce that figure in the coming years second we will be improving position engagement through better data integration and technology enablement we will better integrate electronic medical records and electronic health records to provide important clinical data to physicians at the point of care and facilitate a significant improvement in the number of automated prior authorizations we process each year our goal is to double the number of electronic prior authorizations and also to significantly increase the rate of electronic prescribing these investments will increase patient and physician satisfaction reduce manual intervention and deliver better care third we will be creating a better client experience we will speed implementation of complex plan designs improve data reporting and enhance the onboarding experience for new members by improving our automated setup process we will decrease manual processes more rapidly implement benefit design changes and deliver greater value finally we will be improving our cost efficiency by driving down our cost structure eliminating work automating processes and optimizing our business we will deliver better care to patients and greater savings to clients we are building a company that will be more nimble and agile our new investments will improve our productivity generating more value for those we serve we are still refining our detailed plans for all of our enterprise value initiatives and expect to provide updates on future earnings calls so weve covered a lot of ground today to sum it up we delivered  in adjusted earnings per diluted share an increase of  over q of  we continue to see strong response to our differentiated product offerings and business model and finally we are executing on a path to growth by strategically investing in our future to evolve our organization at this point well be happy to take questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is coming from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan maam your line is open lisa your line is now open kindly check if youre in mute once again lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is now open maam benjamin bier  express scripts holding co operator we can go to the next call and come back to lisa she may have just stepped away thanks operator the next question is from rob jones goldman sachs your line is now open robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co llc great thanks for the questions tim just wanted to start with the retention and the change in expectations for the year if i look at the marketplace the expected anthem departure the fact that it seems like you lost a few of the state level contracts this selling season do you feel theres a need to rethink the approach to retaining clients and maybe bidding on new clients just from the outside looking in it does seem like others might be being more competitive aggressive in the marketplace right now timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co thanks for the question bob and what id say is first of all we always – we evaluate every time we win or lose and try to understand and learn from it and this year is certainly a year where were doing that i would tell you that as i said in my prepared remarks when i look at the bids this year that weve been successful in – lets talk about renewal first its across virtually every market segment except the state bids and the state bids this year wed be in the range we originally gave you if not for two recent announcements that were very disappointing to us when we look at those those are bids that you dont have a lot of incumbency in value youre bidding on those without the opportunity to have back and forth with your client and so youre having to decide to go in blind a little bit and what i will tell you is we are looking very hard at what should we have done differently in those cases theres one case that we are actually not satisfied with the process and weve made it clear to the state in that case but you know what weve got to compete and win in those processes and were looking very hard at that but our other renewals were very pleased with sort of the way its played out the market is very competitive as you know we had some very large cases that weve been very pleased to keep across the book and again our overall retention outside of the states is as strong as its been if not stronger so we arent going to overcorrect here but were always evaluating what we need to do to go forward thats why what eric announced this morning as it relates to our enterprise value initiative is so critical as a piece of the puzzle we recognize we have competitors that are streamlining getting more aggressive and smarter about how they run their business weve got to do the same thing with ours and i can tell you thats a longstanding sort of way that we go about things here that were doubling down on as we look forward in terms of new business just to touch that for a second we had a good new business year with the exception of corner cases but most of the corner cases we were looking to compete for didnt actually come out this year and so we do see sort of the next two years as years where weve got to come in strong be competitive bring value but not do that in a way thats not responsible robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co llc got it and just talking about some of the investments you and eric touched on in the prepared remarks it sounds like youre investing in the user experience and trying to improve the home delivery process and it does seem like that will be a homegrown initiative any thoughts on partnering there tim to accelerate the improvement in the client experience and specifically im thinking about home delivery timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co what i would say is everything is on the table for us as you saw last quarter we did a lot of really interesting partnering across the piece to attack a number of different opportunities and when we look at home delivery im not going to name any one sort of approach that we may or may not take to it i can tell you this that as we look at it its a great asset it sits inside of a number of the safeguardrx programs and continues to when i look at something like our recently announced goodrx collaboration with inside rx to go after cashpaying patients for example there may be some opportunities there when i look at what we do in digital we actually collaborate already with certain folks outside our company to again build that out in a longer term way so the answer is everything is on the table as we build our plans and look at how to optimize every part of our business to deliver for patients and payers long term robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co llc great thanks appreciate it operator thank you next is from lisa gill from jp morgan maam your line now is open okay moving forward to our next question from garen sarafian citigroup your line is now open garen sarafian  citigroup global markets inc good morning tim and eric first just to touch on retention again tim i understand the reasons why you updated the retention number but looking forward for the rest of the year what does the  bake in so how confident are you that that is the lower end of the range how conservative is it i guess whats still up to renew to give us the level of confidence timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure thanks for the question i wont name names what ill say is weve got a couple of good sized cases that are out that we feel good about quite frankly but we decided in abundance of caution to give you the range that would envision sort of what i would call pretty near to a worstcase scenario i hope next quarter – well i intend next quarter to sit back down with you and probably tighten that range up and my goal is that we nail down this last one or two and be well positioned i will tell you this again we have a lot of discussion as you might imagine about the range because the  that we have at the midpoint was in our old range but we just concluded that given that we had a couple of disappointing recent losses we would be more responsible to show you what the low end could look like again were not targeting that as you could imagine garen sarafian  citigroup global markets inc got it okay and then just changing gears a little bit on the wbad partnership guidance doesnt seem to contemplate any contribution for this year i broadly understand how aligning the contracts take time but could you elaborate a little bit more on why theres not more of a contribution from mays announcement for this year timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure ill start and then if everett neville who heads up supply chain especially for me has anything to add ill ask him to jump in what ill say is this we just sent people to switzerland about a week ago were getting this off the ground and i would also remind you that we waited until we had completed our own generic bid before then sort of doing the final arrangement with wbad because we felt it was important to be sure that what we came to the table with was our best work that we could then judge how much value we could create incrementally off of what we already were able to achieve ourselves and i believe they probably did the same thing and so when you look at that you realize there may be some small amount of opportunity that we can create this year by going back out and working some of the contracts but the majority of the work both of setting it up and then of sort of harvesting the future opportunity with the value that our combined volume creates is really an  phenomenon garen sarafian  citigroup global markets inc okay everett neville  express scripts holding co i completely agree with that and echo that the other factor given that we just completed our generic process the clean room process that we had run is probably not accurate and therefore we havent used it to forecast and were in the process of redoing that there may be some fourth quarter value but were targeting  for most of that value garen sarafian  citigroup global markets inc but it sounds like its more of a – its process related not necessarily contractual obligations that prevent you from achieving savings sooner timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co thats correct garen sarafian  citigroup global markets inc okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question is from john kreger william blair your line is now open john c kreger  william blair  co llc hi thanks very much tim if you can think about the lower and upper end of your range for retention for next year what would that translate into kind of total claims based upon what you know now in  flat or down a little bit if you could just elaborate on that that would be helpful timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure obviously i know you wont expect me to give you  guidance i would tell you that if we came in at the low end of the range or frankly coming in the middle of the range i would expect given the selling season its early because weve got plans that are out themselves winning and we wont have some of the line of sight to our health plan success in the market weve been helping them win quite a bit yet but i would tell you that it would be likely that we would be flat to down somewhat slightly i guess would be how youd characterize it that being said we dont talk about ebit retention versus claims retention that does not translate into a dampening of our view that our  to  long term guidance and our  push is going to be dramatically changed by that because again these accounts that we did not keep the state accounts they tend to be priced very deeply they tend to particularly in the first year not significantly contribute to ebitda you obviously like them for the long term and you hope you can obviously move them to a pathway of profitability but while you see claims down somewhat youre not going to see us talk about as a reason that we would be coming in with guidance that would be otherwise disappointing john c kreger  william blair  co llc great thank you and it looked like your wording around anthem was pretty much the same as it was on the first quarter release but any change that you can update us on here timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co yes so what i would say is probably nothing thats material but weve had some back and forth correspondence id talked about that last quarter between myself and anthems ceo last week we did receive the pricing portion of their rfp inhouse were working through the details of that and plan to respond accordingly its a fairly short time line we believe were the best option for them still but i want to be really clear that – not to get too excited about the fact that weve received any portion of that rfp it has not changed our assessment of our odds at this point at all in terms of renewing them certainly not since last quarter have we reassessed those as being any better but we are certainly happy to give them something to consider and were taking it seriously but thats probably as much as ive got beyond that the litigation process continues and we expect discovery to go through the end of  john c kreger  william blair  co llc great thank you operator thank you and next question is from charles rhyee cowen  company your line is now open charles rhyee  cowen  co llc yes thanks hey tim you mentioned earlier in your comments around the national formulary in terms of – you talked about that  billion in savings when the new formulary comes out i guess two questions first what is the change in terms of clients adopting the national formulary that youve seen so far for next year maybe you can give us a reference on what percentage of clients have been adopting this you did talk about the health plans maybe can you talk about what percentage of your health plan customers have been adopting the national formulary just trying to get a sense on what the opportunity there is in that regard thanks timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure thanks and again ill let everett jump in here what id say is this for us weve got virtually our entire commercial book thats enrolled in the national preferred formulary the large midsized employers and its performed well and the stickiness is virtually  we dont have clients back out of the formulary from year to year and as i said in my prepared remarks when youre delivering – last year we delivered less than  or less than  disruption this year what were going to be showing clients next week is on average  or less the clients have seen that were able to make the changes without disrupting members and the members that would be affected weve been able to manage very effectively with our therapeutic resource centers so weve had  virtual stickiness in that we definitely have had clients come into it as well as on the commercial book and in the cases were winning because were winning quite a bit in the middle market now thats the standard bid that we bring and those employers almost all come in for the national preferred formulary as it relates to health plans its the early innings weve had a couple of them actually adopt for certain lines of business i think its important to understand that our health plan clients have multiple lines of business but in their commercial space in particular and particularly those that have large national account commercial populations those are the ones weve been working with to either in the case of a couple blues plans implement the formulary verbatim or work with them in key therapeutic chapters where theyre able to leverage our negotiating scale and prowess to incrementally create value for themselves and so what id say is weve had i think four health plans that we are now managing their formulary for them where they were before managing that and obviously weve got another dozen and a half large ones that we would hope to ultimately be able to deepen the relationship that we already have with them i dont know if you want to add any color to that everett neville  express scripts holding co theres not a lot to add the only other factor would be that those clients that cannot adopt our national preferred because of their benefit design maybe a union contract many of them are taking components of the national preferred so theyre taking pas or theyre doing something in a therapeutic class that mimics what were doing in the national preferred in order to get that value timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co i would just echo that by way of example i can think of a very large health plan that we have that does their own formulary but when hepatitis c became an active category for management they cut their own deal and then ultimately wound up coming back and leveraging ours instead and producing value for them and for us as they engaged with us to do that thats one example so the thing i would point out because were making it sound a little bit more sort of in series than it really is is we have with all of our health plans ongoing conversations about formulary and look to where we can augment their strategy or in fact as we have again for several large ones this year step in and actually manage it for them charles rhyee  cowen  co llc great let me just follow up obviously you had a nice step up in the core growth of the business in terms of ebitda can you give us a sense on particularly in the back half of the year for the rest of the year guidance and particularly since you gave third quarter guidance what should we kind of assume for core growth perhaps thanks eric r slusser  express scripts holding co yes this is eric as i mentioned in my prepared remarks were very pleased with the second quarter at  the second half of the year given the significant cost reductions we had in  the yearoveryear comps because of those cost reductions will cause that to moderate some but the things that will drive that the high side to low side certainly to the extent volume is up in both mail and accredo we also have a couple of generic launches that are teetering between  and  and depending on whether they come in early obviously weve rolled out a lot of new programs as tim talked about to the extent the adoption of those continues like it has been theres upside opportunity our enterprise value initiative to the extent we can generate savings early in that process provide upside and then as tim and everett talked about the possibility that there may be potentially a fourth quarter upside from the wbad contract so those are kind of some of the tailwinds that could drive it to the higher the headwinds fortunately not a lot certainly any slowdown in utilization would be a headwind and then finally us not hitting our cost targets but we are good at that we are very focused on that and so again we feel good about the second half which is reflected in both our guidance and our increase in guidance for the year charles rhyee  cowen  co llc okay thanks a lot operator thank you and our next one steve valiquette bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open steven j valiquette  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning tim and eric thanks for taking the question so i think at this point its quite early to have a thorough discussion around amazon as a player in the pharmaceutical supply channel but just to the extent that they may have some desire to try to dispense drugs on a large scale through home delivery they would obviously need access to networks and reimbursements i guess to that end just curious if its the natural instinct of express scripts to perhaps not want to allow other home delivery providers into its pharmacy networks to avoid losing market share or would express be willing to reimburse a company like amazon for dispensing home delivery drugs just curious to get your initial thoughts round this timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co its a great question what i would point to sort of as an evidence point of our thinking is how weve evolved our thinking around day programs that are omnichannel and so as i think about amazon and what they may choose to do in pharmacy you said it right in the beginning which is you know becoming a pbm is a lot more than dispensing drugs in fact becoming a pbm requires you to figure out how not to dispense drugs or to dispense the right drugs as much as it does to dispense them so its a long pull to become a pbm but if amazon were looking to be an efficient provider in networks we would welcome that opportunity we would certainly make sure that there were lots of boxes checked that would enable our members to have access to good quality care but from our perspective we can still wrap our trcs around as we do our retail partners we can wrap our trcs around those patients our therapy resource centers we think amazon is a great client for us we think they are obviously a company that if they choose to move in a direction wed be interested in working with them steven j valiquette  bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful color thanks operator thank you and our next question is from erin wright credit suisse your line is now open erin wilson wright  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great thanks on capital deployment can you speak to some of the opportunities in adding assets in integrity fraud and abuse capabilities and what that could add to your platform and how do you weigh these opportunities relative to workers comp which you recently did a deal in and specialty as well and then just broadly do you view there is more of a sense of urgency now to be active on the ma front relative to maybe even what you were thinking three months ago thanks timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure thanks let me answer the last half first which is three months ago i made pretty clear that we were engaged in ongoing conversations as you would expect a company of our size with our cash to be and our position in a very dynamic market on ma and that has not changed so we had amped up this year our engagement and we continue to be highly engaged in a pipeline of opportunities to your question as it relates to specifically using data safety fraud waste and abuse it is certainly an area that is good for our clients its good for us we can build as well as potentially look to integrate other solutions that may be in the marketplace if you look at what we did this quarter in opioids both for our clients with the large launch that we did as well as for the state of missouri what well be doing more locally it leverages a lot of our existing capabilities our existing data our ability to integrate with patients through specialist pharmacies to create significant outcomes that are being bought by our clients now the clients reaction to our opioid solution has been very very strong and thats a service theyre paying for so we do think there is build and potentially buy opportunities in the space broadly defined as payer services utilization controls and management integrity fraud waste and abuse and those sorts of things but we do like being able to invest in ourselves too we have a lot of the core assets and relationships that enable us to do a great deal erin wilson wright  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great and can you speak to the cvs diabetes care program you alluded to how has this feedback been in the early stages of the diabetes program how are you expecting enrolled lives to trend over the next year thanks timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co yes thanks so obviously we are really pleased with the ability to work across multiple players in the space including both walgreens and cvs as two anchor stores and we have clients who naturally would profile to choose one or the other of those anchors based on their population and so forth and so for us it was a natural extension to take the program that we had with the tools that we bring to it but also with what we were going to be able to get retail to support as it relates to both rates and care and be able to offer as it were an anchor either way which would then broaden the number of clients who would look at a program from a disruption standpoint and be able to make it easier to sell through to those patients those clients on the edge weve had very good sellin of our initial launch of our diabetes care value program we believe that this newly anchored program which really is a clone will then broaden a bit further the number of patients and clients that were able to serve with that i dont know everett if there is anything you want to add everett neville  express scripts holding co the only thing i would add is the diabetes safeguardrx was the first safeguardrx program that we have that had a retail component and so we were able to work that through with walgreens they were open to taking some risk quite frankly in working with us and as such we were able to sell that almost for a year now – about ten months we recently have reached agreement with cvs to do the same thing we have about a little over  million lives in the diabetes care to date i would expect less than that in the cvs but well begin selling that we havent officially begun selling that well begin selling that here in the next couple of months erin wilson wright  credit suisse securities usa llc broker excellent thanks operator thank you and our next one lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is now open lisa gill  jpmorgan chase  co i hope that the third time is the charm timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co yes we can hear you we got you lisa gill  jpmorgan chase  co i okay great so first let me start with – if i go back to last quarter you talked about core growth in your core pbm of  to  growth and tim and eric if i recall correctly you talked about getting towards the upper end of that range that you needed the retention rate to be towards the upper end of your  to  as we think about now  and even going forward how important is retention versus plan design so tim it sounds to me like what youre talking about today is a lot of different programs are resonating with existing clients and that you have lost some state government business that may not adopt all of these programs so i just want to try to frame how to think about how important retention is versus how important plan design is as we move forward timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure thanks for the question what id say is what we said last quarter specifically was that volume or utilization which would include retention was in the  to  number for us roughly  basis points of sort of movement one way or the other and i would not give you a different number today that being said – and so that would lead you to believe that plan design is more important and there is no question that innovating and driving down our clients trends and selling programs into our clients that produce value for them and value for us is the key element of the business model that said from our perspective  or better retention has always been sort of in my time in the business kind of what you had to target you recognize that there was some natural churn in the middlemarket you recognize that there were a few cases that would move any given year that you always hate it but it happens and hopefully youd get some as well but what i would tell you is we take retention really seriously because i believe even in those states that we lost we ultimately if we are innovative enough we will find things to sell to them and that will take us up or above the top end of the range and so those losses dont take us off of that  to  at all the losses that we had this year but i would tell you this retention over the next three years is important to us and we are going to drive hard against it we have had a couple good years of retention leading up to this one i wasnt going to give you a two or threeyear average of retention to feel good about myself because this year isnt where we want to be but i think over the threeyear period we have got to show retention because quite frankly that broadens your ability to sell lisa gill  jpmorgan chase  co great and then my second question just your comments on anthem finally sending you the rfp is there any color you can add to that were there back and forth conversations between yourselves and the anthem management team that finally brought this to fruition or was there something else just curious on the background of that timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co well i can only speak from our side which is a little bit of the two things i would point to is one that we have continued with the discovery and process and feel good about that process and we are about to begin the process of interviewing folks and so there is that element of it which i cant speak to beyond that and then there is other that we feel very good still about our position in that lawsuit as it relates to the rfp itself all i would say is that there has been an exchange of communications between myself and joe that ultimately led to i believe lead to the receipt of the pricing portion of the rfp what id say is this though lisa daytoday our teams are working really well with anthems team anthem has great people that we interface with weve got great people that service anthem we continue to – they did some changes july  that went very well our it folks are well integrated with each other to help when things are connected and theyre doing new things so from a standpoint of the relationship its very functionally good at the executional level and i think that im optimistic that they will ultimately conclude with the right party although my odds are still very low because ive had nothing in my communications back and forth to suggest that theyre biased in our direction lisa gill  jpmorgan chase  co thanks i appreciate that thank you operator next question brian tanquilut jefferies your line is now open brian gil tanquilut  jefferies llc hey good morning tim just to follow up on one of your comments to lisas questions so you mentioned something about if you were innovative so where do you stand today as really the true stand alone or the sole stand alone in the industry how do you feel about the need to evolve the company into something else given that whether its through innovation or partnering or vertically integrating into something else timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co so i feel a very strong need over the next three years to evolve this company there is no question our enterprise value initiative i think is a strong signal of that because that is a lot more than just you know changing our footprint or swapping out workforces or being a little bit more efficient and as it relates to our openness to work with others in novel ways i think last quarter you saw some evidence at least that we are very open to working with others i can tell you we have conversations that are – its early stage conversations with very interesting ideas as it relates to people we can work with to either help solve their problems or do things together were in a great space in pharmacy given where things are apt to strongly evolve our model as the market needs evolve biosimilars are one example of that i sat with a ceo of a major top  pharma company that is a significant player in biosimilars and we talked about some very interesting ways everett and i met with him this week or i guess it was last week to think through how we could bring some things to the market in innovative ways so from our standpoint the thing i like about our focused model is it is all we talk about internally is what else can we be doing with our asset with our relationships with our strong ability to manage patients and outcomes and therefore you should expect that we will continue to do things like we did in the second quarter brian gil tanquilut  jefferies llc got you and then eric as i look at the results the anthem book looked to have weakened in terms of margins this past quarter is there anything you would be able to call out in terms of the drivers there and as i think about the enterprise value initiative should we think of that as the savings primarily flowing through to the nontransitioned part of your book or do you need some of those savings to essentially get to the anthem ebitda that youre reporting today eric r slusser  express scripts holding co yes so let me answer the first part of that the biggest change in the margin which affects the total company and the anthem yearoveryear is the annual contract trueup payment that we get in the second quarter and if you look at that last year versus this year this years payment was almost half of last years so that decrease is whats driving that yearoveryear margin thing from the evi perspective and the initiative certainly part of this is driven by the impacts as weve said whether anthem rolls off or the rates get reduced theres an impact to our margins come  or  but as you listened to what we talked about all the things were doing the majority of these evi initiatives we would be doing regardless of anthem the plus side is theyre going to drive out a significant amount of costs that will offset some of that impact were going to see in  and  so certainly its a driver but were doing this as i said to be more competitive to improve our company and help us better serve our patients clients and customers brian gil tanquilut  jefferies llc i appreciate that thanks guys operator thank you next question ricky goldwasser morgan stanley your lines now open ricky r goldwasser  morgan stanley  co llc yes good morning thank you for taking my call so just one followup on the enterprise value initiative just to clarify if you were to under a scenario were to lose anthem will the cost savings figure increase eric r slusser  express scripts holding co no there is a moderate amount built into that savings number as it relates to anthem variable cost so if they stay it could be slightly lower but right now our plan the assumption is driven by them rolling off in  and  ricky r goldwasser  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats helpful and then if we think about the  growth algorithm the  to  longer term – i think you talked earlier about the fact that we shouldnt think about the script growth and translate it necessarily to what you can do on the ebitda line so how should we think about how much of that  to  growth would come from cost cutting and wbad versus other factors that might make up for the script loss timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co so ill start ricky first of all i want to be really clear that the  to  was over a threeyear period and so for next year we havent actually given the guidance but we certainly are working toward coming in at a range that people are going to feel good about and excited about that said the things that are going to drive us next year to come in high in that range for next year when we put our guidance out will be – the volume piece as i said is a relatively modest piece of it it is going to be about driving supply chain value it is going to be about getting cost out of the business in ways that transform us eric talked about a lot of them i mean next year if we can knock another  calls per  off of our mail service call volume for example were going to have happier members and were going to have a smaller footprint in terms of folks who are having to talk to patients about wheres my order and those kinds of things if we can move our eprior authorization up and begin to take a significant crack as we have the last two years those are the kind of things that are going to drive a lot of our cost initiatives next year we have a good line of sight to some new generics and some other things in the supply chain that we think are going to drive that were delayed this year that we think will drive client value as well as our ability to get to the top end of the range and then again as i said im very optimistic based on the uptake rates that weve have seen both in our safeguardrx programs and in our day programs that were positioning ourselves for a fairly strong year in  i dont know if eric is there anything you want to add to that eric r slusser  express scripts holding co no that covers it ricky r goldwasser  morgan stanley  co llc and then one last question on the selling season i know weve all been focused on retention rates but can you talk a little bit about the profiles the accounts that youre winning in the selling season timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co yes so what i would say is its been very good for us in the commercial market this year weve been very pleased with that market the large health plan market is pretty much – theres been nothing material that i can think of off the top of my head thats actually moved a lot of that got pushed out into  or  as plans sort of were waiting to see whats going to happen with washington were assessing their own strategies and so forth so theres been less there less government and unfortunately we actually have won in the state space as well as some of the local school districts and local municipalities and those kinds of things we did win one state account that we talked about but unfortunately its not as big as the ones we lost we happen to have probably more of the states that were out than our competitors did this year so thats why i think we – and ive heard at least one competitor kind of describe it as kind of a light year this year ricky r goldwasser  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you operator thank you next question anthony vendetti maxim group your line is now open anthony v vendetti  maxim group llc thank you just to follow up on anthem you said in a filing that if you were to resign with anthem it would be on terms significantly less favorable im just wondering when did you receive the pricing rfp from anthem and is that the full rfp and when do you have to respond and just elaborate a little bit more on why you think the terms would be significantly less favorable did they put some guidelines in that rfp timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co sure so let me start with weve been saying that since long before we received the rfp and ill explain why in just a second but to answer your question in very specific terms we received the pricing portion last week were going to be returning it they would like it back this friday and we intend to try to hit that date and beyond that i wont characterize it in any way were going to respond to what they have asked us for as it relates to the step down that we would anticipate which is why this enterprise value initiative is so important because even keeping anthem as you will recall in  the arrangement that we and anthem entered into was a very unique arrangement it was a purchase of their pbm it had other facts and circumstances around it contractually that will not be in place come the renewal the renewal or  and beyond for us if were fortunate enough to receive it or if they go some other place will be a sort of commercially competitive bid that theyre entitled to go get because they will need to move their business from us to whomever gives them that bid or keep their business with us which is why we think were the right choice but we will have to compete at that point in sort of a traditional services bid assuming thats the direction they even go so from that standpoint recognizing that today and we disclosed in the last quarter the kind of earnings we would have on anthem you would be well aware that those sorts of earnings per script are not what you would typically see in the more traditional pbm bid so we would not expect to see our profit continuing post  anthony v vendetti  maxim group llc okay just a quick followup so right now the ebitda per script is significantly higher than it is for your core business but that was because back in  you paid an upfront fee to anthem which they used for various corporate purposes themselves including repurchasing shares so thats why its so high now in your traditional bid you would expect it to be more in line or because its such an important contract maybe less than the average ebitda per script correct timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co broadly speaking thats correct thats what i would say yes thanks anthony v vendetti  maxim group llc all right thanks timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co and operator well take one more call please i know were closing in on  eastern operator thank you and our next question from michael cherny ubs your line is now open michael cherny  ubs securities llc good morning guys and thanks for taking the question i think the question was asked earlier today about the evolution of the market and obviously with noise around new players such as amazon potentially coming in as you think about potential partnerships with nontraditional players against the backdrop of how you reposition the company i know you talked about technology investments how does that all factor into this longterm evolution of the standalone pbm model of making sure that whats historically been a primarily btob business can create some differentiation with btoc type applications and i guess along those lines where do you think right now the industry you included falls short on the btoc side timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co yes its a big question i mean what i would say is i think that our independent position in the marketplace is exactly the right position to be in now as you evaluate a very dynamic health care market a very dynamic consumer market and you look at our ability to flexibly work with players gain last quarter i can point to some stuff again the answer i gave you earlier on amazon something that were not resistant to these sorts of potential opportunities if they benefit our clients and our patients thats the bottom line and so – or as we showed this quarter with inside rx patients who are not ours but need the kind of things that we can bring to the market ie these cash paying customers i think that when you look at sort of our population and the members that we directly serve they are well served by what we do but they have a very high standard from what they expect from everybody in their life and that standard has been – theyve acquired that sort of view from working with really smart digital companies who make things very frictionfree and very seamless and thats why as we look at when we do and the investments that were going to make a key component of those investments its not the only thrust but the key component involves this whole notion of the patient we have a thing we call the patient journey here that we believe we can take a tremendous amount of cost out of but more importantly we can make a heck of a lot easier theres no question that paying for phone calls that people dont want to make for patients that we could otherwise serve in more efficient ways is a winwinwin and so we think we can do a lot of that from our internal piece but i can tell you as well again leveraging technology partners leveraging potentially other branded partners we think theres a lot we can do working with the retail channel using their brand where it makes sense if you look at some of the programs we have launched so again what i like about our model is we are able to work across the piece without being beholden to a particular asset that we are attached to and the second piece is i am really proud of the team of  employees that work for this company who are driven to actually be innovative and drive at continuing to evolve our model michael cherny  ubs securities llc and just one really quick technical question for eric you had talked about ma and capital deployment given what youve already done on buyback and with the debt maturity next year what are your capacity constraints about pursuing ma is there anything in particular we should be thinking about as we try and assess what areas you could think about moving in to eric r slusser  express scripts holding co well really as we have talked about before a lot of what were focused on would be things that would be most likely cashdebtrelated acquisitions so from that perspective we dont see any nearterm constraints we can manage those and still manage our capital structure that we built into our longterm growth guidance michael cherny  ubs securities llc okay thanks timothy c wentworth  express scripts holding co guys i thank you for dialing in today we really appreciate you hanging with us this morning and we obviously had a lot to go over were really pleased with what were looking forward to doing and i look forward to coming
