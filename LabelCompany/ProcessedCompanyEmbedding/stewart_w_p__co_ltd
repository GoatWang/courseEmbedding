identified in this prospectus wp stewart  co ltd will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common shares after the offerings are completed the selling shareholders current and former employees and directors and other affiliates of wp stewart  co ltd will own approximately  of the issued common shares of wp stewart  co ltd we believe that currently only a limited number of companies with a similar investment philosophy and practice compete directly with us in our core business of providing wealth management services to the upper tier of the wealth management market however the investment management business in general is intensely competitive in providing investment management services we compete with a large number of asset management firms as well as brokerdealers trust companies commercial banks and other specialized wealth management providers our future growth and profitability will be affected by our ability to retain and increase our market share which could be adversely affected over the longer term as competitors seek to develop high networth relationships many of our current and potential competitors are significantly larger in terms of capital assets geographic presence distribution network and other important business criteria provide a wider range of services and may have access to greater financial resources than the stewart group company description overview the stewart group offers researchintensive equity investment management services worldwide central to our success are three interdependent competitive strengths  culture investment methodology and performance record we foster team effort collaboration and a comprehensive focus on achieving superior portfolio performance the longterm commitment between the stewart group and our employees is evidenced by our performancebased compensation policies employee stock ownership and the tenure of our employees the culture is a key factor in our ability to implement over an extended period of time an investment methodology that requires intense shared continuous research and debate these elements have contributed to a  compound annual return before fees for client accounts over the  years from january   to december   see  historical performance record while investment performance is our primary focus asset gathering is also important to our business we have developed mutually beneficial relationships with select institutions and individuals to accumulate new assets we will continue to cultivate longterm relationships with our current network of marketers and to establish relationships with additional marketers for additional asset gathering finally we intend to continue to pursue a global strategy both in our research effort and in the expansion of our client base competitive strengths we believe we have a franchise culture longterm historical performance record and investment methodology that position us well to continue to compete in the global wealth management business we have built a business model we believe is unique and have developed and successfully implemented our disciplined investment philosophy over the past  years our experienced investment team consists of  investment analystportfolio managers with an average of more than  years of experience in the industry eleven of our analystportfolio managers have worked at the stewart group for five years or longer with six offices around the world and a selective network of marketing relationships in more than  countries we have established an international presence and offer services to a broad range of high networth individuals and institutions throughout the world culture we place great emphasis on teamwork and client service cooperation is reinforced through a profit sharing plan and equity ownership by every employee all employee compensation is based solely on a percentage of the firms annual operating profits our policy is not to pay fixed salaries or to guarantee compensation every employee owns common shares of wp stewart  co ltd which have been accumulated through voluntary personal investments immediately after the offerings individuals who are our current and former employees and directors and affiliates of us and such individuals will own approximately  of our outstanding common shares as a policy we neither grant options nor issue shares to employees without consideration we intend to continue our performancebased compensation practice and to reserve annually up to  of our outstanding common shares for purchase by our employees all employee stock purchases have been and will continue to be subject to seven year vesting because of the seven year vesting employee stock purchases will be made at prices which represent fair value but which will be below the current market price it is our present intention to continue to make available common shares for purchase by our employees in proportion to their relative contributions to the stewart group see management  compensation of directors and officers we believe that a key to our continued success is our highly motivated team of experienced investment professionals each acts in the dual role of analyst and portfolio manager with every investment portfolio handled by an individual manager backed up by at least one other manager to provide continuity and stability the group of analystportfolio managers is relatively small a structure we intend to maintain the investment professionals meet regularly and are able to interact quickly informally and effectively all of our investment professionals share a common commitment to both the demanding standards required to invest only in the worlds best companies and the discipline of our appraisal process all of them have a record of successful investing and most of them have either known each other or worked closely together for many years their investment performance and tenure show them to be a complementary and effective team longterm performance record during the year period from january   through september   we experienced a  compound annual return before fees and a  compound annual return after fees and expenses compared to a  return for the sp  index for the same period see  historical performance record the year ended december   was the only year since our inception that we experienced negative performance we believe that our longterm record and strong investment returns provide an advantage in our efforts to accumulate assets through strategic marketing relationships client referrals and increases to existing client mandates as a result of retained investment gains as well as the contribution of new funds by existing and new clients our assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately  during the period from december   to december   investment methodology our investment professionals focus on one objective  providing our advisory clients with well aboveaverage investment returns over a long period of time while accepting what we believe to be belowaverage risk in making investments the investment team focuses on a fiveyear investment horizon and does not engage in market timing we believe that our investment research is distinguished by its intensity our analystsportfolio managers do their own research on companies they select and on many they do not select and derive investment research information from a variety of sources both external and internal our analysts visit these companies regularly contact managements frequently talk to competitors customers and suppliers and draw upon other diverse sources of information while one analyst has the primary responsibility for each company generally four to six companies per analyst information is also gathered by other analysts and is shared among all investment professionals because we consider ourself a longterm investor the investment professionals prepare detailed fiveyear projections for all investment prospects and investments these forecasts and the related appraisal of fair current value for each company under review are used to determine what we believe to be the intrinsic value of that company and are a critical tool in developing a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of a companys business this appraisal technique systematically examines numerous factors such as the companys growth prospects business and product line strength management capabilities financial resources and many others the purpose of this appraisal technique is to evaluate the investment potential and to assess the related risk of companies under review our goal is to construct portfolios of great businesses rather than portfolios of stocks as a result we consider each clients portfolio to be a quasiholding company the purpose of our thorough investment appraisal process is to concentrate our clients investments only in those businesses that appear to offer the greatest longterm appreciation potential the fiveyear forecasts and the appraisals for companies under review are refined frequently as our investment professionals update their research this consistent coverage allows our investment professionals to act decisively when changes in price and circumstances occur at any given time few businesses meet our standards accordingly our worldwide investment universe has historically been limited to fewer than  investment candidates from each of the united states europe japan and asiaexjapan which are selected based upon a consensus of our investment team this has allowed us to concentrate our clients investments in a portfolio typically of  companies that appear to offer the greatest longterm appreciation potential the businesses in which we invest normally increase profits every year these businesses normally achieve cumulative earnings growth at a rate we expect will approximately double earning power behind a clients portfolio every five years we believe that this pattern of consistent fairly rapid earnings growth has been the primary driver behind the improving value of our clients portfolios and the growth of our business over the years using thorough analysis and intensive research we select investment candidates based in part on the following criteria  a proven track record of consistent profit growth  strong financial condition  predictable earnings growth that we believe will continue for the next five years and beyond  accurate and reliable information that is readily available  successful experienced management that is accessible to our investment team  strong product lines and competitive position preferably with worldwide presence  lack of cyclicality and  large market capitalization and significant trading liquidity the determination of whether a particular investment prospect is eligible for inclusion in our investment universe is the result of a collective debatedriven process that actively involves all members of our investment team and reflects their collective research and analytical judgment and experience while the entire investment team contributes to the research and appraisal process each member has the freedom and responsibility to make investment decisions with respect to specific client accounts within the confines of the defined universe business strategy our business strategy is to continue to provide premier equity investment management services on a worldwide basis we believe that our pursuit of a more global clientele will lead to continued growth in our assets under management and our revenues and that both new and existing clients will benefit from our increased focus on international research and stock selection we intend to adhere to the distinctive and disciplined investment philosophy which we have pursued over our year history in addition we believe that a culture of ownership and compensation for performance will be a key element for our continued growth and future success and aligns the interests of our clients employees and stockholders extend investment performance central to our strategy is our objective to achieve aboveaverage investment returns over a long period of time for our clients while accepting what we believe to be belowaverage risk we intend to adhere in expanding and contracting markets alike without regard to benchmarks to a philosophy that emphasizes investment over a relatively longterm horizon in what we believe are high quality steadilygrowing businesses we intend to remain focused on investment performance while using our network of symbiotic marketers as the primary means to gather assets increase global research focus we want our clients to own equity in the finest growing businesses in the world we believe that having a global integrated research capability is a critical element in providing the best investment product we also believe that the introduction of the euro in the european monetary union will lead to an improvement in the quality and availability of financial information and a more consistent basis for comparing european companies with competitors inside and outside their home countries as the universe of high quality companies expands globally we intend to maintain a research effort parallel with the growing investment opportunities this global research capability will also allow us to meet particular client needs to the extent that they express any regional or national preferences the establishment of wp stewart  co europe ltd and the increase in our ownership in bowen asia limited a british virgin islands company operating in hong kong have enabled us to expand our nonus research capability pursue global clientele we believe that our services and performance have been wellreceived by clients throughout the world and that there exists significant opportunity to expand our clientele internationally especially in europe we believe that nonus investors are generally underinvested in equity securities and will look to established professionals like the stewart group to invest their wealth the introduction of the euro will minimize currency risk within europe and should reduce the resulting tendency of europebased investors to consider domicile an important factor in equity investing as part of our strategy to exploit this opportunity our acquisition of ns money management ltd and our establishment of wp stewart  co europe ltd have increased our access to a broader europebased clientele and provide us with a europebased investment management team which we expect to expand over the next five years also we have established and expanded our relationships with our symbiotic marketers including tpr  partners nv tpr curacao nv first long island investors llc and the notz stucki group of companies who are shareholders of the stewart group we expect that tpr  partners nv tpr curacao nv the notz stucki group of companies and first long island investors llc will continue to introduce new clients to us investment management team our highly experienced and motivated team of investment professionals has been critical to our strong longterm investment performance we have  senior investment professionals and  associate portfolio managers who directly participate in the investment process the following table

intention to leave the stewart group on amicable terms to pursue other interests following their departures and after the offerings these two managers will continue to own directly and indirectly an aggregate of approximately  of our shares the former portfolio managers who will continue to be our employees until november   are restricted by the terms of their employment agreements from prior to december   engaging in business with our clients or encouraging or soliciting any of our employees to resign or become affiliated with a competitor in which the former portfolio manager has an interest the two former portfolio managers are assisting us to ensure that their exit and the transition of the accounts for which they were responsible to other portfolio managers within our firm are accomplished in a manner which minimizes any disruption to our clients and our business while these two former portfolio managers were responsible for servicing a significant number of accounts as all of our portfolio managers share a common commitment to the stewart groups investment philosophy and methodology we do not believe that these events will result in a material change in assets under management although there can be no assurance that the current departures will not result in the closure of client accounts we are handling these departures and the associated account transitions in a manner which is substantially similar to the departures of previous portfolio managers who also were responsible for servicing a significant number of accounts which departures did not result in a material loss of client accounts historical performance record january  october   performance we have achieved a  compound annual return before fees and a  compound annual return after fees for the period from january   through september   this compares to a  return of the sp  index over the same period computed on a comparable basis our compound annualized returns for the five and ten years

performance of all client equity accounts having at least  million in market value as of january  of each year for which wp stewart  co ltd including its us predecessor company and wp stewart asset

believed by management to be representative of all fully discretionary client equity accounts if the criteria for account inclusion since  had been applied for periods prior to  there is no assurance that the results would be consistent although we believe the results would not be materially different the accounts included for the period from january   through september   are referred to as the composite or the managed accounts in the case of one portfolio manager who joined the stewart group as of  the performance data includes the performance of portfolios managed by him at a different firm during the period  through  using an investment philosophy similar to that practiced by us at the time the effect of this inclusion is to increase the compound annual return since inception by approximately onetenth of one percentage point the managed accounts exclude one portfolio managers  performance data in compliance with certain advisers act requirements the performance return excluding this data is substantially the same as the performance return would have been if such data had been included performance calculation beginning in  performance figures for the managed

weighting regardless of market value beginning in  account performance has been assetweighted based on the beginning of year market value of all accounts in the composite the prefee performance of our accounts for all years shown on the chart reflects the deduction of brokerage commissions but not the deduction of advisory fees which would reduce the overall return the postfee performance of our accounts for all years shown reflects the deduction of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees effect of advisory fees after  the postfee performance of our accounts reflects the deduction of the actual advisory fees charged each account in the composite adjusted for the effect of capital additions and withdrawals for the period  through  we have used the actual fee rates or the highest fee rates then prevailing from  through  advisory fees were deducted from performance at the end of each year if fees had been deducted from performance on a quarterly basis when charged the return since inception would have been decreased by approximately onetenth of one percentage point sp  the sp  index annual change shown in the chart relating to our  through september   performance includes the reinvestment of dividend income using a methodology similar to that used for our accounts it does not reflect the deduction of any transaction or custodial costs that would be involved in
