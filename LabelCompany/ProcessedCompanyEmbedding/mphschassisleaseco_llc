swaps story my truck life background i was raised as a poor farm kid on a small farm in western minnesota my dad had a talent to make almost anything from scrap pieces i guess i inherited some of that as well the first vehicle i drove was our  chevy  ton pickup when i was  years old i took a liking to the er as we called it i convinced my mom to buy a quart of dutchboy delft blue enamel so i could give the faded and beatup pickup a new look of course a quart didnt cover the whole pickup so i found some old dark blue paint to do the top i told you we were poor one coat of carefully brushapplied enamel goes along way the pickup had an overhauled   banger that ran like a top at  mph it was wound tight career background i always was a car nut so in my teen years i worked at a gas station and a body shop it was my dream to go to trade school for auto body and build street machines it was a 7s term i ended up going for drafting and machine design but took auto body as a night course i got my first career job while attending school i started out as a draftsman then tool draftsman then tool designer then production engineer assistant and then mechanical design engineer and after  years of dedication i was permanently laid off due to company downsizing birth of ez chassis swaps llc i took advantage of the severance period to design and develop a kit for 7 pickups i got the brainstorm four years prior to this when we were mounting my buddys  chevy on a shortwheel base s chassis i found out just how snakey those frames are and it was no easy task to make simple mounts to adapt the old body i figured i could save people a lot of time and frustration if i could develop a handy kit that also adapted as much of the s components as possible this would also save time  money because

line to meet the needs of our customers  by using local small manufacturing shops we add to the local economy built in the usa personal on the homepage i have the verse from proverbs  commit your work onto the lord and it will succeed i am convinced that god has encouraged me to take a huge step of faith and start this company without his encouragement i would have given up many times by now i
