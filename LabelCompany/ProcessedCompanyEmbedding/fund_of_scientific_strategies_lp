bond has passed its attachment point with an impact of more than  million at the end of november it was reported the attachment point for the  million cat bond  the stage at which qualifying losses start to erode investors principal  was set at  million so if the losses are confirmed investors would face a loss of at least  million of the principal on the deal specialist online magazine artemis said that qualifying losses from severe thunderstorm peril which includes tornado hail and straight line winds from convective weather rose throughout last year which took the reported estimate of qualifying ultimate net losses dangerously close to the attachment point artemis added that sources had said that the loss tally for gator re a special purpose vehicle set up by floridabased american strategic insurance had risen during last november but the artemis report no events had occurred in december that could add to the losses the loss reports are initial estimates and subject calculation agent assessment and revision if needed most of the increase in the loss tally is said to be from events earlier this year with around  million from events in november the report added however the fact that these reports show the deal has been triggered by such an amount would seem to suggest that investors must ready themselves for some erosion of capital and that not all of the principal will be returned at the end of the deals term which is the end of  and it said that as it was the aggregate section b coverage that faced losses only the amount that losses extend above the attachment point would be lost but artemis warned that other events in december could add result in further qualifying losses to the bond so the final estimated loss report at the end of the coverage period could be higher a partial repayment is set to be the end result for gator re and the cat bond was set to face an extension event at the end of last year where the losses would be firmed up and reported back to investors but artemis cautioned that loss estimates could go down as well as up so any loss of principal could fall as well as rise the gator re cat bond was set up in  and was expected to run for around two years and nine months to the end of last year the bond was marketed with an initial size of  million later increased to  million         gazelle fund

group  bermudabased financial services company  september  this and other gerova companies still listed on bermuda register of companies despite comments below  september  the men behind this bermudaregistered financialservices firm have been charged by regulators in connection with an alleged  million fraud in the us the securities and exchange commission sec claims six men involved with the gerova financial group formerly based in cumberland house victoria street hamilton hatched a plot to dump millions of the companys shares in an unregistered offering and distribution the sec alleges that jason galanis enlisted his father john galanis his two brothers jared and derek a family friend from the republic of kosovo and a gerova director gary hirst and gavin hamels an american investment adviser to carry out the  scheme an sec filing with the united states district court northern district of new york said eventually gerovas share price tumbled in reaction to the massive selloff engineered by jason galanis to stem the price decline jason galanis orchestrated a second phase of the scheme to artificially stabilize gerovas stock price he bribed two investment advisers to buy gerova shares in their respective clients accounts in order to create demand for the stock all told jason galanis scheme reaped him and his family members over  million all at the expense of unwitting investors the court was also told that jason galanis  who lives in los angeles california had also been banned in a previous case from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years to run from  to  and ordered to pay  in civil penalties but the filing with the us court that jason galanis was instrumental in the formation and development of gerova and in  advised members of a wealthy family from macau china on potential investments he later introduced a member of the family to a gibraltarbased fund the gibraltar fund controlled by one of his business associates to discuss the setup of a special purpose acquisition vehicle spac to focus on acquisitions based in asia the gibraltar fund and the macau family agreed to set up asia special situation acquisition corporation assac which was formed as a spac in the cayman islands in march  jason galanis was paid a  fee for his part in the deal and also entered into a consulting agreement with the gibraltar fund which entitled him to  per cent of the profits the gibraltar fund made from the spac assac changed its name to gerova financial group in january  the sec filing to the court said far beyond the terms of his consulting agreement with the gibraltar fund jason galanis substantially influenced the management operation and business direction of gerova from its inception he regularly attended gerova board meetings and had preexisting business relationships with members of the board he consulted management company counsel and the board on senior management hiring and firing decisions he reviewed draft commission filings and consulted gerovas officers directors and company counsel concerning disclosures made therein he interacted with gerovas public relations firms concerning the content of gerovas press releases and gave orders to gerovas counsel and management concerning actions to be taken with respect to its securities the sec filing said that jason galanis mindful of the officer and director bar imposed on him  made sure that his official capacity at the company was limited holding himself out as investment banker or adviser to the company but the filing added however in october  he became ceo of a gerova subsidiary gerova advisors llc in order to formalize his relationship with the company in that capacity jason galanis was to receive success fees upon the consummation of material financings or acquisitions by gerova that were introduced or consulted on by gerova advisors the sec also alleges that jason galanis senior role in gerova as well as his close relationships with senior officers and board members or his substantial holdings of gerova stock through several shell companies gerova companies remain listed on the bermuda register of companies but a spokesman for the bermuda monetary authority which regulates the financial services industry said there are currently no bermuda monetary authoritylicensed entities related to this matter the royal gazette reported in  that the firm had sought us bankruptcy court protection listing debts of as much as  million the company formerly known as asia special

bermuda mailbox was  per cent greater than in  according to filings the company made with the dutch chamber of commerce on december  and which were made available online on tuesday news of the filings was first reported by the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad alphabet moves the bulk of its nonus profits through this dutch subsidiary which has no employees the company has used the netherlands company since  as part of a tax structure dubbed a double irish and a dutch sandwich by moving most of its international profits to bermuda the company was able to reduce its effective tax rate outside the us to  per cent in  according to alphabets filings with the securities and exchange commission google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate a google spokesman said in a statement in february google also said such calculations of an effective tax rate do not reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes in any jurisdiction some  billion euros of the money funneled through the dutch company in  came from google ireland limited which collects most of googles international advertising revenues the rest came from a google subsidiary in singapore that serves a similar role the dutch company then transfers this money on to google ireland holdings unlimited which has the right to license googles intellectual property outside the us that company is based in bermuda which has no corporate income tax the use of the two irish entities is what gives the structure its double irish moniker the total amount of profit google had sheltered from us taxation most of which passes through its dutch subsidiary en route to bermuda grew to  billion in  according to alphabets sec filings the irish government closed the tax loophole that permitted double irish tax arrangements in  companies already using the structure however are allowed to continue employing it until the end of  google is under pressure from

 in a front page story in the uks daily telegraph newspaper it was revealed that the church of englands pension fund has a ł sterling  million stake in google plus significant other investments in a number of internet service providers earlier british prime minister david cameron had severely criticized google and others for uk tax avoidance on december   the royal gazette in bermuda quoted a bloomberg new york report that google avoided about  billion in worldwide income taxes in  by shifting  billion in revenues into a bermuda shell company almost double the total from three years before filings show by legally funneling profits from overseas subsidiaries into bermuda which doesnt have a corporate income tax google cut its overall tax rate almost in half the amount moved to bermuda is equivalent to about  percent of googles total pretax profit in  the increase in googles revenues routed to bermuda disclosed in a november  filing by a subsidiary in the netherlands could fuel the outrage spreading across europe and in the us over corporate tax dodging governments in france the uk italy and australia are probing googles tax avoidance as they seek to boost revenue during economic doldrums the european unions executive body the european commission has advised member states to create blacklists of tax havens and adopt antiabuse rules tax evasion and avoidance which cost the eu one trillion euros  trillion a year are scandalous and an attack on the fundamental principle of fairness algirdas semeta the ecs commissioner for taxation said at a press conference in brussels the tax strategy of google and other multinationals is a deep embarrassment to governments around europe said richard murphy an accountant and director of tax research llp in norfolk england the political awareness now being created in the uk and to a lesser degree elsewhere in europe is its us or them people understand that if google doesnt pay somebody else has to pay or services get cut google said it complies with all tax rules and its investment in various european countries helps their economies in the uk we also employ over  people help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online and invest millions supporting new tech businesses in east london the mountain view californiabased company said in a statement the internet search giant has avoided billions of dollars in income taxes around the world using a pair of tax shelter strategies known as the double irish and dutch sandwich bloomberg news reported in  the tactics permitted under tax law in the us and elsewhere move royalty payments from subsidiaries in ireland and the netherlands to a bermuda unit headquartered in a local law firm in  google reported a tax rate of just  percent on

uk members of parliament pressed executives from google seattlebased amazoncom inc and starbucks to explain why they dont pay more taxes there the uk googles secondbiggest market was responsible for about  percent of its sales or almost  billion last year according to company filings google paid  million  million in uk income taxes matt brittin googles vicepresident for northern and central europe testified that the company pays taxes where it creates economic value primarily the us still google attributes some profit based on technology created in the us to offshore subsidiaries lowering its us taxes according to company filings and people familiar with its tax planning google paid  billion in income taxes worldwide in  in the wake of the parliamentary hearing the house of commons issued a report in december  declaring that multinationals do not pay their fair share of tax the committee also criticised the uks tax collection agency her majestys revenue  customs for not taking sufficiently aggressive action and called on the agency to get a grip on corporate tax avoidance a spokesman for hmrc said the agency ensures that multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with uk tax law the french tax authority in  proposed increasing googles income taxes by about  billion the agency searched googles paris offices in june  and removed computer files as part of an examination first reported by bloomberg last year google is cooperating with french authorities and works with them to answer all their questions on google france and our service the company said in italy the tax police began an audit of google in november  and recently searched the companys milan offices as well as the offices of facebook according to a person familiar with the matter its very common for companies to be audited and we have been working closely with the italian authorities for some time google said so far we have not had any demands for additional tax in italy facebook based in menlo park california is cooperating with the italian tax authority and we take our obligations under the italian tax code very seriously a company spokeswoman said in googles case an irish subsidiary collects revenues from ads sold in countries like the uk and france that irish unit in turn pays royalties to another irish subsidiary whose legal residence for tax purposes is in bermuda the pair of irish units gives rise to the nickname double irish to avoid an irish withholding tax google channeled the payments to bermuda through a subsidiary in the netherlands  thus the dutch sandwich label the netherlands subsidiary has no employees the dutch units payments to the bermuda entity in  were up  percent to  billion from  billion in  googles

trusts on the island winston wong the son of formosa plastics groups late founder wang yungching has sued an adviser for transferring the bulk of the family fortune valued at  billion into bermuda trusts controlled by other family members dr winston wong eldest son of yc yang said in a statement yesterday the bermuda court now has an opportunity to recognize and resolve the injustice that has been perpetrated on my father on his heirs the shareholders of fpg and on the people and government of taiwan we trust that justice and truth will prevail it was pointed out in the statement that taiwan stood to receive billions in taxes which could help get rid of its deficit additionally if the bermuda court declares the transfer of assets to the trusts invalid and turns the assets over to yc wangs estate the taiwanese government could receive an estimated nt  billion to nt  billion in various taxes us  billion to us  billion  which could eliminate the governments anticipated  budget deficit of nt  billion us billion the statement said hung wen hsiung set up the trusts excluding wang referred to in court documents as yc wang from the ownership and some members of his direct family as beneficiaries according to a statement of claim filed by wong yesterday in the supreme court of bermuda bermuda is the fourth jurisdiction where wong filed claims to recover the estate of his father which he said is valued at  billion bloomberg reported that hung wongs halfsisters susan wang and sandy wang as well as group chairman william wong and wilfred wang are among the trusts managers according to a copy of the court filing wang died in the us in  at the age of  he founded taiwans biggest diversified industrial company formosa plastics group which made pretax profit of nt billion  billion in  according to the companys website the group has worldwide assets valued at more than  billion and employs  people according to the lawsuit the case is between wong wenyoung and grand view private trust co in the supreme court of bermuda we are seeking to invalidate the transfers and get a declaration that the assets are held for all the heirs of yc wang mark stoutenburg wongs lawyer said in a phone interview frank fu a spokesman for the formosa plastics group declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached by phone by bloomberg yesterday in a statement put out dr winston wong eldest son of yc yang said  percent of his personal fortune was allegedly transferred without his consent the statement said the bermuda outcome could determine control of formosa plastics group and that the offshore trusts are the largest shareholders of four treasures the statement said dr wong conducted an extensive fouryear investigation that revealed the following key findings  that the trusts are noncharitable  that the trusts were established in secret by a minority of yc wangs family  that the assets were transferred into the trusts without his fathers consent and  the trust assets should have been declared as part of his late fathers estate dr wongs lawsuit focuses on the contention that the transfer of yc wangs assets into the trusts is invalid and he seeks to have these assets returned to their rightful owners yc wangs estate and legal heirs the lawsuit names as defendants the grand view private trust company ltd established in  transglobe private trust company ltd  vantura private trust company ltd  and universal link private trust company ltd  all of which are incorporated in bermuda mr hung wen hsiung the late yc wangs longtime personal financial advisor is also named as a defendant for his role in creating the trusts and transferring yc wangs assets to the trusts mr stoutenburg noted its impossible to believe that the late yc wang gave the required consent and approved the transfer of his immense fortune to these four trusts there is no evidence that mr wang knew that the transfer of these assets would permanently strip him of his ownership of them and give control of the assets to just a tiny minority of his large family the bermuda trusts together hold approximately  percent of yc wangs personal fortune given yc wangs famously meticulous attention to detail it is inconceivable that he would have approved transactions of such magnitude and importance without being involved in every step there is no evidence however that he ever saw read or signed any of the complex documents establishing the trusts  which were written in english a language neither he nor his advisor mr hung could speak or read the defendants and their agents do not deny these facts he continued this has led dr wong to the inevitable conclusion that his father was deceived stoutenburg explains the wang chang gung charitable trust established by yc wang and named in honor of dr wongs grandfather was the blueprint for mr wangs charitable giving he was very detailed and specific about its mission its management and its financing he included his entire family he did nothing in secret he left nothing to chance he made everything transparent the bermuda trusts established in secret with no clear charitable mission or activity stand in stark contrast to this and are trying to hide behind the good deeds of the wang chang gung charitable trust the purpose trusts were established offshore in bermuda to avoid scrutiny in taiwan and so that they could be hidden from yc wangs estate despite repeated requests no proof has been provided about the purported charitable activities of the trusts nor has dr wongs widespread investigation turned up any evidence that the bermuda trusts are engaged in any charitable activities in summary says stoutenburg the evidence indicates that the bermuda trusts were primarily established to  secretly ensure that the control of fpg was kept in the hands of a few family insiders and guarantee that other family members could not inherit significant shares upon yc wangs death  drastically reduce yc wangs estate  obscure the true ownership of fpg under the guise of foreign investors and  hold the assets of a vast global business empire controlled by a few members of the family all of this was done offshore to avoid the scrutiny of taiwan regulators the statement added dr wongs lawyers assert that the people who control the trusts have unchecked and unregulated power to do whatever they like with the billions of dollars of assets in the trusts there are no outside authorities or government bodies in bermuda that actively supervise the trusts or the billions of dollars worth of assets they control to the contrary these offshore purpose trusts named in dr wongs lawsuit are controlled and selfsupervised by the same people who benefit from the decisions they make the statement said going on to say the lawsuit which marks a critical point in dr wongs longstanding efforts to restore his late fathers legacy has profound implications for the future of fpg if the bermuda court rules that the transfer of yc wangs fpg stake to the offshore trusts should be undone it would affect the current management and control of fpg     granite management  richmond road

employees that he was not leaving because there were problems at hamilton  but because there were problems at aig he was confident he could help fix he said hamilton was founded on a bold idea whose time had come as other industries leapt ahead in their pursuit of value in data and technology insurance lagged behind it was only a matter of time before someone disrupted the industry hamiltons investors believed that with the right underwriting talent and with two sigmas data science prowess we could be the ones to do it and weve been proven right mr duperreault said hamilton had set up a nimble clientfocused company widely admired  and in many cases envied  by the markets in which we do business in the us we were the drivers behind the establishment of attune a groundbreaking platform for small commercial insurance in bermuda were redefining what it means to be a tier  company at lloyds we came to market with a full suite of product offerings faster than any other syndicate leveraging technology to strip out much of the inefficiency that plagues lloyds so i know that hamilton is in great shape some of the best minds in the business work here theres an energy thats palpable when you visit our offices if you ask me why im leaving its not because there are issues at hamilton im leaving because there are issues at aig and i think i can help fix them in no small part by unlocking the potential represented by the hamiltontwo sigmaaig partnership already in place at attune and mr duperreault said the move would be transformative for the group he founded nearly four years ago he explained as part of the expanded partnership with aig and tsiq hamilton will play a significant role in leading the datadriven evolution in underwriting thats what we had in mind when we launched this company just over three years ago mr duperreault added in closing i want you to know how proud i am of what weve done together i know the best is yet to come i look forward to the opportunities were going to have to work together and i thank each and every one of you for your commitment to hamiltons present and to its future  may  industry veteran brian

accepted brians resignation from hamilton he is an industry icon with a welldeserved reputation for visionary leadership we have had the privilege of experiencing this firsthand at hamilton mr duperreault  is a former lieutenant and protégé of exaig ceo maurice hank greenberg and is recognized for his experience in turning around struggling companies he will replace peter hancock as aig ceo who was almost three quarters through a plan designed to turn the ailing giant around after a series of poor results mr duperreault moved up through the ranks of aig early in his career leaving in  to build ace now chubb from a small operator into a global operation mr duperreault who was also ceo of hamilton will be replaced in that role by david brown the former ceo of flagstone re mr freda

risk in addition our relationship with two sigma our technology and investment partner has been an extremely productive one since hamiltons launch at the end of  our experience with attune the technologyenabled company established with two sigma and aig has demonstrated the huge potential in applying data science and analytics to transform the underwriting process we are all excited about the potential for ongoing growth and development at hamilton mr duperreault who founded insurance and reinsurance company hamilton four years ago after a long career in the sector had been touted as the new ceo of aig for some time aigs shares climbed  per cent yesterday to  after the news was announced mr duperreault took charge at marsh  mclennan companies in  and launched a successful

of the board at the bermuda stock exchange since   september  the insurance industry has to get leaner and make greater use of technology according to industry veteran brian duperreault mr duperreault chairman of hamilton insurance group said our delivery of our product is grossly overexpensed we are not doing our insureds any favors in how we deliver that service we take too much money out of the premium dollar to cover the cost of actually delivering the service as opposed to the service itself mr duperreault was speaking to am best tv at the rendezvous conference in monte carlo he added that his group had teamed up with insurance giants american international group and hamiltons existing partner two sigma to create a new insurance platform targeting small and mediumsized businesses in the us mr duperreault said aig suggested we look at the sme space together which i thought was a great idea the idea is to get away from everything that has been done and start afresh in this joint venture and create a company that is specially purposed specially built to do just this in the new way in a way where were using data science technology capabilities to really provide a better service to the insured which is ultimately what we do we enlisted the aid of two sigma who were and remain our technology partner and investment partner  they got very excited about doing this with aig we see it as a great way of exchanging information intellectual property developing new intellectual property and really making a difference in this area of business a lot of companies want to make a change i dont care who you talk to if you say what do you think about technology were interested were doing what we can but i think most companies are trapped in what they are the existing infrastructure the company thats been built over time theres tremendous value in that and its not easy to take that throw that out and try something completely different the real difference is we will start from nothing which is a great asset to have ive always said that you start from nothing and build it in a way that makes sense now with the digital world we are in if you look at our business and there is much to be proud of in what we do we provide a tremendous social service we protect individuals corporations countries but frankly it hasnt evolved in the same way other industries have evolved in this digital world mr duperreault said that blue marble microinsurance set up by hamilton insurance group aig aspen guy carpenter old mutual transre xl catlin and zurich to provide the developing world with insurance products could also help regenerate the mainstream industry a statement on a partner website said we share a vision of collaborating to develop insurance supply to benefit underserved communities worldwide blue marble will incubate the launch and operations of new solutions including unique distribution methods local partnerships and product development mr duperreault said that reverse engineering applied to traditional businesses using lessons learnt from blue marble could lead to greater efficiency he explained its being done in a different way  a virtual company using the resources of all the consortium members and he said this is a real effort to do real business create a forprofit approach create a market but really provide a service if you can solve the problems of micro you have got to deal with distribution you have got to deal with transactions electronically and digitally you have got to be able to handle claims and do other services all in a way thats enormously efficient because there isnt enough money to go around that knowledge if it doesnt do anything more than give you an insight into what youre doing in your existing business it probably will give you actual solutions to what youre doing in your existing business along these lines and were all trying to solve that  may  hamilton

hamilton insurance group and hamilton re joining the rush to expand through acquisition there are some attractive companies that could give hamilton insurance group a start with a new strategy or which have a different product range or operate in another region we would have to look at it some people are questioning the valuations of some merger and acquisition strategy but if shareholders

internationally traded business in the london market  generally large or complex business which needs to be shared with other insurers or needs the international licences of lloyds hiscox uk and hiscox europe offer a range of specialist insurance for professionals and business customers as well as high net worth individuals hiscox international includes operations in bermuda guernsey and usa one of the uks leading insurers of higher value homes and also one of the most expensive of mediumvalue homes hiscox also has bermudabased kiskadee insurancelinked strategies funds listed separately  february  hiscox made record profits in  helped by favorable foreigncurrency moves and increased earnings from its hamiltonbased reinsurance division the groups profits totaled ł million  million up  per cent on  the relative weakness of the pound helped the bermudian firm to net foreign exchange gains of ł million even with the flattering impact of the currency fluctuations robert childs chairman of hiscox said these were a cracking set of results return on equity was  per cent while the investment return was  per cent the company declared a final dividend of p bringing the fullyear dividend up to p a  per cent increase on  in an interview mr childs conceded that political developments around the world particularly brexit and the election of donald trump and a republicancontrolled congress in the us  had the potential to affect the business he said the borderadjustment tax proposed by president trump could  if it applied to reinsurance  have an impact not only on bermuda but on the industry no one knows yet what will happen yet  its just too early to say bermudas advantages as a reinsurance centre went further than tax he added citing solvency ii thirdcountry equivalency in particular as a major operator in the lloyds of london market hiscox is also grappling with the impact of britains impending departure from the european union and the likely loss of passporting rights that currently allow ukbased financialservices companies to do business throughout the eu we are looking to set up a new company in europe in either luxembourg or malta mr childs said that could happen within the next  months hiscox employs more than  people at its head office in wessex house on reid street where its reinsurance and insurancelinked securities division operates gross written premiums for hiscox re and ils increased by  per cent to ł million or  per cent when currency moves are stripped out driven by growth in casualty and specialty lines as well as business written on behalf of the alternative capital management unit kiskadee the division delivered a ł million profit and a combined ratio of  per cent mr childs said kiskadee founded in  had grown rapidly and now had assets under management of  billion putting it firmly in the premier league of ils businesses the hiscox london market business generated a ł million profit however margins are under pressure from rates driven down by a glut of capital according to mr childs and the soft market shows no signs of hardening asked what was needed to turn the market mr childs said i think its got to do with a combination of low margins followed by a shock loss when you look back to  the loss was only about  billion but it hit at a time when margins were very low the margins are getting very low now hiscoxs retail operations had a stellar year generating nearly half the groups total profit retail operations in the uk and europe doubled their profits while hiscox usa produced premium growth of  per cent bronek masojada hiscoxs chief executive officer said this is a good result flattered by foreign exchange and boosted by a strong investment return our retail business has come of age driving growth and profitability for the group this gives us options and although there are uncertainties in both the insurance and political environments we have the right people footprint and financial power to adapt we will remain focused and disciplined where margins are shrinking and invest where we see opportunities for longterm profitable growth   july  hiscox is ready to restructure in response to britains impending departure from the european union  but brexit is unlikely to do any harm to bermuda as an insurance and reinsurance jurisdiction that is view of robert childs chairman of hiscox who was speaking with the royal gazette after hiscox announced halfyear profits that rose  per cent to ł million some of the increase was down to the weakness of the uk pound after britons voted to leave the eu in a june  referendum in the interim earnings statement mr childs said hiscox was ready to set up a new european insurance company if necessary  for us brexit is a structural rather than a strategic issue mr childs said theresa may britains new prime minister says brexit will happen but no one knows what it will look like yet hiscox was preparing for either brexit light  a scenario in which the uk retained full access to the eu market and free movement of people and good continued  and for brexit heavy in which market access became limited by the loss of passporting rights that allow britishbased companies to trade without restriction in the eu as we said before the referendum we were in a corporate sense agnostic about the vote mr childs said we have a big european operation that generates  million worth of business were in spain france germany the benelux countries and germany so were already there so we could easily set up a new insurer in europe if we needed to we would probably look to decide by the first quarter of  in which country we would want to set up and it would take about  months to do that so about  months to it actually starting up speaking on the industrywide impact he said the reinsurance side of the lloyds market was the most likely to travel postbrexit as for the impact on bermuda he said it shows how important solvency ii equivalency was for the island bermuda now has an established relationship with eiopa the overseer of insurance in the eu and i cant see brexit as being a bad thing for bermuda the european commission earlier this year gave bermuda thirdcountry equivalence with solvency ii the country blocs new regulatory regime for the insurance industry which means bermudianbased insurers will be able to do business on a level playing field in the eu britain will have to apply for solvency ii equivalence and that will be interesting mr childs said hiscoxs pretax profit of ł million was up from ł million last year with londonlisted hiscox declaring its profits in pounds the dramatic weakening of the pound in the last week of the firsthalf period gave a massive boost to results given that much of hiscoxs profit was generated in us dollars and euros excluding the foreign exchange gain hiscoxs net income was ł million hiscoxs retail business was the largest contributor to profit while hiscox usa delivered the strongest growth of  per cent in local currency and hiscox london market grew by  per cent the group combined ratio  the proportion of premium dollars spent on claims and expenses  was  per cent or  per cent excluding the currency impact the reinsurance side of the business which is headquartered in bermuda managed a combined ratio of  per cent or  per cent excluding currency gains it generated profit of ł million on gross premiums written of ł million bermuda is also home to kiskadee investment managers the groups alternative capital management arm whose assets under management have risen to more than  billion an achievement described in a note by analysts at shore capital as a quite remarkable success story to date for many competitors the second quarter brought material catastrophe losses but hiscox estimated a relatively modest ł million loss something mr childs put down to excellent underwriting hiscox reported a very competitive market in most lines of business but mr childs said price reductions are getting smaller hiscox also raised its interim dividend by  per cent to p hiscox shares were down p in london stock exchange trading to p after the results were announced yesterday  may  the former chairman of bermudabased insurance giant hiscox said the firm could move back to london if the uk votes to quit the european union robert hiscox who chaired the firm for  years until  and is now honorary chairman told the uks press association the company had moved from london to bermuda a decade ago because of the british tax and regulatory regime under the thenlabour government and the eu mr hiscox said we dont want to bring it back while were in the eu if we leave then it depends on the domestic regime whether we come back or not but its possible he added however but we love being in bermuda its a useful place its close to the us where we do a lot of business and it makes us feel international its not just a tax dodge jeremy pinchin the ceo of hiscox bermuda and hiscox re yesterday distanced the company from mr hiscoxs statements on brexit  and reaffirmed the firms commitment to the island mr pinchin said robert is honorary president of hiscox while he is a major shareholder he is not on the board of hiscox the issue of leaving bermuda domicile whether britain leaves the eu or not is not on the board agenda and we remain committed to bermuda mr hiscox also launched an attack on david cameron the prime minister and his corrupt campaign to remain an eu member and accused the british treasury the finance arm of government which released a paper predicting a massive recession if britain voted to exit the eu of putting out illegal propaganda the part the government has played in this debate is astonishing their corrupt statements and illegal propaganda pouring out is something to behold especially the treasury document mr hiscoxs comments echoed those of former conservative chancellors of the exchequer the equivalent of finance minister nigel lawson and norman lamont who are now members of the house of lords and part of a major split in their party over the eu mr hiscox added that major city of london institutions that had come out in favour of continued membership of the eu were an elite motivated by their own interests he said all the experts coming out for remain are all part of the elite from goldman sachs downwards theyve all bought into it its in their own selfinterest im astonished when i meet people from remain ill never understand why they want in a global race to tie the uk to  other countries some of which have no legs why do we want to have millions of rules delivered by an unelected tyrannical elite in brussels mr hiscox was one of  business leaders to sign an open letter calling for the uk to leave the eu mr hiscox now runs a bookshop in marlborough in the english county of wiltshire  march  bermudian insurer hiscox ltd which advertises itself in the uk as a reputable insurer wrote more business last year but profits fell  per cent mainly due to dwindling investment returns hiscox said fullyear profit fell to ł million from ł million in  slightly better than analysts had expected gross written premiums climbed  per cent to ł billion  billion in  and the groups retail businesses contributed  per cent of income the groups investment return was ł million or  per cent down from ł million or  per cent in  the year had been characterised by low yields and volatility in many asset classes hiscox said hiscox re the reinsurance part of the business which operates out of the groups head office at wessex house on reid street hamilton achieved growth of  per cent ł million compared to ł million in  in local currency growth was calculated at  per cent hiscox re recorded strong profitability with a combined ratio  reflecting the proportion of premium dollars spent on claims and expenses  of  per cent bettering s  per cent the company put the growth down to a focus on product innovation which generated an extra  million of premium the benign claims environment continues to put pressure on rates hiscox stated last years important  renewals saw rates fall by  per cent and this year they fell again by  per cent inside two years hiscox said its hamiltonbased ilsfocused kiskadee arm had grown to be a significant brand in the market and was on track to reach  billion in assets under management this year last year hiscox also launched cardinal re ltd a special purpose insurer domiciled in bermuda designed to transform collateralised insurance and reinsurance risk into a security more suited for capital market investors hiscox declared a second interim dividend of p per share which included a special dividend of p however the company warned investors that in future it intended to retain more capital to focus on pursuing opportunities for profitable growth bronek masojada hiscoxs chief executive officer said the firm like its competitors had benefited from the absence of major natural catastrophes he added in his outlook for this year our biggerticket businesses are more likely to retreat with growth coming from our new teams in specialty retail across the world hiscox  hiscox

game of pass the parcel ironshore inc switched hands this week for the second time in two years but it is all good according to mitch blaser chief executive officer of ironshore bermuda it is fantastic news for ironshore overall he said a day after it was announced that liberty mutual insurances  billion acquisition of ironshore has been completed the fact that liberty mutual has confidence in our brand and our operations to integrate their us operations into ours  that was a very strong vote of confidence in the strength of our brand and our business model said mr mitch he was referring to liberty mutuals decision to combine its existing liberty international underwriters us business and ironshores us specialty lines business under the ironshore brand clearly the retention of the ironshore brand is another favorable aspect to our operations in the us bermuda and internationally he is not alone in his positive outlook for ironshore under liberty mutuals ownership ratings services have also weighed in on tuesday am best removed ironshore from under review and affirmed its a rating while moodys lifted a number of its ratings of ironshore segments to a two years ago ironshore was bought by shanghaibased fosun international the global investment group then opted to sell the insurer last december to liberty mutual as it offloaded assets to enhance its financial flexibility when asked if another change of ownership in such a short period of time was unsettling mr blaser said weve been very fortunate because fosun was a fantastic owner they bought us with the idea to build the franchise and have us run as an independent entity so the impact on our people was minimal postacquisition now we have been fortunate again to have a company with the breadth and depth of liberty mutual buy us with the intention of keeping the brand intact and building on our franchise from a business standpoint and an underwriting standpoint weve been very fortunate and the disruption as a result has been minimal our people are very enthusiastic about this latest change in ownership and very motivated to grow the company ironshore which has offices in  countries was formed in  in the wake of the catastrophic losses caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in bermuda it has offices on front street there have been no announced changes to the companys operations on the island as a result of the acquisition mr blaser sees opportunities to strengthen ironshores operations in bermuda and globally it provides us with the platform with a very strong parent company and balance sheet to continue to expand our operations and build out the specialty businesses of ironshore as part of liberty mutual which will bode well for our bermuda operations he said ironshore bermuda will see opportunities to crosssell to liberty mutuals client base mr blaser who is also coo of ironshore inc added in addition as of today we are globally a us company with so many of our clients and clientbase emanating out of the us from a bermuda standpoint the closure of this deal provides for a growth platform in terms of the strength of our balance sheet the strength of our ratings access to the client base of liberty mutual and the strength of the resources that liberty mutual brings to ironshore bermuda and the rest of ironshore the combination of ironshore and liberty mutual has created a global specialty business with about  billion in net written premiums when asked if he thought mergers and acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance sector would continue with companies morphing into larger entities mr blaser said yes it will continue i dont know if this is the beginning or the middle its certainly not the end its very difficult for businesses in our industry to survive without the scale of resources and a strong balance sheet behind them this type of consolidation has been evident in the reinsurance space probably for over five years now you are seeing it in the insurance space as well he said that when capacity is widely available and it becomes difficult for a company to differentiate itself from competitors then having a strong financial rating and balance sheet are increasingly important factors for clients and brokers deciding where to place business those advantages and those resources help differentiate yourself with the customer and are the most important features today that will force more consolidation ironshore is the official insurer of americas cup defender oracle team usa looking ahead to the competition which starts at the end of this month mr blaser said we are very much plugged into and excited about the potential of the americas cup for bermuda not only as a sponsor but to support it in any way possible  december  the chinese owner of ironshore has agreed to sell the bermudianbased insurer to us giant liberty mutual in a  billion deal the us company which struck the deal with shanghaibased fosun international said it planned to let ironshore operate with the same management team and brand but as part of the larger liberty mutual organisation which has a focus on growing its specialty lines operations and mitch blaser ceo of the bermuda arm of ironshore said the move could mean an expansion and more jobs for the island operation mr blaser said if anything from a business perspective we would expect to see the opportunity to expand taking advantage of the liberty mutual resources global client base and infrastructure he added liberty mutual does not have a bermuda operation so ironshore will become the liberty mutual and ironshore bermuda operation mr blaser said the nuts and bolts of the deal had still to be negotiated so any changes could not be expected in the short term but he added our goal is to grow our bermuda business  thats a joint goal for ironshore and liberty mutual mr blaser said we see this as a big positive for our global business and we also believe its a very big positive for bermuda when you are a bermuda company you are very restricted in being able to do business in other jurisdictions when you are a us company you have freedom to do business in the united states because you are paying taxes in the united states david long liberty mutual chairman and chief executive officer said we are pleased to have ironshore and its proven management team led by ceo kevin kelley join liberty mutual ironshore has a track record of profitably underwriting global and diverse specialty risks insurance and is an ideal complement to liberty mutual providing additional scale expertise innovation and market relationships to our  billion global specialty business kevin kelley ironshore ceo added the combination of ironshore and liberty mutual is a winwin proposition and value creating for both companies ironshore will become part of a another arated company with a global reach a strong balance sheet wide client base and a much greater capacity to drive profitable growth and he said the deal was beneficial for all three parties involved and is the culmination of a careful and

return whilst serving the needs of our clients and their brokers these results prove that even in the current difficult times we have relevance our model works and is resilient at  january in line with our expectations and previous communication we successfully renewed our core book across the group including at our lloyds platform he said the company had been rebuilding and reinvigorating its lloyds platform looking ahead he said whilst we expect market conditions to remain difficult for the foreseeable future which requires discipline and patience to navigate our strategy has the ability to respond across the insurance cycle we are well equipped to meet the needs of our clients and to generate acceptable returns for investors whilst having the flexibility to capitalize quickly on new opportunities as they arise lancashires operating earnings per diluted share was  cents for the fourthquarter which was flat compared to the same period in  for the full year it was  cents down from  cents in  the companys ceded reinsurance premiums increased by  million or  per cent during the year as lancashire and its lloyds member cathedral underwriting bought more reinsurance limit they added new layers attaching at lower loss levels for around the same outlay according to the company report elaine whelan group chief financial officer said our outlook for  is for a continuation of current market trends at  january we have once again been able to further reduce our exposure levels with additional reinsurance purchases and our risk levels are lower now than at any other point in our history we are therefore carrying a bit more of a capital buffer than we typically would which gives us the ability to take advantage of any opportunities that may materialize this year within the lancashire group are bermudabased lancashire insurance company and kinesis capital management together with lancashire insurance company uk and cathedral underwriting ltd  november  insurer and reinsurer bermudabased lancashire yesterday posted pretax profits of  million the figure is  million up on the same period last year gross premiums written dropped  million to  million quarter on quarter between last year and this and earnings per share rose four cents to  per diluted share in the third quarter alex maloney group ceo said the groups results for the third quarter have once again been strong our return on equity of  per cent for the quarter and  per cent for the year to date demonstrate our ability to deliver excellent results throughout the insurance cycle and during challenging market conditions these results are a tribute to the quality of our people throughout the group and an illustration of the fruits of disciplined underwriting and prudent risk selection mr maloney added that hurricane matthew which devastated parts of the caribbean particularly haiti before striking florida georgia and the carolinas fell outside the financial reporting period but he said however as an insured event affecting the us the level of insured damage was less than it might have been in other circumstances matthew is an attritional loss for the insurance sector as a whole certainly not of a size to constitute the marketmoving event which sooner or later will occur however it is a timely reminder of the volatility and unpredictability of loss events in our industry and will contribute to the further erosion of margins and profitability across the sector elaine whelan lancashire chief financial officer added our outlook for  is a continuation of current market trends however we expect to be able to maintain our core book and consequently operate at a similar capital level to this year we are therefore returning approximately  million of capital via a special dividend that represents  million of comprehensive income for the year to date we have now returned  billion or  per cent of total comprehensive income since inception  july  lancashire holdings made aftertax profits of  million for the second quarter of the year  down  million on the same quarter last year gross premiums written for the period totaled  million an increase of  million on the  million recorded for the second quarter of  alex maloney group chief executive officer of the bermudiandomiciled company with its head office in london said our return on equity of  per cent for the second quarter and  per cent for the halfyear represent an excellent result achieved during challenging times i have previously talked about our commitment to maintain a strong core book of business serving the needs of our valued clients and their brokers whilst also bringing down overall risk levels in line with our view of the underwriting opportunities these results are clear evidence that our stated model is working diluted earnings per share totaled  cents for the quarter compared to  cents for the second quarter of  while total investment return was  per cent mr maloney said at a time when premium rates and insurance policy terms and conditions are under pressure our model has helped not only to deliver the underwriting service which is expected of us but also to insulate our balance sheet against a string of small to mediumsized natural catastrophe and specialty market losses we are starting to see evidence of the insurance industry sustaining a series of net losses during the first half of  against this background it is reassuring to note that lancashires reinsurance purchasing strategy has enabled the group to reduce our net liabilities by about  million when compared to the reinsurance programme purchased in  on the investment side the return of  per cent for the quarter is a strong return proving our strategy remains appropriate for our business our conservative approach to our investments allows us to maintain our focus on the fundamentals of good underwriting and risk management total investment return including net investment income net other investment income net realized gains and losses impairments and net changes in unrealized gains and losses was a gain of  million for the second quarter compared to a lost of  million for the same period in   may  lancashire holdings saw its profit almost halved to  million in the first quarter however the company kept its combined ratio steady at  per cent only a fraction higher than the same period last year price reductions on renewals in january and april were evident in all classes but particularly the energy sector where renewal prices were  per cent of those achieved in the first three months of  elaine whelan the groups chief financial officer said the price reductions were broadly in line with our expectations on both the inwards and the outwards books she added although the market continues to be challenging we remain well able to maintain our core portfolio however absent a marketchanging event there is no reason to believe pricing will improve in the near term and it is therefore more likely that well return capital than retain it later in the year lancashire holdingss gross premiums written were  million for the quarter down from  million the groups profit after tax dipped  million while its net operating profit dropped to  million from  million alex maloney chief executive officer referred to the groups return on equity of  per cent as strong he added i am pleased that we have managed to defend our core book of business with premium income at a similar level to a year ago in what remains a very tough underwriting environment brokers are looking for quality of service and security and are increasingly tiering the insurance market on that basis whether in bermuda london or at lloyds our group platforms are valued for their ability to provide excellent client service in those lines in which we specialize and we are fortunately seeing opportunities not only to maintain but also to build our participation on some of our core books of business this has helped insulate our business from some of the chillier blasts faced by the smaller following markets lancashires total

prize in a game of pass the parcel ironshore inc switched hands this week for the second time in two years but it is all good according to mitch blaser chief executive officer of ironshore bermuda it is fantastic news for ironshore overall he said a day after it was announced that liberty mutual insurances  billion acquisition of ironshore has been completed the fact that liberty mutual has confidence in our brand and our operations to integrate their us operations into ours  that was a very strong vote of confidence in the strength of our brand and our business model said mr mitch he was referring to liberty mutuals decision to combine its existing liberty international underwriters us business and ironshores us specialty lines business under the ironshore brand clearly the retention of the ironshore brand is another favorable aspect to our operations in the us bermuda and internationally he is not alone in his positive outlook for ironshore under liberty mutuals ownership ratings services have also weighed in on tuesday am best removed ironshore from under review and affirmed its a rating while moodys lifted a number of its ratings of ironshore segments to a two years ago ironshore was bought by shanghaibased fosun international the global investment group then opted to sell the insurer last december to liberty mutual as it offloaded assets to enhance its financial flexibility when asked if another change of ownership in such a short period of time was unsettling mr blaser said weve been very fortunate because fosun was a fantastic owner they bought us with the idea to build the franchise and have us run as an independent entity so the impact on our people was minimal postacquisition now we have been fortunate again to have a company with the breadth and depth of liberty mutual buy us with the intention of keeping the brand intact and building on our franchise from a business standpoint and an underwriting standpoint weve been very fortunate and the disruption as a result has been minimal our people are very enthusiastic about this latest change in ownership and very motivated to grow the company ironshore which has offices in  countries was formed in  in the wake of the catastrophic losses caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in bermuda it has offices on front street there have been no announced changes to the companys operations on the island as a result of the acquisition mr blaser sees opportunities to strengthen ironshores operations in bermuda and globally it provides us with the platform with a very strong parent company and balance sheet to continue to expand our operations and build out the specialty businesses of ironshore as part of liberty mutual which will bode well for our bermuda operations he said ironshore bermuda will see opportunities to crosssell to liberty mutuals client base mr blaser who is also coo of ironshore inc added in addition as of today we are globally a us company with so many of our clients and clientbase emanating out of the us from a bermuda standpoint the closure of this deal provides for a growth platform in terms of the strength of our balance sheet the strength of our ratings access to the client base of liberty mutual and the strength of the resources that liberty mutual brings to ironshore bermuda and the rest of ironshore the combination of ironshore and liberty mutual has created a global specialty business with about  billion in net written premiums when asked if he thought mergers and acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance sector would continue with companies morphing into larger entities mr blaser said yes it will continue i dont know if this is the beginning or the middle its certainly not the end its very difficult for businesses in our industry to survive without the scale of resources and a strong balance sheet behind them this type of consolidation has been evident in the reinsurance space probably for over five years now you are seeing it in the insurance space as well he said that when capacity is widely available and it becomes difficult for a company to differentiate itself from competitors then having a strong financial rating and balance sheet are increasingly important factors for clients and brokers deciding where to place business those advantages and those resources help differentiate yourself with the customer and are the most important features today that will force more consolidation ironshore is the official insurer of americas cup defender oracle team usa looking ahead to the competition which starts at the end of this month mr blaser said we are very much plugged into and excited about the potential of the americas cup for bermuda not only as a
