to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys

on the companys financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in
