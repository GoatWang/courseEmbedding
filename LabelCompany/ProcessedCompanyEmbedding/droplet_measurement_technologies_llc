lightscattering lightscattering is used to determine the size of smaller water droplets a laser illuminates the particle which scatters the light in all directions this light is measured and used along with mie theory to infer particle size polarization detection polarized light is used to determine particle phase a laser illuminates the particle polarized light measurements are recorded and ratios of polarized to nonpolarized light are used to infer phase polarization detection is available on certain probes including the cdp and bcpd supersaturation generation dmts nuclei counters work by generating supersaturated conditions rh   inside the instrument nuclei are drawn into the instrument and the supersaturation causes water vapor to condense around them the resulting particles are then counted by an optical particle counter giving an estimate of nuclei in the inflow fluorescence detection fluorescence detection is used to detect bioaerosols bioaerosols fluorescence whereas nonorganic aerosols do not measuring the amount of fluorescence emission thus provides an estimate of bioaerosol concentrations hotwire sensing dmts liquid water content sensor lwc designed for
