exede® faq what is the exede data allowance policy all exede internet plans come with our fastest speeds available in your area the only difference between the plans is the amount of data you can use every month your data allowance view the official policy document here how is my data usage measured starting on the first day of your monthly billing period all uploaded and downloaded data you use counts toward your data allowance except from midnight to  am exede classic plans or  am to  am exede evolution and exede business plan or  to  am liberty   and  that’s the free zone when usage is unmetered and does not count toward your allowance this is a great time to schedule larger downloads like movies software updates and cloud backups how am i notified that my data usage is getting high you will receive a courtesy notification email when your usage reaches  of your data allowance in a monthly measurement period we will send a second email alerting you when you’ve reached  of your data allowance what happens if i go over my data allowance if your total data usage exceeds the data allowance we may significantly slow andor restrict your service until the end of your monthly measurement period at the end of each monthly measurement period your data usage meter resets to zero and you can use your full data allowance again if your service has been slowed andor restricted due to excessive use it will be restored do i get the free zone if i’m on the freedom plan no you don’t need it if you have the freedom plan you get virtually unlimited data without a strict data allowance during all hours of the day and night that means you don’t need to wait until the wee hours to download movies music and other big files for more details please see the bandwidth usage policy associated with the freedom plan how do i keep track of how much data i’m using we encourage you to monitor your usage customers who receive their exede internet bill directly from us and not through another provider such as dish or a local telephone or electric company may review their current data usage online go to the customer portal myexedenet note myexede is currently available to exede classic subscribers evolution and freedom subscribers will be added in the near future evolution exede business freedom and wildblue subscribers will continue to access their account billing information as before log in with your username and password you’ll see your usage prominently displayed on the dashboard once you’re logged in for additional information on monitoring your usage please read our help center article about data usage does the data usage measure operate in real time no usage records are sent from the modem in minute intervals so even if you unplug your modem to check the meter it will record usage and send those records once the modem is plugged back in making it appear as if usage was incurred while the modem was unplugged what if i receive my service through another provider see the chart below to review the policy from the company that sends your monthly service bill please note that these policies may be called the “fair access policy” rather than the “data allowance policy” does wildblue have the same data allowance policy as exede no the wildblue service is measured using a different data allowance policy what are my data allowance policy usage thresholds please note your download and upload data usage is combined if you are a wildblue recovery act program subscriber your data allowance shall be as stated in the recovery act addendum to your customer agreement exede evolution and exede freedom have a different kind of data plan see below for more or call  for details how can i get a higher data allowance if you currently have the evolution  gb or  gb service plan you may upgrade to a different service plan which provides a larger monthly data allowance there may be some other options depending on where you live contact customer care for more information if you occasionally need more data in a single month our buy more feature gives you the flexibility to purchase more data in  gb increments for  per gb call  for details if i use my full data allowance is my access restored at full speed during the free zone yes your speeds and access will return to normal during the free zone even if you have no data allowance remaining during your billing cycle what are my data allowances with exede evolution exede evolution gives you unlimited access to web pages and email with some restrictions it also has a gb data allowance for everything else such as video music streaming downloads and more what are my data allowances with exede freedom there is no data allowance customers who use greater than  gbs of data during their monthly billing period may be contacted and given the option to reduce their usage or transition to another service plan per the bandwidth usage policy service is for residential and noncommercial use only what type of usage may cause me to exceed my data allowance some activities use more data than others here are a few examples fulllength movie downloads access by others if you have an unsecured wireless router heavy use of peertopeer pp file sharing programs continuous downloading or viewing streaming media content such as online video and radio extended use of web cameras extensive downloading of large applications or files extensive uploading of home movies photos andor large email attachments extensive use of online backup services such as carbonite mozy sos icloud and hp upline some kinds of gaming for discussion about these situations please visit our online community what kind of speeds does exede offer we have two exede services available depending on your region exede a  mbps downstream   mbps upstream service in the regions covered by our new viasat satellite that’s  out of  households in the us exede a  mbps downstream   mbps upstream service for most of the rest of the nation i have no idea how much data i need how do i choose an exede plan we can help call  and we will assist you with your data requirements do i get the highest speed available no matter which plan i buy yes we believe that you should not have to pay extra in order to get the highest speed we offer how can you offer such fast speeds isn’t satellite internet supposed to be really slow exede high speed internet is the culmination of a process that began in  when viasat started construction on its nextgeneration satellite viasat the new technology delivers the most significant capacity leap in the history of satellite technology what about latency the reason older versions of satellite internet service were slow had more to do with the technology available at the time than latency our satellites are in orbit a bit more than  miles above the earth but the speed of light is approximately  miles per second so while there is a tiny bit of latency it’s not enough to make a big difference in most uses of the internet our new service incorporates groundbreaking web acceleration technology which dramatically speeds up page load times minimizing the effect of latency so in addition to the much higher speeds enabled by our high capacity satellite you will experience a much faster more responsive web browsing experience can i use voip internet phone on the exede service yes we recently launched exede voice which is optimized specifically for our network and includes unlimited local and longdistance calling in the us and canada see the exede voice page for details other voip services usually work fine with exede but you’ll likely see much better results with exede voice plus calls don’t count toward your data allowance as they would with other voip services can i use vpn virtual private network on the exede service virtual private networks ‘vpn’ and other remote computer access software such as those used to connect business servers to athome workers may be very slow with exede internet some vpns may not work at all what about gaming with exede satellite internet service the performance of some games is very poor or some may not work at all read more on how latency impacts gaming what’s the installation process like a certified professional installer quickly and efficiently installs equipment and activates the exede internet service at your chosen location the satellite minidish is about  inches wide by  inches high and can be easily mounted on a roof outside wall or in the ground a cable from the dish connects to the modem which connects to your computer via an ethernet connection can i install my own dish no installation requires an installation professional to make sure that the dish is pointed at the satellite accurately and to verify that all connections are made properly will my home owners association allow mounting the exede dish the exede dish comes under the fcc overtheair reception devices rule this means it has the same classification as other residential dishes like satellite television and legally permissible for mounting on your home as always please check with your hoa for specific rules and covenants i’m a current wildblue customer can i get the new exede service absolutely as a valued current customer we want you to experience the superfast speeds of exede internet the upgrade will require a brand new satellite dish and modem which will be installed and configured by a certified technician we may be able to use the existing wiring and bracket for the satellite dish outside your home the new service does require a new month contract to get started but there is usually no fee for upgrading please call us at  so we can fill you in on all the details what if i choose to stay with my current wildblue service we remain dedicated to providing high quality service to customers who wish to continue their wildblue service in fact since the launch of exede internet we have implemented technology upgrades for wildblue customers that have resulted in much faster speeds who is viasat viasat is the company delivering both the existing wildblue service and the new exede
