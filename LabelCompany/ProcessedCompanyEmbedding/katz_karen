have always been interested in folk art from around the world indian miniatures mexican ceramics fabrics chagall matisse childrens art and primitive painting and i love to paint and experiment with pattern texture collage and color the careers ive hadas a costume designer a quilt maker a fabric artist and a graphic designerhave taken all these interests into account looking back i can see that these passions and career choices have played a large part in influencing me to become a childrens book author and illustratorbut most importantly it was after my husband and i adopted our daughter from guatemala that i was inspired to do a childrens book for her my first book over the moon was the story of that magical experience of welcoming our daughter lena into our lives i painted i drew i collaged and i wrote and after working very hard a beautiful book was born twentytwo books later my daughternow fourteen years oldstill is an inspiration for mei am fascinated by babies and little kids the simplest words and gestures can make them laugh sometimes standing in line at the supermarket and watching kids in grocery carts my best ideas are borni am fascinated by people from all over the world and what they look like and how they live and the differences that make us all uniquewhen an idea pops into my head i ask these questionswill a child want to read this book will a parent want to read this book with their child will this book make a parent and child feel somethingis there something visual here that will hold a childs interestwill a child see something in a different way after reading this bookif the answer is yes then i know im on the right tracki am very lucky to get to do what i do everyday i go into my studio and have fun dont get me wrong some days are very frustrating sometimes the colors are all wrong and the words dont sound right but after i work at it for a whileand try to do it a different wayand thinkand change the words or colorsand try some moresuddenly there it isa great page of writing or a great illustration and nothing is more satisfying than that see more customers also bought items by roger priddy margaret wise sandra boynton nina
