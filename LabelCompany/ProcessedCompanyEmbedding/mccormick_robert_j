time at the homes of his fathers first cousin in downtown chicago and lake forest illinois in his later years and until his death he lived at his estate named cantigny in wheaton illinois amanda mccormick – youngest daughter of family patriarch robert mccormick had married fellow virginian hugh adams – before moving to chicago to start the mccormick  adams grain trading business their son

trespass and asked for the case to be heard again by september adams filed another lawsuit claiming that mccormick had a former chauffeur arrested and interrogated by a private detective the opposition press made the most out of the scandals adams presented mccormick with a bill for eight years of lodging and claimed mccormick had wickedly and maliciously debauched and carnally knew the said amy irwin adams while his guest mccormick then claimed he had made loans to adams which had to be repaid the case was heard by federal court judge kenesaw mountain landis in november it was hinted that mccormick had promised to forgive the loans if the divorce was not contested landis ruled in favor of mccormick in february  on march   mccormick married amy irwin adams after waiting the year after the divorce as required by law at the time the wedding was in the registry office of st georges hanover square in london with only two witnesses present the tribune did not mention the

was  and he was  at the time she lived until july   he had no children from either marriage in failing health since an attack of pneumonia in april  mccormick nevertheless remained active in his work until the month before he died on april   he was buried on his farm in his war uniform legacyedit mccormick was regarded as a remote coldly aloof ruthless aristocrat living in lonely magnificence disdaining the common people an exceptional man a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to but at the same time had to be feared an eccentric misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him mccormick was described by one opponent as the greatest mind of the fourteenth century and by the american labor historian art preis as a fascistminded multimillionaire in his memoirs publisher henry regnery described his meeting with mccormick and william henry chamberlin the colonel received us in his rather feudal office high above michigan avenue at the top of his gothic tower he was a tall erect distinguishedlooking man who with his white hair blue eyes ruddy complexion white mustache and in his manner and dress conveyed the impression that he might have come from the english landed aristocracy he was perfectly cordial but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in washington were no basis for familiarity the new york times said he did consider himself an aristocrat and his imposing stature— feet  inches  cm tall with a muscular body weighing over  pounds  kg his erect soldierly bearing his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role but if he was one he was an aristocrat according to his friends in the best sense of the word despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites dilettantes or mere pleasureseekers whose company clubs and amusements he avoided with an extraordinary capacity for hard work he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding in his seventies he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties mccormick tribune freedom museum was funded by the foundation within days of mccormicks death richard j daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate chicago this time aligned with the democratic party for over half a century since mccormick had long advocated building a convention center after it was built from  to  mccormick place was named for him upon his death mccormick left an estate estimated at  million and set up a charitable trust in his will the northwestern university school of law building that opened in  was named mccormick hall after a donation from the foundation after a donation to renovate the technological institute building at northwestern university in  the robert r mccormick school of engineering and applied science was named for him formerly called the mccormick tribune foundation the trust divested its ownership of the tribune company so in  changed its name to simply the mccormick foundation it contributed more than a billion us dollars for journalism early childhood education civic health social and economic services arts and culture and citizenship additionally he endowed five scholarships at the citadel the military college of south carolina and deeded his aiken south carolina estate to friend and former commander charles pelot summerall with the stipulation that the general live there the remainder of his life after summeralls death in  the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in isle of palms south carolina now known as the robert r mccormick citadel beach club the

ruthless aristocrat living in lonely magnificence disdaining the common people an exceptional man a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to but at the same time had to be feared an eccentric misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him mccormick was described by one opponent as the greatest mind of the fourteenth century and by the american labor historian art preis as a fascistminded multimillionaire in his memoirs publisher henry regnery described his meeting with mccormick and william henry chamberlin the colonel received us in his rather feudal office high above michigan avenue at the top of his gothic tower he was a tall erect distinguishedlooking man who with his white hair blue eyes ruddy complexion white mustache and in his manner and dress conveyed the impression that he might have come from the english landed aristocracy he was perfectly cordial but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in washington were no basis for familiarity the new york times said he did consider himself an aristocrat and his imposing stature— feet  inches  cm tall with a muscular body weighing over  pounds  kg his erect soldierly bearing his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role but if he was one he was an aristocrat according to his friends in the best sense of the word despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites dilettantes or mere pleasureseekers whose company clubs and amusements he avoided with an extraordinary capacity for hard work he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding in his seventies he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties mccormick tribune freedom museum was funded by the foundation within days of mccormicks death richard j daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate chicago this time aligned with the democratic party for over half a century since mccormick had long advocated building a convention center after it

the stipulation that the general live there the remainder of his life after summeralls death in  the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in isle of palms south carolina now known as the robert r mccormick citadel beach club the structure was destroyed by hurricane hugo in  and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events in canada

familiarity the new york times said he did consider himself an aristocrat and his imposing stature— feet  inches  cm tall with a muscular body weighing over  pounds  kg his erect soldierly bearing his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role but if he was one he was an aristocrat according to his friends in the best sense of the word despising the idle

his farm in his war uniform legacyedit mccormick was regarded as a remote coldly aloof ruthless aristocrat living in lonely magnificence disdaining the common people an exceptional man a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to but at the same time had to be feared an eccentric misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him mccormick was described by one opponent as the greatest mind of the fourteenth century and by the american labor historian art preis as a fascistminded multimillionaire in his memoirs publisher henry regnery described his meeting with mccormick and william henry chamberlin the colonel received us in his rather feudal office high above michigan avenue at the top of his gothic tower he was a tall erect distinguishedlooking man who with his white hair blue eyes ruddy complexion white mustache and in his manner and dress conveyed the impression that he might have come from the english landed aristocracy he was perfectly cordial but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in washington were no basis for familiarity the new york times said he did consider himself an aristocrat and his imposing stature— feet  inches  cm tall with a muscular body weighing over  pounds  kg his erect soldierly bearing his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role but if he was one he was an aristocrat according to his friends in the best sense of the word despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites dilettantes or mere pleasureseekers whose company clubs and amusements he avoided with an extraordinary capacity for hard work he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding in his seventies he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties mccormick tribune freedom museum was funded by the foundation within days of mccormicks death richard j daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate chicago this time aligned with the democratic party for over half a century since mccormick had long advocated building a convention center after it was built from  to  mccormick place was named for him upon his death mccormick left an estate estimated at  million and set up a charitable trust in his will the northwestern university school of law building that opened in  was named mccormick hall after a donation from the foundation after a donation to renovate the technological institute building at northwestern university in  the robert r mccormick school of engineering and applied science was named for him formerly called the mccormick tribune foundation the trust divested its ownership of the tribune company so in  changed its name to simply the mccormick foundation it contributed more than a billion us dollars for journalism early childhood education civic health social and economic services arts and culture and citizenship additionally he endowed five scholarships at the citadel the military college of south carolina and deeded his aiken south carolina estate to friend and former commander charles pelot summerall with the stipulation that the general live there the remainder of his life after summeralls death in  the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in isle of palms south carolina now known as the robert r mccormick citadel beach club the structure was destroyed by hurricane hugo in  and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events in canada his legacy is even more important as  towns were created for the purpose of forestry and journal paper production heron bay ont gore bay ont thorold ont baiecomeau que franquelin que and shelter bay que known as portcartier today these towns still exist and if yesterdays productions are no longer what make them

married the much younger amie de houle amy irwin born in  the daughter of decorated soldier bernard j d irwin on april   however starting in november  a bitter family dispute developed amy filed for divorce claiming adams was alcoholic which was granted on march   without her husband appearing in court adams filed a lawsuit against mccormick for trespass and asked for the case to be heard again by september adams filed another lawsuit claiming that mccormick had a former chauffeur arrested and interrogated by a private detective the opposition press made the most out of the scandals adams presented mccormick with a bill for eight years of lodging and claimed mccormick had wickedly and maliciously debauched and carnally knew the said amy irwin adams while his guest mccormick then claimed he had made loans to adams which had to be repaid the case was heard by federal court judge kenesaw mountain landis in november it was hinted that mccormick had promised to forgive the loans if the divorce was not contested landis ruled in favor of mccormick in february  on march   mccormick married amy irwin adams after waiting the year after the divorce as required by law at the time the wedding was in the registry office of st georges hanover square in london with only two witnesses present the tribune did not mention the wedding nor any of the previous lawsuits after she died in  he became a near social recluse on december   he married mrs maryland mathison hooper in the apartment of his cousin chauncey mccormick she was  and he was  at the time she lived until july   he had no children from either marriage in failing health since an attack of pneumonia in april  mccormick nevertheless remained active in his work until the month before he died on april   he was buried on his farm in his war uniform legacyedit mccormick was regarded as a remote coldly aloof ruthless aristocrat living in lonely magnificence disdaining the common people an exceptional man a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to but at the same time had to be feared an eccentric misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him mccormick was described by one opponent as the greatest mind of the fourteenth century and by the american labor historian art preis as a fascistminded multimillionaire in his memoirs publisher henry regnery described his meeting with mccormick and william henry chamberlin the colonel received us in his rather feudal office high above michigan avenue at the top of his gothic tower he was a tall erect distinguishedlooking man who with his white hair blue eyes ruddy complexion white mustache and in his manner and dress conveyed the impression that he might have come from the english landed aristocracy he was perfectly cordial but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in washington were no basis for familiarity the new york times said he did consider himself an aristocrat and his imposing stature— feet  inches  cm tall with a muscular body weighing over  pounds  kg his erect soldierly bearing his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role but if he was one he was an aristocrat according to his friends in the best sense of the word despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites dilettantes or mere pleasureseekers whose company clubs and amusements he avoided with an extraordinary capacity for hard work he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding in his seventies he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties mccormick tribune freedom museum was funded by the foundation within days of mccormicks death richard j daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate chicago this time aligned with the democratic party for over half a century since mccormick had long advocated building a convention center after it was built from  to  mccormick place was named for him upon his death mccormick left an estate estimated at  million and set up a charitable trust in his will the northwestern university school of law building that opened in  was named mccormick hall after a donation from the foundation after a donation to renovate the technological institute building at northwestern university in  the robert r mccormick school of engineering and applied science was named for him formerly called the mccormick tribune foundation the trust divested its ownership of the tribune company so in  changed its name to simply the mccormick foundation it contributed more than a billion us dollars for journalism early childhood education civic health social and economic services arts and culture and citizenship additionally he endowed five scholarships at the citadel the military college of south carolina and deeded his aiken south carolina estate to friend and former commander charles pelot summerall with the stipulation that the general live there the remainder of his life after summeralls death in  the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in isle of palms south carolina now known as the robert r mccormick citadel beach club the structure was destroyed by hurricane hugo in  and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events in canada his legacy is even more important as  towns were created for the purpose of forestry and journal paper production

   back to gallery glenville with a yearly pay and benefits package of more than  million robert j mccormick of trustco bank is the highestpaid ceo at any publicly traded company in the capital region and the yearold mccormick who has been chief executive of the  billion bank since  stands well apart from his peers according to  compensation data compiled by the times union mccormick makes twice as much as the next ceo on the list which is composed of leaders of local public companies — those that must disclose the compensation of their top executives and board members to federal regulators as a requirement of their stock market listing number two on the list is thomas dambra who earned  million in  as ceo of albany molecular research inc an albany drug maker however dambra one of albany moleculars founders and consistently one of the regions highestpaid executives retired at the end of last year while mccormicks earnings may seem excessive to the average worker trustco board members and the majority of trustco stockholders believe hes worth every penny more information base salaries and total compensation in  for chief executive officers of publicly traded companies in the

ago at mallozzis banquet hall in rotterdam trustco shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favor of mccormicks compensation package is a base salary of  plus stock retirement benefits and other perks that total  the nonbinding vote was never in doubt with  percent of the ballots cast approving the compensation for mccormick and his four top lieutenants its unclear how the average trustco stockholder voted because large institutional shareholders such as mutual funds that own millions of shares control large blocks of the voting however  million shares — roughly six percent of the total that voted — were against the packages given to mccormick and his management team including chief financial officer robert cushing who earned nearly  million in  trustco did not respond to a request for comment on this story and neither did joseph lucarelli chairman of trustcos board of directors lucarelli  is president of traditional builders a residential homebuilding company based in schenectady he also led the board committee that sets mccormicks annual pay however documents that were filed with the us securities and exchange commission show that lucarelli and the rest of trustcos independent directors who earn  annually from the bank as board members were methodical in determining what mccormick is worth although mccormicks total compensation has risen  percent over the past two years the board has kept mccormicks base salary frozen since  much of the rest of mccormicks package which includes a mix of stock options and cash is incentivebased and depends on the bank achieving certain financial targets trustco had a very good  earnings were up  percent over  and key metrics such as return on equity despositsperbranch and loan quality also improved another factor that favored mccormick was the surge in trustcos stock which appreciated  percent in  compared with  percent for the banks peer group which includes  similarly sized banks that compete in trustcos markets in new york new jersey and florida the banks board attributes this exceptional performance in part to the efforts of the companys executive officers  whose efforts are encouraged and rewarded by the companys executive compensation program lucarelli and the other board members wrote in a letter to shareholders before the annual meeting according to sec filings mccormicks compensation total also includes some perks that most workers could never dream of including a company car and a country club membership most other local ceos dont get that treatment especially in this postrecession economy but its a common practice in the financial sector where a lot of business is still done on the golf course says hal gueutal a professor at the university at albanys school of business who studies executive compensation this is more common among small to midsized banks where personal networks are critical and often the business community is smaller gueutal said albany
