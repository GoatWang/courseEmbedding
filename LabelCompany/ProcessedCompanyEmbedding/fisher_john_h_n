pressure temperature fisher� positioners have the reputation of providing the most accurate robust and reliable performance in the industry electropneumatic positioners electromechanical positioners are conventional pneumatic positioners that have an additional integrated electropneumatic transducer pneumatic positioners conventional pneumatic positioners receive a pneumatic control signal and translate that into the appropriate pneumatic output signal to the control valve actuator fisher� field instrumentation fisher� field mounted instruments provide monitoring and control to final control devices transducers controllers volume boosters solenoids and switches are used to monitor and control flow temperature pressure and level variables in the process industry level sensors fisher level sensors in conjunction with either fieldvue dlc series digital level controllers or  series controllers and transmitters are designed to measure changes level switches onoff switch that senses high or low liquid levels a displacer is used as the sensor and is located in an external cage that mounts to the outside of a vessel level transmitters both digital electronic and pneumatic displacement level controllers are used for accurate level measurement or precision level loop control liquid level controller  electric the electric onoff level controller is used to sense liquid level and when used in conjuction with the fisher� easydrive� electric actuator form a fully electric level control loop which eliminates pneumatic controller and dump valve venting liquid level
