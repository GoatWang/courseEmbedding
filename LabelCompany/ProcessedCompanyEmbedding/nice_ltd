products   our enterprise interaction solutions include recording monitoring quality management and business performance management solutions which are designed to capture interactions analyze them and take action based on this analysis to drive the enterprise performance they also protect businesses and customers against risks posed by lost or misinterpreted voice or data transmissions and capture and improve contact center agent performance and the customers experience    interaction capture units known as voice recorders or loggers are systems that capture and record large volumes of voice data transmitted over multiple telephone or other communication lines and allow users to retrieve and playback specific communication data traditional voice recorders were based on analog reeltoreel technology which limited an organizations ability to store and retrieve data efficiently and which could not interface with digital computer and telecommunication networks in the early s analog reeltoreel recorders began to be replaced with analog vhsbased products and more recently by digital products including those based on magnetic disk optical disk or digital audio tapes or dat  organizations growing needs to record process and store large amounts of voice data resulted in the introduction of digitallybased voice recording systems characterized by increased performance and improved system economics  digital multichannel recording systems enable simultaneous recording and logging of a large number of channels while enabling a large number of users to process voice data simultaneously digital systems advantages over traditional analog systems include the immediate random access to recorded data open connectivity and compact size of both the recording unit and storing and archiving media advanced industrystandard digital voice recording systems employing computer telephony integration or cti technologies allow for integration of the recording and retrieval functions with organizations computer and telecommunications networks thereby delivering maximum business benefits increased user efficiency and wider access for larger numbers of users  the demand for sophisticated cti digital voice recording systems is increasing as a result of the increased demand for digital recording systems particularly in the contact center market and the conversion by the large installed base of analog systems to digital technology specifically in the financial institutions public safety and air traffic control markets   todays business is characterized by increasing reliance upon interactions conducted via telephony and webbased communications these means of communication are becoming an important and strategic dimension of business across a broad spectrum of markets in these business environments a great deal of information lies hidden within the evergrowing quantities of unstructured multimedia interactions this information can provide decision makers throughout the enterprise with insights into their marketplace and customer base and direct access to key business scenarios many of these capabilities are not available with traditional transactionalbased analytics tools they are of great value to organizations constantly searching for better ways to understand their market dynamics and customer intent while operating within the limitations of traditional surveying and data analysis techniques and growing regulatory requirements      nice perform is our flagship enterprise product it is an integrated suite of solutions that offers innovative ways for organizations to generate insight from interactions to enhance performance nice perform combines multiple data sources in a fully integrated architecture with

interactions in a format optimized for multidimensional analytics   while providing critical statistical data nice perform goes beyond the scope of transactional analytics to help decision makers understand customer intent and market dynamics identify current and future trends early enough for proactive management of challenges opportunities and changes and enhance corporate governance throughout the enterprise for example marketing executives can more effectively track marketing campaigns analyze causes of success or failure and quickly adapt to changing market conditions finance and legal executives can ensure that company policies are adhered to in all phone conversations across the organization thereby avoiding costly legal action by spotting and correcting irregularities before they become problems   nice perform also contains all of the contact center quality management capabilities of niceuniverse described below in addition nice perform includes advanced online
