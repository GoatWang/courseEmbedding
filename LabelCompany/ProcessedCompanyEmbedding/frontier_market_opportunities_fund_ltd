and alexander muromcew portfolio manager tiaa emerging markets equity fund shareemailprint click here for a downloadable version pdften years ago frontier markets were largely unexplored and mostly unavailable to investors political instability very high inflation lack of infrastructure and limited access made investing in these areas too risky for most few of their major corporations had shares traded on a public exchange and those that did were often offlimits to foreigners the sovereign bond issues in existence were illiquid difficult to value and denominated in volatile local currenciesover the past five years however investor interest in frontier markets—such as paraguay dominican republic ecuador kenya nigeria and vietnam—has been growing amid low interest rates in the developed world slowing growth across many emerging markets combined with better political stability in frontier countries and improving economic stewardship in frontier markets with brazil russia india and china the bric countries and other traditional em countries such as south africa turkey mexico and indonesia dominating most emerging market portfolios investing in higher yielding and less correlated frontier markets offers a compelling way to improve a portfolio’s diversification while also providing another potential source of attractive riskadjusted returnsarticle highlights investors have shown an increased interest in frontiermarket stocks and bonds which have shown compelling yield return and diversification benefits in recent yearshigher growth improved policy making and better political stability have been driving attractive returns in these marketsunderpinning the economic activity in frontier markets are positive demographics increasing urbanization hard and soft commodities technological development and an effort to bridge the large infrastructure deficitwhile frontier markets have much in common there are also significant differences when it comes to their political and policy environments natural resource base economic structures and cyclesfrontier markets can be an added source of return and diversification for an emerging markets portfolio when combined with rigorous analysis careful security selection and appropriate sizing however risks must be carefully weighed because these markets can be volatile and illiquid at times growing interest in frontiermarket stocks and bondsfrontier markets are a relatively new and small corner of the financial universe definitions of “frontier market” vary but generally these markets are characterized as smaller and less mature than emerging markets yet still accessible to foreign investment on the equity side msci an index provider currently classifies  nations as frontier markets and its msci frontier markets index includes  constituents with a total market capitalization of 9 billion us mutual fund and etf investors have invested about  billion in frontiermarket equities since  that is a small number for the industry but considering the first retail funds in the space launched about a decade ago this growth has attracted attention the msci emerging markets index by comparison includes  constituents and has a market capitalization of  trillion us retail fund investors have put about  billion to work in these markets since fixedincome investors are also finding more opportunities in frontier markets  according to thomson reuters data in  frontier markets issued 9 billion in hardcurrency debt local bonds issued in dollars euro or yen—an almost  rise from  and nearly three times the  level this represents nearly onefifth of the more than  billion in hardcurrency bonds issued by emerging markets overall many frontiermarket debt issues were heavily oversubscribed when the ivory coast sold  million in year notes yielding  in july  investors placed orders worth  billion ethiopia’s sale of  billion year notes yielding  in december  drew bids worth  billionimproving macroeconomic policy managementinvestors have been warming up to frontier markets for many reasons including improved macroeconomic policy management and coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities additionally in order to issue debt in us dollar markets most of these governments have to bear the constant scrutiny of ratings agencies and investors which helped to improve transparency and increase data reporting frequency many frontier markets countries have also undergone positive structural reforms including reforming the power sector which has been a key drag on both economic activity and cost of doing business others have reduced fuel subsidies which have historically siphoned critical budget resources away from other needs most frontier economies have also improved their governance and ease of doing business with only a handful stalling or reversing recently this helps frontier markets attract not only portfolio investments in the form of equities and bonds but also longterm foreign direct investments and multilateralbilateral loans that are crucial for growthincreasing political stabilityit is not only economic improvement but politically—as well there is increased stability overall military in most frontier countries is now behind barracks and democracy even if less robust than other developed countries is increasingly the norm  a recent example is the presidential election in nigeria which was remarkable given that a sitting incumbent lost—setting the stage for the first peaceful transfer of power from the ruling party pdp that had led since the country ended military rule in 999attractive returns and favorable equity correlations though risks remainrecently the economic buoyancy of frontier markets has translated into compelling returns for equity and bond investors see exhibits  and  the msci frontier markets imi posted a  gain in  compared with a  decline for the msci emerging markets imi meanwhile frontiermarket bonds as represented by jp morgan’s next generation markets index nexgem which has now  frontier countries returned  outperforming the  return for the more followed jp morgan embi global diversified benchmark index where nexgem countries now represent close to  of the index for emergingmarket bondsexhibit frontier market equity correlations versus developed markets have been lower than emerging markets versus developed markets in all time periods making a good case to add securities from this asset class correlations for frontier markets versus us europe and emerging markets have been declining notably over the past three years suggesting greater divergence of returns from the other markets and thus increased diversification potential see exhibit exhibit risks also need to be understoodwhile frontier markets have performed well in recent years investors should understand the myriad risks involved which are often amplified compared to other markets terrorist attacks military coups currency volatility and developing regulatory infrastructure are just some of the risks that investors facefrontier market securities also may become highly illiquid during periods of volatility making it difficult for investors to sell when needed this was evident during the  financial crisis frontiermarket equities experienced a lower “bottom”  than the us europe and emerging markets see exhibit exhibit young expanding populations create growthwhile sometimes volatile with a high degree of risk there are many positive trends taking shape in frontier markets including population growth demographics and improving economic vibrancy and stability in many countriesby comparison some bric countries have seen a downshift in growth for example while the international monetary fund imf expects brazil’s gross domestic product gdp to grow by a mere  in  neighboring peru is expected to see  growth russia hurt by the drop in the price of oil and international sanctions due to its involvement in ukraine may just escape recession in  with  growth meanwhile a former soviet republic uzbekistan is predicted to grow underpinning the economic activity in frontier markets are young growing populations entering their peak working years and an urban migration that has historically presaged improved standards of living greater consumption and economic growth of the  countries that msci classifies as frontier markets seven placed in the top  countries for population growth according to  world bank statistics in contrast just one of the  nations the msci classifies as emerging markets—qatar—makes the top  listnot surprisingly these growing countries have a large percentage of young people in nigeria  of the population was  years old or younger as of  while in pakistan and jordan  fell into that age bracket according to world bank data that compares with  for germany and japan  for the united kingdom and  for the united statesexhibit economically some key risks are also receding in frontier markets better economic management and coordination with monetary policymakers have brought inflation down in many countries costa rica ecuador and kazakhstan had doubledigit inflation rates as recently as  but those rates are all now  or lower in sri lanka the economy is benefiting from a “peace dividend” after a year civil war ended in 9 since that time the country’s local stock market has grown fivefold in capitalization from  billion before the war ended to  billiondiversity along the frontieralthough frontier markets have some common traits there are significant differences in their individual political and economic systems access to natural resources and progress on infrastructure development for these reasons returns from one frontier market don’t usually track returns from others economic trends influencing sri lanka for example tend to be quite different than those affecting the ivory coast or paraguayfor example nigeria and kenya are both african nations that have suffered terrorist attacks in recent years however their differences are much more significant than their similarities nigeria has a population of almost  million compared with fewer than  million people in kenya and the nigerian economy is almost  times the size of kenya’s about half of nigeria’s population lives in urban areas while less than onequarter do so in kenya gdp per capita is much higher in nigeria than in kenya  nigeria is a large oil producer and exporter while kenya’s economy is more diversified focused on domestic manufacturing and tourism and to a lesser extent on agriculturesoft commodities as a result nigeria’s oil revenues make up a hefty  percent of the total making it vulnerable to a fall in prices  in the case of kenya on the other hand  domestically generated revenues through income and vat taxes are what constitute the bulk of the revenues around  percent making it a far more resilient economythese and other differences among frontier markets even those in relatively close proximity call for a highly selective approach for instance many but not all frontier markets are large exporters of natural resources such as oil nigeria angola kuwait and kazakhstan are major oil exporters while pakistan kenya jordan and jamaica are energy importers from an investment perspective it generally makes sense to invest in oilexporting nations when oil prices are strong or rising and in oil importers when oil prices are weak or fallingthe frontier futurewe consider frontier markets a deepening and extension of emerging markets an investment strategy that incorporates frontier markets using rigorous bottomup fundamental analysis and paying careful attention to the countries’ political stability and policy frameworks has the potential to add riskadjusted returns and diversification to a portfolio  although future performance can never be guaranteed frontier markets if added selectively can add value to a portfolio
