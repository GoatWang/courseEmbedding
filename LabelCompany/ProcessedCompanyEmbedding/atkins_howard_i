about us  atkins farms  a rich history in western ma howard atkins  during the last forty years there have been many changes here on the corner of bay road and rte  in amherst mass concurrently many changes have taken place in the world in our own back yards and in our individual lives worldwide our population has increased from  billion to  billion in the last forty years although the population growth is now slowing us life expectancy is rising and the hole in the ozone layer is shrinking however hunger still plagues many countries and fresh water resources may be limited in the future as use escalates the anniversary of john kennedys death was over forty years ago back to our corner of the world the very first retail building built at this location was started in june of  the building would have been built the prior year right after howard atkins purchased the land from mr critchett but when the l crop of apples froze he delayed the construction for another year when the  crop of apples made it safely past the frost season howard put the building plans back into action the steelframed onestory building  with five overhead garage doors installed to allow trucks to be driven in for the winter months cost almost twice the original estimate of  the building was ready early in august but howard was not afraid that no one would show up for the opening day howard had his wife ruth oversee the opening while he busied himself packing apples at the storage facility the opening was a success and howard was kept busy that day sorting peaches and apples for the retail business to go back another 7 years the atkins farms applegrowing business was started in 7 when howards grandfather came to south amherst and planted the first mcintosh trees the orchards were expanded over the years but the atkins sold most of their apples wholesale all just within a radius of 00 miles of the orchards in the 0s howard started selling apples out of the garage near the family home and then from the coldstorage building and cider mill he built on south east street when i came to work for howard atkins in  my oldest son mike was not yet a year old now that puts things in a different perspective for me in the s we worked out of an office in howards home on south east street where mike often came to work with me in those years howard was busy running the farms both the orchard and dairy farm working as an eastern states representative and getting a feel for the retail business he would record personal radio station ads and place newspaper ads in the holyoke transcript however the advertising job soon was delegated to me as howard concentrated on his other responsibilities the retail business soon showed promise and we could see a need for more and earlier varieties of apples for the increasing number of customers in  one hundred and fifty acres of land was purchased in belchertown the higher elevation of this land would help to assure us of an annual crop of quality apples by escaping more of the spring frosts at the same time several of the amherst orchards were getting closed in by a booming housing growth in amherst the land in belchertown was ideal more land was purchased and was cleared of woods and stone walls twenty years later there were over 00 acres of dwarf and semidwarf apple peach and pear trees covering the land as the retail business grew new products were carefully and slowly added produce was purchased from local farmers and then from the market during the winter months i can remember the first peanut butter machine and the first oven we bought to bake pies prior to that we had purchased pies from a home baker in belchertown maple syrup honey and jams and jellies were added to our product list not only did we grow in farm acreage and retail business during the late s and early s but more importantly we grew with very valuable and vital new associates in  harold gould came to work for atkins he had previously been employed with agway but came to work on the farm with howard harold soon became an indispensable part of the retail business and has remained so through the years also in  the retail business was incorporated and was outgrowing the original building andersons bay road fruit stand in  sam anderson owner of the bay road fruit stand across from the atkins store put his business up for sale and we purchased it that same year in 7 a major renovation transformed the original white steelbeamed atkins fruit bowl into a large redwood california style showplace after the additionrenovation was completed the two retail roadside stand businesses were combined and we then had an extensive selection of fresh produce in addition to our own apples peaches and pears we also added four new and valuable employees from the bay road fruit stand andy tulenko now deceased john and paul kosloski and net horne now retired andy was the key in moving the produce business from andersons to atkins and was produce manager for several years john is the current produce manager and paul is assistant manager the 7 renovation gave us room to bake more pies and we started making the first cider donuts   over 00 years of growing apples atkins fruit bowl 77 as the orchards in belchertown produced more a new storage and packing house was needed this was constructed in 77 and accommodated 0 bushels of apples the wholesale office and a new cider mill the apples raised by the farm at that time were sold about 0 wholesale and 0 through our retail store also the farm was producing over 00 gallons of cider in a year both apples and cider were sold throughout massachusetts connecticut and new york in 77 the greenhouse area was added on to the retail building and in 0 a full line bakery kitchen was added we were then able to make our own pies in addition to many new bakery products including cakes pastries muffins donuts breads rolls and coffee cakes as we watched thousands of customers pass through our doors each day howard knew how foolish he had been to worry about whether anyone would show up that first day in  in 7 another major player on the atkins team was hired paul hodgkins now partowner and assistant manager says he came to work at atkins about the time when we downsized the greenhouse business and moved our one foot deli case out to the greenhouse area at the same time we added a larger cheese case a salad bar and more specialty foods fortunately howard was still with us to help oversee our next major renovation and addition in  when we doubled the size of our building to  square feet the skeleton of the original building was incorporated into this renovation where the bakery sales area of the store now is howard was very proud rightfully so when that renovation was completed and over the next two years he was able to see the many positive results in contrast the wholesaling of apples became depressed as new orchards began producing an abundance of fruit most years the wholesale price for apples didnt cover our expense of growing them therfore we have made several uturns in the production of apples from the original allwholesale production when the farm first started in the late 00s to mostly retail until the newer orchards planted in the s began to produce enough apples for wholesale and then back to our present position of growing apples primarily for the store from over 00 acres of apples we now grow fruit on  acres in both belchertown our peachberry hill orchards off bay road we look at this change as streamlining our production so that we are more efficient and we can concentrate on growing the best quality fruit for our own store we have always maintained that we have eyes for the future and it is true we try to plan ahead to keep up with customer demand and to keep up with our growth in order to do that we once again renovated and added on to our store in 0000 much of the addition is work area and storage but we also rearranged cases on the retail floor freeing up the area around the deli adding more cases for meat seafood prepared and partially prepared foods we also have a larger area for what we call convenience items such as baking ingredients canned goods paper goods and pet foods over the years our lives here have changed as we adjust to the loss of family and friends we also gain new family and friends and delight in their being a part of our lives and as i speak of the past history of atkins farms and the growth of the retail store howard atkins is upper most in my mind much of our success is due to his energy and enthusiasm his encouragement and faith in others as we said in our rememberance of howard when he passed away in 7 he was our friend leader mentor sponsor founder and role model he was what we needed and when we needed it compassionate inspirational dedicated concerned thrifty organized a smart problem solver uplifting analytical encouraging and honest atkins farms country market
