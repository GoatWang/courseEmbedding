morningstar rating™ among  morningstar multialternative funds based on riskadjusted return for the period ending i overview managers performance fund data fact sheet commentary we couldnt find a core alternatives strategy that we liked so we created one riskmanagement goals lower risk and lower volatility than the stock market inherently lower risk because of the nature of each managers investment universe andor because of the way in which each manager addresses risk low risk of negative returns over any given oneyear time period relatively low correlation to stock and bond market indexes volatility in the range of  to  risk control is intended to be a function of several factors including the inherent risk level of the strategies the risk sensitive nature of the managers the skill of the managers and the overall strategy diversification return goals strong absolute relative and riskadjusted returns over full market cycles managers can take advantage of the additional flexibility that comes from a multimanager structure and in some cases invest in ways that only accredited investors would usually have access to for example our managers can use leverage portfolio concentration and take advantage of lessliquid opportunities flexibility to take advantage of compelling opportunities that arise when valuations become severely depressed litman gregory may tactically alter each subadvisors allocation to take advantage of particularly compelling opportunities for a specific strategy or to further manage risk other key features highly competitive cost transparent and understandable highly experienced managers chosen for their specialized and demonstrated expertise and for their complementary lowcorrelation investment approaches each manager runs individualized sleeves for litman gregory this is not a fund of funds a mix of strategies and managers not available in a single publicly available mutual fund the funds role in a portfolio we consider the fund a substitute for a portion of a portfolios exposure to traditional stocks and bonds if the fund meets our goals litman gregory believes that owning it as a core holding has the potential to offer returns that are as good as or better than the stockbond mix from which it was funded with less volatility and downside risk and added diversification  there are no guarantees that the fund will meet

by fiduciary fiduciary seeks to buy that have durable franchises ie franchises that can survive difficult times and whose common stock is trading below fmi s estimated intrinsic value of the company fmi s investment process has always focused on evaluating three attributes of a company the quality of the business model the valuation and the quality of management assessing the quality of a business is a primary research focus fiduciary defines a good business model as one that has a defensible niche and that can survive the ups and downs of a business cycle in a defensible niche fmi looks for with a high degree of recurring revenue a wellestablished customer base andor sustainable competitive advantage typically businesses that meet these characteristics are wellestablished with modest growth profiles the fmi investment team will review  years of sec filings and shareholder reports to understand a company s business model and where necessary adjust a company s investment capital base for illegitimate writeoffs due to bad acquisitions for example to get a reliable picture of a company s historical return on invested capital  roic  then the team will conduct a deeper analysis of the drivers of a company s roic such as revenue growth margins capital expenditure etc going back at least  quarters in addition they will meet with andor have conference calls with management of the company as well as its suppliers competitors and customers fmi s work on a company s business model and quality helps identify which valuation metrics such as priceearnings pe enterprise value ev to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda pricesales ps etc should be utilized for estimating a company s intrinsic value this work is also valuable in assessing whether or not the business model has changed significantly over time making historical comparisons irrelevant if that is the case fmi will analyze the trading of a stock based on various valuation metrics over a  to year time period relative to the broad market and its peers across different economic  cycles and with different underlying company fundamentals such as margins topline growth competitive positioning capital intensity of the business etc this historical valuation analysis may be supplemented by other valuation techniques such as sumoftheparts analysis ie valuing different pieces of a business separately and valuation based on private and publicmarket transaction data for example valuation multiples used in an acquisition which may assume greater importance when historical comparisons are less relevant such as where business models have changed or management strategy has shifted fmi is not looking for a specific discount to its estimate of intrinsic value but if its valuation analysis suggests that a stock is undervalued in absolute terms andor in relation to its future profitability roic in this case and downside risks are limited then the stock is a strong candidate for purchase in general fmi does not aim to be precise with its valuation analysis and will come up with pricetarget ranges over three to five years these price targets are generally within a narrow range and they guide fmi on when to trim or sell a stock fmi also focuses on areas that company management can control therefore fmi will look at the backgrounds of management teams this may involve assessing their experience and track record reviewing proxy statements to assess whether management compensation and incentives are in line with shareholder interests evaluating past management decisions to assess whether or not those decisions enhanced shareholder value and discussing with management their strategy and execution plan to assess the likelihood of meeting their stated goals and objectives the following two paragraphs replace the first and the second paragraph of the description of clyde s mcgregor of harris associates lp in the section titled

fund s holdings at any point in time to meet the definition of a small company but the smaller companies fund has the flexibility to hold midsized if the managers believe that holding these will lead

performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates

evaluate how the world is evolving and to incorporate their opinions about these changes into the firms assessment of risk and investment allocations the firm also offers access to investments in mutual funds and private investment vehicleslgams investment strategies begin with a neutral asset allocation that reflects what they believe is a sensible static asset allocation for a hypothetical longterm investor who is not actively allocating assets asset classes in the neutral allocation for their basic portfolio strategies include investment grade bonds largecap us stocks smallcap us stocks and foreign stocks they shift portfolio allocations away from the neutral allocation only when fear or greed has driven prices of a certain asset class to unjustified extremes at the margin lgams asset allocation decisions may also be influenced by longterm trends that the firm believes will have a significant impact on the future investment climate the firm also uses scenario analysis to manage portfolio allocations risk exposure this involves testing the impact on the portfolio of various economic and market scenarios if lgam identifies an opportunity to manage risk better this analysis may result in adjustments to a portfolios asset allocation lgam maintains at least a  year time horizon the firm analyzes and chooses actively managed mutual funds or private investments and
