actually administer these plans itself but its members may secure lower premiums on them due to the company’s negotiating powerumbrella insurance usaa’s umbrella insurance policies offer additional

cash back bonus when you close on a new home through one of these agents this ranges from  on homes worth  or less to  on homes worth  million or moreshopping and service discounts usaa offers discounts on products and services through partnerships with individual companies for instance members get special deals usaa doesn’t specify how much on home security systems with adt storage systems with pods and flowers with ftdsubscriber’s account distributions and allocationsevery member who purchases a usaa insurance policy receives a subscriber’s account administered by the company’s board of directors this account holds a portion of usaa’s capital reserves this is a key feature of usaa’s legal structure as a cooperative organization every member literally owns a piece of the company and the subscriber’s account represents that ownershipyour subscriber’s account balance is proportional to the total amount of insurance premiums you’ve paid with a percentage of each premium payment deposited into the account the percentage is determined by the board of directors may vary year to year and isn’t public this is usaa’s money so you can’t withdraw it but if the company turns a profit and meets financial performance goals set by the board of directors variable from year to year it may distribute a portion of your subscriber’s account balance to you by paper check or direct deposit into your usaa bank account in december of each year the distribution amount varies from year to year and is based on the company’s financial performance your account balance and your lifetime premium paymentsonce you’ve been a member for  years you become eligible for an additional senior bonus payable in february of each year the amount of this extra bonus is subject to the same conditions as the regular bonusadvantages huge range of products and services under one roofcompared to many other financial institutions that do the bulk of their business online usaa offers an impressive lineup of products and services most types of insurance brokerage and retirement accounts checking and savings accounts and several types of loans it also offers valueadded perks like rebates on auto and home purchases discounts on other purchases and id theft protectionwith usaa it’s possible to take care of most or all of you financial needs under one roof by contrast capital one  offers lots of banking products and access to an online brokerage in sharebuilder but no loans or insurance products allstate provides a similarly comprehensive range of insurance products but no banking or brokerage accounts life insurance policies don’t include a war clauseusaa life insurance policies don’t withhold or restrict death benefits for policyholders who die in war or violent conflict if you’re an activeduty servicemember who dies in overseas fighting your family will receive the same benefits as if you had died peacefully on us soil by contrast most other life insurance issuers limit payouts in cases of conflictrelated death activeduty servicemembers who face overseas deployment may have to pay higher premiums the potential for annual profit distributions to membersin addition to rebates and discounts on auto and home insurance and other purchases usaa returns capital to its members in other ways when you buy an insurance policy from the company you automatically receive a subscriber’s account that holds a portion of usaa’s capital if the company meets the annual financial performance goals set by the board of directors you’re entitled to receive an annual payout from this amount that could range from a few dollars to several hundredif you’ve been a member for more than  years you’re entitled to an even juicier annual payout most traditional insurance companies such as allstate and progressive aren’t memberowned and thus don’t offer annual distributions to members access to flood insurancethe femarun national flood insurance program nfip underwrites all flood insurance policies issued in the united states so many insurance companies including powerhouses such as allstate and geico don’t bother to offer their customers the opportunity to obtain flood insurance instead directing them to nfip by contrast usaa’s members can buy nfipunderwritten policies directly through one of the company’s subsidiaries this allows you to conduct all your insurance business through one insurer trading discounts are attractiveusaa offers attractive trading commission discounts for brokerage accountholders who trade often and in higher amounts but they’re not prohibitive for people who aren’t made of money and don’t make multiple trades per day with a discount of  per trade to  when you make more than  trades in a day period or carry an account balance of  usaa’s brokerage is a better deal than td ameritrade etrade and other online brokerages with a similar range of offeringsdisadvantages many products aren’t available to nonmemberssince it restricts membership to military personnel and qualifying family members usaa’s full product lineup isn’t available to most americans as a nonmember you may be eligible to open a brokerage account purchase life insurance and take advantage of its shopping discounts but usaa reserves the right to close these services to nonmembers so it’s best to check with the company before making a decision eligibility is much less restrictive at insurance providers and financial institutions that aren’t memberowned such as allstate and capital one  cd and savings rates aren’t competitive relative to other online banksusaa’s cd and savings account rates tend to be on the low end especially compared to online banks like ally bank and everbank most rates on usaa’s cds with multiyear terms range between  and  and the highest available usaa cd yield is  on a sevenyear super jumbo cd which requires a  minimum depositby contrast ally bank offers an month cd at about the same rate – and with no minimum deposit also its fiveyear cd yields  customer service is cumbersome and confusingusaa has live customer service professionals but reaching them can be tricky though there’s a main number –  usaa – with a touchtone menu to direct you to the right department the sheer number of departments makes this timeconsuming so usaa advises you to call your desired division iras mortgage auto loans and so on directlyhowever this requires you to look up the pertinent number in its online directory which can also take time and since its offices are closed on the weekend calling on monday can be stressful and timeconsuming – so much so that usaa advises members to call tuesday through friday instead by contrast ally bank’s customer service team is available  by phone often with wait times of just a few minutesseparately usaa doesn’t have a live chat feature on its website – if you don’t want to call you need to email a customer service professional and wait hours or days depending on volume for a response ally and other online banks have live web chat website is dense and difficult to navigateusaa’s website is difficult to navigate and its most important parts – including dropdown menus – are clogged with small text this makes it difficult to use on a mobile device also some of the site’s pages seem out of step with web browser navigation tools for instance when you click the back button from a subpage you may be taken all the way back to the home page even if you hadn’t been there in some timefinal wordserving in the military is an honorable calling that demands tremendous sacrifice if you’re an activeduty retired or honorably separated servicemember or are related to someone who fits that bill you may be eligible for membership in usaa with perks that aren’t available through many other banks and insurance companies there are plenty of reasons to joinhowever usaa isn’t for everyone as only a handful of its products are available to nonmembers and though the company has flirted with expanding eligibility requirements in the past including a brief period when it welcomed employees of the fbi and other federal law enforcement agencies it appears likely to prioritize its core constituency – the military – for the foreseeable futureverdictusaa has a wide range of insurance and financial products available online it also offers support for members looking to save money on the purchase of a house car and various other services but with restrictive eligibility requirements it’s not an option for most americans and since you’re likely to do most of your business with usaa online it would be nice if they invested more in the website customer service and other aspects of the user experiencescore out of  stars for eligible members comprehensive offerings and lots of support for car home and servicebuyers are big pluses here poor website navigation and confusing customer service definitely hurthave you had any experiences with usaarelatedk views

mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and

commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit

financial services following general herres as ceo was robert g davis a former army officer who came to usaa with experience in a variety of financial services companies davis is said to have changed the culture at usaa during his time at usaa membership assets and net worth grew significantly and customer satisfaction declined precipitously his tenure however was not without controversy davis oversaw usaas first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership davis had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in

they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and

the organization was originally called the united states army automobile association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of

december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings

services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry

services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted

and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas

usaa was founded in  in san antonio texas by a group of  us army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employeescitation needed instead of agents contents  history

controversial leadership  oversight  falling service ratings  employment  see also  references  external links historyedit the organization was originally called the united states army automobile association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas

had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles

brokerage offers stock and mutual fund screeners interactive chart data detailed company information and summaries as well as interactive retirement and investment calculators though the firm have made significant gains to improve these tools in recent years overall we would rate their tools and resources as average to slightly belowaverage the stock and mutual fund screeners are simple to use but a little userunfriendly if trying to make quick modifications or corrections to the search criteria the interactive charts provide good information but lack the substance to gain a quick and concise understanding of the company or product being examined it seems all the right content is there for a user to use but the overall feel of the resources would be best described as slightly disorganized advanced trading platform unfortunately usaa investment services does not offer professional level trading platform which is available at many online brokers such as td ameritrade etrade

including a texas department of insurance regulated reciprocal interinsurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking investing and insurance to people and families that serve or served in the united states military at the end of  there were  million members usaa was founded in  in san antonio texas by a group of  us army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employeescitation needed instead of agents contents  history  lines of business  property casualty and life insurance  banking  investing and financial planning  target market  legal structure  returning profits to the insured  miscellaneous information  controversial leadership  oversight  falling service ratings  employment  see also  references  external links historyedit the organization was originally called the united states army automobile association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit usaas colorado springs location besides

as ceo was robert g davis a former army officer who came to usaa with experience in a variety of financial services companies davis is said to have changed the culture at usaa during his time at usaa membership assets and net worth grew significantly and customer satisfaction declined precipitously his tenure however was not without controversy davis oversaw usaas first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership davis had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles has stated that upon assuming the role of ceo i thought i was just going to be a temporary ceo and the board said guess what the permanent ceo is you on

army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct

automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit usaas colorado springs location besides its headquarters in san antonio usaa has a second major office in phoenix az and other

declined precipitously his tenure however was not without controversy davis oversaw usaas first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership davis had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles has stated that upon

of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started

nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance

federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit usaas colorado springs location besides its headquarters in san antonio usaa has a second major office in phoenix az and other
