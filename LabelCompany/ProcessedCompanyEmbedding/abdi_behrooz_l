chief financial officer thanks leslie ill start with comments on our q fiscal  performance and then ill turn it over to behrooz for his thoughts on the quarter and a strategic update finally ill conclude our prepared remarks with guidance for q most of my commentary on our income statement will refer to our nongaap presentation the balance sheet and cash flow data are presented and discussed in gaap format only there was a  per share aftertax difference between our gaap and nongaap operating results this quarter on a nongaap basis we earned  per share and on a gaap basis we posted a  loss the  difference consisted of the following  for a normal recurring reconciling items including removing stockbased compensation accreting interest on our convertible notes and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions from our gaap results  for a q charge related to a tentative patent cross license with one of our primary competitors and a  aftertax gaap credit as a result of reducing our estimated net earnout payments from the acquisitions of movea and tpi last year a complete reconciliation is attached to our release and available on our website total revenue for q was  million which represents a  sequential increase from last quarter and a  increase over the same quarter a year ago our q  versus q  revenue breakdown by market segment was as follows smartphones and tablets were  of total revenue in q up from  in q optical image stabilization was  in q versus  in q and all other segments including iot were  in q up from  in q there were three customers who individually accounted for more than  of our sales in q and those customers generated   and  of our q revenue there were two  plus customers in q and individually they contributed  and  of our q revenue geographically based on the headquarters of our end customers the q versus q revenue breakdown was as follows the us was  of revenue in q up from  in q korea was  in q down from  in q china was  this quarter up from  in q japan was  in q even with q taiwan was  in q down from  in q and the rest of world was  in q which is even with q in q our nongaap cost of revenue was  million resulting in a nongaap gross profit of  million or a  nongaap gross margin nongaap operating expenses for q were  million about even with what we spent in q research and development expenses were  million up about  from last quarter sga expenses were  million in q down from  million we posted last quarter our nongaap tax rate for q was  up slightly from the  we reported in q nongaap eps was  in q compared with  in q the average shares outstanding for q were  million compared with  million in q on the balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash and investments during q we generated about  million in cash flow from operations versus  million generated during q we spent about  million on capital investments in q dsos were  days in q versus  days in q net inventories decreased by  million since the end of q and inventory turnover based upon gaap cost of revenue was  turns this quarter versus  turns in q total head count increased by  during q and we ended the quarter with  employees we expect our head count to increase slightly during q now let me turn the call over to behrooz for his thoughts on the quarter and an update on our strategic initiatives behrooz behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you mark this was a solid quarter for us with both revenue and profits slightly higher than expected our performance reflected invensenses strong market position in our core motion products across the majority of mobile oems as well as the continued adoption of gyroenabled optical image stabilization or ois by major oems worldwide in addition we continue to gain traction with our new motion audio and software solutions building a design win portfolio that we expect will meaningfully contribute to revenues later this fiscal year our softwareenriched sensor platform is enabling innovative use cases across a number of vertical markets providing further validation of the soc strategy that we began implementing in  from a geographic perspective we continue to gain share in north america while extending our performance leadership positioning us to capture the majority of next generation platform in korea we continue to see adoption of ois for all major flagship smartphones resulting in more design wins and greater content opportunities for us going forward while oems in this region continue to aggressively drive cost reduction ois has the possibility to penetrate lower tier homes with additional revenue potential in china and other regions the smartphone market continues to evolve in our favor enhancing the value of our softwareenabled sensor platform the application processor market in china has become far more fragmented giving rise to a wide variety of solutions with the capabilities to process and manage sensor data at the same time chinese smartphone oems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their desire to use sensor technology as a means to differentiate their products taken together these drivers underscore the value of our sensor solution strategy and the use cases envisioned when we began investing in software nearly three years ago while we continue to drive raw sensor performance with our complete sensor framework we can manage much of the sensor calibration and fusion functions directly on our device this released the oems and the application processor suppliers of the task of buying or building a solution to accommodate their requirements and enabling faster time to market we are gaining exciting design win traction with our firefly product family a highly integrated three processor soc with our proprietary software arts  picture announced earlier this year firefly products allow customers to greatly reduce system power work space and cost while enabling complex multisensory data processing for applications such as optical and electronic image stabilization navigation and audio oems can also take advantage of the open platforms with an embedded arm core and sensor processor cores to differentiate their products with their own application algorithms our firefly solution is currently part of the tier  reference design in mobile and we are encouraged by its potential to drive adoption in china over the coming year were also excited about fireflys potential outside of mobile we expect to ramp a health and fitness wearable design in the next few quarters and we are gaining design traction in drones as well as strong interest in a variety of other nonmobile applications within the smartphone gaming industrial and automotive markets from a use case perspective image stabilization has continued to grow as a major driver for our revenue base customer diversification and competitive differentiation invensense has taken a significant competitive lead in optical image stabilization for mobile devices where adoption has increased yearonyear we believe ois adoption and attach rates will continue to increase in the future as oems worldwide leverage premium image quality as a key differentiating factor furthermore we believe this technology has horizontal applicability  across a number of verticals including drones automotive cameras security and other industrial applications invensense has also taken an early lead in electronic image stabilization or eis which reduces video jitter due to hand motion similar to ois eis provides a greatly enhanced user experience and another differentiating feature for oems today eis and ois are considered premium features that drive high sensor performance and integration but we are beginning to see these technologies designed into midrange products as well further we are actively developing unique capabilities to enable more mass market adoption for example oems are expressing interest in leveraging multiple ois enabled cameras for device for both standard imaging and video capabilities as well as advanced d photography some oems may choose to have multiple discrete modules while others are expressing interest in accomplishing certain ois functionality through software and algorithms that run on the mainboard axis motiontracking device we are uniquely positioned to provide these capabilities today through our recently announced m series axis soc that includes image stabilization hardware and algorithms it greatly simplifies the software development requirements for our oem customers and provides a premium imaging experience for the end user this industry leading device also includes alwayson activity classification device context gesture detection pedometer functionality runtime calibration and axis axis and axis sensor fusion the value added capabilities of the m family increase the stickiness of our design wins and allows to have a more strategic and collaborative relationship with our customers following the image stabilization navigation and context are the next most common use cases driving sensor adoption and performance one challenge with existing location technologies such as gnss is that on their own they cannot provide full uninterrupted coverage in urban canyons parking structures and indoor locations they also consume too much battery power to be always on our sensor assisted positioning technology addresses these challenges by providing and intelligently processing the flow of motion sensor data for precise navigation experience substantially eliminating the location drift that often occurs with gps alone the invensense positioning library can uniquely fuse multiple location technologies to offer accurate alwayson position when paired with our axis axis or axis motiontracking socs we are currently shipping the invensense positioning library to a major smartphone oem and are in software trials at several global brands similar to the manner in which ois market developed our first initial navigation design traction is coming from mobile but we are also seeing active interest from a highly diverse customer set outside of mobile including wearables drones automotive and industrial verticals as well as application layer customers looking to license this product as a standalone software suite turning to audio with the release earlier this year of our newest suite of microphone and related products invensense has taken a leading position in highend analog audio performance these small footprint low power and high fidelity devices are allowing us to win designs in applications such as smart home and business communications where performance is the leading factor in our selection as well as in wearable devices where size is a critical design consideration we expect to see revenue from these applications and others by the end of our fiscal year while the mobile market still lags behind other verticals in its requirement for highend audio performance we do believe that sound quality particularly for video will eventually become a competitive differentiator in the same way that ois has become a differentiator for image quality were likely to see our first design wins from tier  and tier  oems creating a new standard for consumer expectations further we are at the forefront of the market disruption from digital mems microphones which is likely to occur over the next several years digital audio will enable a whole new array of alwayson smart microphone capabilities across numerous applications unlike analog audio which must be converted to a digital signal inside a codec before being passed on to a core processor a digital audio signal can be directly accessed and fused with other sensor data and managed under sensor platform allowing the microphone to remain continuously active for voice commands and contextual awareness we announced our first family of digital microphones earlier this year and are seeing early interest at a number of mobile oems as well as design win success in wearable applications taken in total imaging navigation and audio provides significant use cases for the continued proliferation of sensor technology in both mobile and nonmobile applications invensense uniquely offers a complete sensor platform to process manage and fuse the data for greater sensor intelligence and ease of use for our customers we are excited to see this platform strategy coming to bear with early success from major smartphone oems in china and we believe that customers across a number of vertical markets and applications will derive significant value from our robust capabilities looking forward were excited about our future opportunities while we have built up our financial strength and scale we also have built the strongest portfolio of solutions in our companys history we are seeing the market evolve towards the adoption of new use cases and improved features which in turn drive higher performance and integration and play well into our strength these include image stabilization navigation and alwayson audio that are optimized through tight integration of hardware and software capabilities these use cases are in demand across a number of vertical markets providing us with great opportunity to reach beyond mobile in the coming years in the near term were maintaining a strong market position with our core axis products and are enjoying the increasing demand for our ois solutions we expect that our new motion and audio products to begin contributing to revenue during this fiscal year providing incremental growth opportunity diversification and margin benefits in the quarters to come with that ill turn the call back to mark for guidance for the second fiscal quarter of  mark mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer thank you behrooz for q fiscal  we are estimating that total revenue will be within a range of  million to  million our expectations for nongaap gross margins in q is a range between  and  nongaap operating expenses are expected to increase slightly in q our nongaap net other expense and our tax rate should be about flat with q nongaap eps should be within a range of  to  per share assuming an average share count of about  million if you are modeling us on a gaap basis our gross margins should be between  and  and gaap eps should be between a  loss and a  gain in q this concludes our prepared remarks and now ill turn the call back over to our operator whitley for your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of cody acree with ascendiant capital please proceed cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc thanks guys for taking my questions looks like maybe guidance was a little lighter than expected behrooz could you maybe talk about what youre seeing particularly in china are you dealing with some of the same excess of inventory that some of the other oems are or other component vendors are mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi cody this is mark a couple of things about q it was a little bit short of what the midpoint was for the consensus as we entered the earning season that is true we are a little concerned with the macro issues that we are hearing about some of it is china growth and some of the consumer sentiment coming out of the united states so were trying to factor that into the overall guidance that wed put together id still point out that even with that having been said it is still a  plus yearoveryear increase in the top line and we also can see margin leverage coming throughout this year when we pencil out the whole year so while it is a little bit light relative to what we were thinking probably three months ago i do think overall it still represents a pretty sound and solid growth story cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc and mark are you dealing with excess of inventory or do you think its simply an issue of maybe waning demand and given your gross margin guidance it looks like maybe your mix is shifting towards some of the larger oems is that a correct read mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer thats a pretty fair read overall right now where our senses is that our yields are stabilizing the pricing environment seems about static with what weve experienced in the last couple of quarters but we do have to factor into the account that we – that our success with large customers on one hand also comes with a price and that is that they do get volume discounts and thats certainly a factor creeping into the guidance cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc and then just lastly with whats going on in china i guess how much visibility do you really have some oem or some component vendors have characterized theres a few weeks of inventory do you get a sense for whats the runway youve got to deal with before maybe you get back to some normalization mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer well we have decent visibility into the quarter in the sense that i would describe it as probably eight weeks so as we enter the quarter we have pretty good visibility into the first couple of months the third month obviously weve taken order and process it and thats obviously where we are a little bit more vulnerable to changes in demand so i would say our visibility is pretty good there is nothing indicating that there are major macro problems coming out of china yet but were trying to be cautious about how strong the consumer sentiment is going to be there cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc okay great thank you guys behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt ramsay with canaccord genuity please proceed matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc good afternoon gentlemen thank you very much behrooz maybe you could talk a little bit about with respect to the guidance that you are thinking about seasonal characteristics of some of your big customers seeing any difference than they were last year obviously you guys have won business yearoveryear with the major new customers so the growth rate on a yearoverbasis q to q are quite different and is there anything that you are thinking about from a launch cadence of major platforms that might be different or share shifts around to explain that in addition to just what  cody asked about in china thanks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah with regards to new customers quite frankly in north america the share continues to increase last year we were growing in all the platforms some of the legacy platforms we were in obviously this year is a little bit different so our share in north america has gone up in terms of the seasonality of the market award the  product launches and all that obviously i cant comment to any particular platforms or customers other than we dont see a marked difference versus last year and then i think really its mostly a lot of the sentiments that you hear around the guidance is mostly around the macro i mean there is share shift within the customers there is movement within the customers but its mostly around the macro and were just trying to adjust our sentiment with the whole macro consumer right now and as we get more visibility hopefully well be in a better shape to answer that question little bit – with more clarity mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah i might add just a little color to that in the sense that if there is – the one area that is a little less certain right now is mobile and right now the concern in our mobile distribution is that that may not continue with the growth rate that we had seen previously the other aspects of the business i think the dois  story continues to be pretty strong and i also think that as we move to the middle of the year youre going to see more contribution from other markets as we spread our wings a little bit but if mobile continues strong and were looking at  unit growth yearoveryear well be fine but if that takes a headwind thats still  of the picture and we have to take that into account matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc understood thanks for the color there mark as a follow up maybe you could expand a little bit about the ip crosslicensing agreement that you mentioned in the prepared remarks and i guess the financial terms of that and any details that you could provide there would be really helpful thanks mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i have good news and bad news there i cant share everything that id like to share about it yet we have not formally consummated the arrangement but we are further – far enough down the line where we were able to set up the accrual in q and just a couple of additional pieces of data it is a broad patent crosslicense it is with a significant competitor we have been in discussion for a while with the counterparty the arrangement is not yet complete but its far enough along where we were able to release some information about it this quarter the details will remain confidential but well get a market update when we do formalize it and we recorded in the quarter a gaaponly charge of about  million there will be little impact to the financials going forward as most of the financial impact was again reflected in the  million so unfortunately its probably about as far as i can go today with what we know and to honor the process of getting to a final agreement matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc all right thanks guys fair enough ill jump back in the queue behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director okay operator your next question comes from the line of ruben roy with piper jaffray please proceed ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker thank you behrooz you talked about some of your new product areas and expansion of technology software et cetera relative to longerterm stickiness of design wins can you characterize design activity relative to your large customers and some of these new technology offerings that you bring to the table versus i guess what i would call emerging market customers are you seeing more initial interest and activity in emerging markets or are the large customers also signing on to some of these areas behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah for the most part as weve always said when it comes to software and products such as firefly for example where you have more of the soc it applies mostly to the emerging markets who want to compete against the larger oems the larger oems what they want is raw performance for the most part again within that there is different categories so what weve done is over the last couple years weve continued to push the performance bar on the gyro and accelerometer and every part that we do it has better performance lower size lower power and that satisfies the larger oem so in that case where really the focus remains on raw performance both on the motion and on audio with the new products so we do have a goal of gaining more content with the tier  with the bigger oems through just mostly hardware on the emerging market its really a continuum its a range in terms of anything from just software that runs on their processors to us offloading all the processing into our chip and taken on use cases such as ois eis and taking care of all that processing inside a chip like a firefly so thats the continuum but its really the software part of its more targeted towards the emerging markets – and other markets outside of mobile wearables drones things like that ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker great thats helpful and i just had a followup for mark mark you mentioned that you expect to see some margin leverage coming throughout the rest of the year what are the moving parts behind that do you think gross margins come back up to sort of the mids area that youre kind of targeting or is this a combination of that and maybe lower opex growth mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah actually i think that the gross margins – i dont think that theyre going to increase materially from here our guide for next quarter is right around mids but we are slightly on the low side so i understand the nuance there and i think we are here in this position for the next couple of quarters and then i think towards the end of the year if all the tea leaves come to bear with the new products coming in and us coming up to speed with the new product yields and so on and so forth i think theres a chance for some slight leverage coming out of q of this year so i think the gross margin profile is going to be midish this year starting out a little bit higher than that maybe slightly below the mid point during the middle of the year and then hopefully creeping back towards the mids at the end of the year i think on the operating expense side were fairly fully invested right now and although i mentioned in my comments that we do expect some slight head count growth increase we think the operating expense profile that we experienced in q will be with us for the rest of the year maybe a slight very slight quartertoquarter increase but we definitely believe that weve got the resources in place to fulfill the product road maps to get the customer sampling done and actually set us up for an aggressive growth  but at this point were also being cautious on the spending side just because we want to hedge the macro circumstance all of that comes to pass we will get pl leverage out of the growth this year ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker very helpful thank you mark mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of suji de silva with topeka please proceed suji de silva  topeka capital markets hi behrooz hi mark you talked in the prepared remarks about moving some of the premium smartphone into the mainstream can you elaborate on that and how soon you think that happens and what the asp and gross margin impact of that penetration would be behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah this was mostly related to the image stabilization functions like eis and ois eis well probably youre going to see it sooner because it does not require a more sophisticated camera module you dont need the moving lens and all the mechanics that go around it ois will be a little bit further behind it requires more heavy lifting both on the hardware as well as the software but we are seeing quite a bit of traction with that and the reason for that suji is that quite frankly even the smartphone even at the highend theyre driving the imaging as a key differentiator but when you go to the midtier its really getting harder and harder for the oems to differentiate the one or two things that we see thats coming up thats very significant is image quality camera quality and we are starting to see a very very strong pull for that from the oems so in the midtier i would expect that well start seeing some features creep into this in the second half of the year in terms of design wins and then ois i think the design wins into the midtier probably by the end of the year and then revenue more significant revenue through next year suji de silva  topeka capital markets great thats helpful and then also in the prepared remarks you discussed the korean customers pretty well above the size  focusing on cost reductions what does that – what impact does that have on you in terms of  how you try to meet their requirements to try and reduce costs behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director obviously we go through the normal pricing negotiations that weve always done but really the impact is that they are going to more heavily drive multisourcing and we have seen that weve always said that theyve always wanted to multisource their platforms where performance matters and they dont have a choice and i think were really well positioned there sockets like ois we have a bit stronger position and then there is platforms quite frankly that its all about cost and gyros just a checkmark and we are going to be more disciplined about going after those sockets because the only thing they care about is pricing and we are going to be moving away from some of those sockets quite frankly suji de silva  topeka capital markets great helpful color behrooz thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird please proceed tristan gerra  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good afternoon in the past youve talked about some cost reduced versions of your gyroscopes is there one coming up and i apologize if i missed the commentary on the call and if not is it fair to assume that your gross margin notably  your largest customer could erode as youre entering the second year of design win and basically you potentially have the same cost structure with eroding pricing behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well there is a number of knobs as you noticed into the margin one is on the pricing and then the other one is of course on the cost structure on the pricing i feel that what were seeing – were actually seeing an interesting trend in market with some of the tier s driving performance and as they drive performance and we believe that we have a lead on the performance we believe that pricing pressure in those sockets is not as prevalent as some of the other sockets so i think in terms of pricing in some cases may not be in some sockets may not erode as much as the other one so there is some pricing leverage as we go into next generation of products more importantly on the cost structure we havent announced any cost reduced or gyros or next generation gyros yet but i can tell you that the technology doesnt stop so there is definitely activity thats going on we just havent announced anything and havent prepared anything for an announcement or release to the market yet but there is definitely activity on the cost reduction so in terms of margin erosion obviously we are taking steps in both of those directions in terms of performance increase and cost reduction tristan gerra  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then in terms of the axis is that still relevant are you seeing still interest in terms of customers wanting to integrate the pressure sensor or is that a market that is really staying as a niche and what is the demand overall for pressure sensor in smartphones behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thats a really good question it has been a niche there are some phones that actually have that and the use cases havent come into bear yet we believe that significant use case will be around navigation and context and context is nice to have but navigation at some point may even become mandatory indoor navigation for things like e  so from a technology standpoint we continue to drive it today we have design in activity outside of mobile in some other verticals with our axis in mobile most likely well start with tier  tier s and again will be bundled with our navigation software but i think that the time hasnt come yet but it will be here in the next couple of years but we definitely continue to drive the technology tristan gerra  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then last quick one inspite of your guidance could you provide some read as to the sequential change for your smartphone versus the ois business mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer you mean as we look forward we typically dont guide that but i will give you some just directional feel i would expect going forward that the ois business will continue to be strong i suspect that as a contribution of our total revenue the mobile market will decrease a little bit and i think youre going to start to see increasing contribution from some of the other markets that weve talked about tristan gerra  robert w baird  co inc broker great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ted moreau with barrington research please proceed theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc well thank you very much i was wondering if your visibility today is the same as at this point a quarter ago when you guided for fiscal q did you see eight weeks of visibility mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer i would say our visibility today ted is a little less clear than it was at the same point that we guided when we talked to you  days ago theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay and so that would be more of a standard what you saw going into this current quarter will be more of a standard what you typically see then mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah its a little hard to see i havent  been here that long but i would say its a little bit less than what weve seen in the last two quarters or three quarters i think thats fair theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay and can you share if possible what the potential margin trajectory could be on the cross patent agreement and any upstreams related to those or is it way too early to figure that all mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah its pretty early to figure that out all i would say is that the nearterm effects are probably going to be very will be nil the margin visibility that we have right now is confined basically to the next quarter and so to the rest of this year and what the impact of the patent cross license hard to tell at this point we do think its going to free us up and enable us to proceed into some new horizons but more to come on that theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay fair enough thank you so much ill pass the line operator your next question comes from the line of mark delaney with goldman sachs please proceed mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co yes good afternoon and thanks so much for taking the questions i was hoping first if we could get a little bit more of an update on seasonality for the second half of the fiscal year and historically the december quarter on a quarteronquarter basis its been theres been a wide range but the median and averages both on the top line up slightly mark you already talked about if i heard correctly gross margin comes down potentially in the december quarter so maybe you can just help us understand what sort of top line trajectory you have in mind and how you think at this point revenue may compare to seasonality mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah mark i didnt – let me try to clarify my statements what i think is that the gross margin profile that we sort of guided for q will probably replicate itself in q dont write that down on stone because theres a lot of variables that happen between now and when we get there but i think that the margin profile i dont think gets appreciably better nor do i think it will get appreciably worse well update you in  days on that with respect to the revenue profile a lot would obviously have to do with the consumer pool around the holiday season our december quarter would obviously factor some of that in but again were little too far away yet to see what kind of a pool were going to get on that mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and then so im going to  followup into the prior comments on market share in korea maybe you can just give us a sense of the magnitude what sort of market share do you think you have in the mobile space in korea say over the last  months and then how does that compare on over the next  upcoming product cycles over the next year behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well in aggregate if you take axis and ois together across all the customers in korea i would venture to say were in the upper s perhaps if not higher i think going forward with the visibility that we have well probably – again in aggregate between the two depending on the platform i would say from the visibility that we have we could go as low as  to  mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co okay and then just one last one from me on the audio side behrooz i think you commented on expecting to see revenue first with tier  and tier  mobile customers my interpretation at ces was that the audio products that were being introduced were higher performance products and i thought there was maybe an opportunity to being to qualify those at larger oems so maybe you can just give us an update on the competitive positioning in audio and what some of the reasons are that the opportunities with some of these smaller handset customers to begin with behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well if you look at just like motion typically what the tier  and tier s want to do is differentiate with the tier s and they cant really do it as much with scale so what they do is they differentiate on performance ois emerged mostly out of the tier s and it took a while before the tier s adopted it so its not to say that we are not – we dont see tier s as opportunities we are seeing this we are actively going in there were working with the tier s on the microphone just looking at the probability we obviously go across all the markets and all the customers but if you look at where we get the most pool depending on the customer in some cases when it comes to really high performance analog we typically are getting it out of tier  tier s tier s the first thing on their mind today is not just cost but also performance and some of the criteria but really supply chain and microphone we are a new player in microphone so again just like motion we are proving ourself out and we are showing that we can manufacture these units in tens of millions if not higher and were showing the performance and all thats coming together in next two quarters but we are definitely going after tier s and we do see them as an opportunity i just wanted to kind of cover  the probability of where the first design wins will come from mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of jagadish iyer of redstone please proceed jagadish iyer  redstone technology research yeah thanks for taking my question two questions mark so first thing is that how should we think about ois growth going forward if my math is right it is somewhat stagnated for the last two quarters to three quarters so i just wanted to get some sense of the directionality of the ois and then i have a followup mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah well we had previously seen – of course its come up so quickly in the last six quarters or seven quarters that its a little hard to do pattern deciphering right now but we had initially  strong and it even caught us off guard q on ois it was  contribution to revenue what we said entering this year was is that we would be we were expecting that we could actually get to  contribution from ois by the time we got to the end of this fiscal year and if you just pattern out maybe a  point average improvement over the course of the year we could start out in the low teens and wind up at  that way thats still probably the most plausible outcome from all of this its just that when you book  in q you got a tough compare and with  theres nothing to be ashamed of coming out of q i suspect its our coming out of q i also think that its likely to be right around that range for the next quarter in q and then i think as the year finishes up theres a good chance that itll strengthen so thats the high level look and bear in mind a big order a big shipment near the end of the quarter can skew any particular quarter and i would caution you to intend to look at this over maybe a day period than every  days on the directional theres nothing i hope that nothing is  coming out of the call  on ois jagadish iyer  redstone technology research okay fair enough and also i just wanted to get a sense of the pricing trend that youre seeing on the ois so far mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah well like pricing trends prices always is a general rule once you get a product out and release there is always some downward pressure on pricing thats just the nature of the consumer markets obviously the downward trend in ois is considerably less steep than it is on our general motion products because frankly theres less competition where its not a one horse race but were differentiated enough that we can hold our ground there better so to the extent that thats strong thats obviously good news for our margins jagadish iyer  redstone technology research okay and just one just a quick followup how should we think about revenues from the korea region for the second half of this year for you thank you mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer if we had to make a call today based upon the commentary that behrooz in his response in the prior question i think that as a percentage contribution to the total business they will be down probably in q and for the second half of the year but there is some chance that we will qualify into new slots towards the end of the year and we could turn that trend around but we knew the day was probably coming when we were not going to carry  market share forever and weve had a very very good run we were differentiated but pricing pressure in certain stages of the phones introduces competition and the reality is is that there is some business that we just arent going to chase and as a result weve got to be careful – as a result were anticipating that were going to be lighter than we have been in the last few quarters jagadish iyer  redstone technology research thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of tom sepenzis with northland capital markets please proceed tom sepenzis  northland capital markets hi thanks for taking my questions i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the cross licensing and whether that in any way makes it easier for your competitor to compete with you in the mobile market specifically mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah tom unfortunately im going to have to raise my hand on that that we can only say so much at this point because the arrangement is preliminary and i do think we probably said as much as we can say on that at least at this point tom sepenzis  northland capital markets okay great and then in terms of ois up until now youve been pretty much the only one in the market in china are you – is that still the case or are you seeing competition now and if so is it from your largest competitor or is it from smaller chinese competition behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director if it comes in it will be from the larger guys but weve always had them – weve always seen them in the market they really never got to the qualifications and mostly because of the performance size and all the other parameters that drive this particular market that dynamic hasnt changed so yes we do hear about them in the market we always have question is will they be able to get to where they need to they can get qualified and quite frankly become a real competitor in this market we just havent seen that yet tom sepenzis  northland capital markets okay great and then lastly just in terms of eis versus ois is that still leveraging your axis gyro or how is that market being addressed behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thats actually just driving – using the mainboard axis along with some software and some of the other hardware that we put into the chip there is a lot of new features that are coming in and that doesnt require specific hardware in the module and eis will just take advantage of the axis so that you can use the run of the mill camera module that youre using today but with some hardware and software built into the gyro into the axis you can enable eis and thats what weve been developing over the last couple of quarters or last year tom sepenzis  northland capital markets do you get a bump in price for that or is that just behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director oh absolutely i mean no – absolutely if you look at the axis motiontracking device quite frankly one of the things that a lot of customers – and this is what drives some of the pricing discussion and cost discussion – people have always beyond gaming and some features in imaging some rudimentary features in imaging a lot of people in the past have struggled around gyro adoption at the oems and we think that what were seeing now is that as they try to drive more – better quality cameras really they dont have a choice but to use gyros so as long as camera differentiation and camera becomes a differentiator in your phone you have to now adopt gyro and not only that you have to adopt high performance gyro and with the features that only we offer today so were pretty bullish on the imaging we have really pinpointed the strongest use case that drives axis in eis and longer term again continues to drive ois so were pretty bullish on that use case and its something that weve been developing ip around for the last year both on the hardware and the software and that definitely has value that we intend to capture tom sepenzis  northland capital markets okay thank you very much behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of richard shannon with craighallum please proceed richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions probably just a couple from me mark i think you mentioned that there is certain sockets youre not going to be addressing due to pricing i wonder if you can characterize the geographical customer base where youre seeing this happen and is this a result of your larger competitors that are based in europe that have the currency advantage or are they coming from elsewhere mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer well they can come from anywhere but weve tried to be candid about the reality is is that we need to price protect for the value that were bringing in the form of our performance differentiation and what that does mean is that the discipline to say is is that there is a point in which you have to walk away and of course if you eliminate performance you boil everything down to price and we have stated that our strategy if you look at our product portfolio is definitely to stay into the high performance area and i would say no you could point out that with respect to our commentary about korea that that is a factor and i believe it is a factor but its not isolated to there this has been a philosophy of the company certainly since ive been here and will continue to be and what that means is is that there may be periods of time in which we can hold  share in a competitive selling situation but its hard to hold on to that forever especially in a very very competitive market behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director and by the way just to add a little bit color on that this is again this is nothing new in china we have in the past weve had oems that for the last two years three years every time we go in to their lobby quite frankly they push back and theyve asked us for you got to be pincompatible with the other two guys and you got to be lower cost and we never did that until we got to a point where they needed a certain performance and quite frankly there was nobody else and we were able to get into these oems with the performance for the use case that they had and i wont go into the particular use case but situations where its driven by certain use case in our case were driving use cases like imaging navigation and so on we believe that that gives us a significant lead and we dont have to go and weaken our baseline to get those sockets and thats – so its not limited to korea weve had this issue and challenge always in china where we have the big ibms and its not as much tied to the currency as its to the fundamental business model that they have a fab – they have fabs that they have to fill so they can always justify taking very low gross margin business to fill the fab and thats just not how we operate richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc all right okay i appreciate all those comments thats very helpful maybe one or two quick questions from me couple of questions and some comments on eis historically the eis has only been used by one mobile guy in the past year im assuming thats something you expect to pushing and marketing towards across the entire mobile landscape is that accurate behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thats accurate in fact we started pushing eis and ois long before we knew that certain oem or oems would start driving at certain architecture or certain way we felt that  that unless you have a very strong use case its really going to be hard to drive these sensors and imaging has always been one of the areas that we felt very strongly about that eventually will become a strong use case and we are seeing that and in different shapes and forms thats why the chips that we have today the socs that we have from axis to main axis to socs that has multiple cores in it weve developed a software architecture that really takes advantage of imaging and image stabilization as a key feature going forward thats an ip set of ips that we started developing over the last year and then with that – then we felt that the next use case will eventually become better navigation outdoors and then indoors and then audio so we feel the same way about audio thats why we try to not dilute ourselves and go into the market with after socket thats commodity i mean if you look at audio for example its a  billion unit market and were starting from the very top developing use cases around areas that we believe that we can have a differentiation and value and same thing with the energy richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay great i appreciate those comments as well behrooz mark quick question for you on inventory how do you expect the inventory to finish in the current quarter will that be up or down or kind of flat how do you see that mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer if i had to call right now id say itd probably be about flat richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay perfect thanks guys behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of  please proceed unknown speaker hi thanks very much for taking my question just a question on cash you build it up quite nicely over the last three quarters to a healthy or healthier  million net cash position i mean youre generating better free cash flow at the moment just wondering if there is any plan for the cash flow you building it up and if there is a plan kind of what ma scenarios could you look up  or i mean is there anything that youre looking to bolt on to your business thanks and i have a follow up mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer good question  youre going to have to forgive me for being a little circumspect on your second one about ma activity but at least let me talk about the first yeah we have paid attention to our free cash flow generation and try to make it a priority particularly coming out of year ago we bought we invested in two software companies that chewed up the capital and we actually were net negative with respect to our net cash position and we built that up it has grown nicely and itll continue to be an area of emphasis theres no plans being contemplated right now to do any sort of return to cash to shareholders if thats what youre asking so really were just building it up dry powder we are obviously aware of the market conditions that the semi industry is consolidating as a whole and we are canvassing always for possibilities out there i would say our target right now would have to have a fairly high threshold for us to activate on it just because weve got plenty of internal plans that are going along very very well and we built up our resources in the last year but id never rule it out completely and frankly having the cash around gives us more flexibility to be able to do something quickly if an opportunity presents itself and behrooz ill let you behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah let me just add a little bit more comment mark its absolutely correct in terms of the mas weve always looked at mas and ive always looked at it as what do you need to fill on your roadmap or if theres something that opportunistic comes along that you absolutely need to take on in the last couple of years i just felt very strongly that we wanted to transition the company from just a component company to become a platform around sensors not just for mobile but for other markets and that required us to have software resources and software resources around certain use cases and certain features and that came together along with movea as well as and tpi and of course adi microphone we were developing our own microphone but it was a combination of where we felt that we were developing products that we had to get scale and technology and the opportunities that came along i believe like as mark said today i feel very good about our financial stability we have plenty of cash and i feel good that we are in a position if something comes along we can take action but quite frankly were not shopping we are very focused we feel that we have the skill to develop what we need to do and we got a lot of work already on our plate and with resources that we have so i feel very good about that unknown speaker okay thats great and when i look at your next generation platforms of your american customer what do you  expect next quarter in terms of products and how that compares to the previous generation product that was in the previous generation models and how should i think about if it is new products how does launching something like that for the first time how do we think about yields and new processes and with downside risks to gross margin from launching such a high volume ramp behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director you have to forgive me if im  extremely high level on this one but it really is no different than the semiconductor evolution a better part in terms of performance and its that evolution obviously every part has to be better in terms of performance and i wont get into any kind of performance criteria and what is better and all that we do feel that we also have a little bit better learning than we did last year in terms of the customer dynamics and in terms of where the knobs are in terms of manufacturing so i wouldnt say that we have everything figured out but i do believe that were in a stronger position to predict yield and manufacturability versus where we were last year so im going to have to keep it at that high level  unknown speaker okay mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer and given that behrooz is keeping at high level i think i can echo his thought unknown speaker thanks everyone and the final thing is on ois and eis can you just firstly to say how much of the highend market smartphone market currently has already adopted ois or eis and also the impact of the market moving to using ois on the main axis versus discrete the asp bump that youd get versus losing potentially discrete axis ois  and maybe as i understand that i dont think you shipped any eis as of today but i mean by yearend im just wondering what kind of proportion of your image stabilization shipments could we be expecting to be eis as a whole thanks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director sure sure its probably going to take a longer dialogue than when you have time but let me try and capture as much as i can here with eis its a trend that the interest has always been there on the oems to obviously what it gives them is without having to go and make drastic changes on the form factor which in some cases you have to consider for ois because you have to get a different camera module in this case you basically go into existing product and you replace the existing axis with a different type of axis that we have with certain hardware features and software features that we have incorporated so in terms of the ease of adoption there is some work there is heavy lifting mostly on the software but for oems its a more acceptable faster time to market so we expect to see some customer design ins at least a few less than half a dozen less than a handful of design wins this year probably one or two ramping late this year maybe but  unknown speaker fiscal year sorry is that fiscal year or currently  youre talking behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director fiscal year unknown speaker okay behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director so we see that certainly on the eis and we will get a bump on the asp and on the ois i think theres a little more heavy lifting because we are disrupting the architecture and using the main axis and even then quite frankly i dont think we negate the need for dual access because i think theres always going to be different tiers of performance if you are a photographer youre always thinking in terms of aperture fstop things like that so if you look at it from that angle theres always going to be a need and theres always going to be customers that are going for driving for very high performance to access what we wanted to do was have the capability to offer axis ois eis combination with asp uplift and stickiness on the mainboard and architecturally so again i apologize theres a lot of architectural changes here that im talking about im trying to capture in a very short conversation but we dont necessarily see it in short i dont necessarily see it as cannibalization of a business i see it more of a strengthening of core axis plus additional opportunity again one comment i dont know if you caught it in the script people are looking at multiple cameras and we believe that camera in general is just at the early stages of being a main differentiator in a lot of these phones so were actually very bullish about imaging unknown speaker okay thats very helpful thank you very much behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of krishna shankar with roth capital please proceed krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc yes given your manufacturing improvements and your sort of cost roadmap with your large us or korean customers do you feel that longer term gross margins can sort of lift out of this current range to a higher plateau or whats kind of your longer term outlook for gross margins given the tradeoff between improved manufacturing efficiencies and the cost reductions you have to give to customers behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well let me start with the ceo response and then ill let mark bring me back to ground here the short answer is yes again there is no moores law in mems what there is is and were – as i mentioned the question that tristan asked earlier we do see a trend at least in some of the more sophisticated customer engineering and customer base towards higher performance and to the degree that we can differentiate ourselves on high performance we believe that there is value there in both performance and integration so thats the trend that were driving at the same time as much as there is moores law there is still architecturally ways to reduce cost and we believe that we have at least couple more architectural things that we got to do architectural nodes that we have in front of us to reduce cost over the next couple of years so i think that mems is very similar to where rf and analog was  years  years ago where you didnt necessarily get cost reduction and integration through moores law but you got it in the third dimension and we see the same thing with mems so short answer is yes i definitely believe that there is a path in terms of margin improvement but im going to – but just like anything else it takes a lot of hard work and it takes time and were on that path mark dentinger  vice president and chief financial officer yeah krishna this is mark couple of other thoughts just to add to what behrooz said is i do believe that we actually do have very good signals that we will get margin improvement either towards the end of this year or as we turn the corner into our fiscal  i say that because obviously with respect to q weve already digested the incurred cost in the profile of our overhead that is going to pass into the pl in q so we have some visibility to that and we also have some visibility based upon the business that we think were going to do in q as to how the margin should profile out in q i do think that thats probably were passing through maybe the tightest period of time here ill never say never because it can only dip down a little bit more from here i dont think it will be a meaningful lock step down but i do think were sort of passing through these periods of times and i would chalk up one factor that gives me confidence that were probably headed out of this which is that we grew the company so fast in the last two years twoandahalf years that we learned a lot about how to – the discipline of introducing multiple products into the marketplace at the same time and scaling up and turning quickly on the dime against changes in demand and i believe that thats going to pay some dividends in the form of slightly tighter processes as we move forward behrooz is right there are some architectural things that are also going to come our way i dont want to piece it out too much but i think if we can be patient for the next couple of quarters im hopeful that were going to see some meaningful improvement that we can share with you krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc thats great and on a related note behrooz what about the revenue opportunity in new markets like wearables smart tv remote controls iot gaming drones perhaps can you talk about those new opportunities and when could we see material revenues there behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director i could talk about it briefly you saw some indications in the numbers as to what we call iot we used to call it other but it really has formulated itself into iot which is anything with sensors thats connected to the internet which is just about everything from drones to wearables actually were feeling very encouraged in that trend we havent talked about it much in the past because the numbers were meaningless compared to mobile but they are becoming more interesting so if you give us some time in the next quarter im hoping that we can share some more information on that with you but were feeling very very encouraged with that krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc okay thank you operator that concludes our qa ill now turn the call over to back behrooz abdi president and ceo please proceed behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well thank you everyone for participating

removing stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated net charges from gaap earnings a complete reconciliation is attached to our release and available on our website our q performance largely fell within the guidance range we issued at the beginning of the quarter with a strong contribution from our largest customers pushing us slightly over the top end of our revenue guidance and our costs and expenses generally falling in line with our expectations total revenue for q was  million which represents a  sequential decrease from last quarter and a  increase over the same quarter a year ago our q versus q revenue breakdown by market segment was as follows smartphones and tablets were  of total revenue in q down from  in q optical image stabilization was  in q up from  in q and all other market segments including gaming were  in q up from  in q revenue from customers who individually made up more than  of our sales in q was  with our largest and second largest customers accounting for  and  respectively the same customers made up  and  of our revenue in q geographically based on the headquarters of our customers the q versus q revenue breakdown was as follows korea was  in q up from  in q the us was  in q down from  in q china was  this quarter up from  in q japan was  in q even with q taiwan was  in q up from  in q and the rest of the world was  in q versus  in q nongaap cost of revenue was  million in q resulting in nongaap gross profit of  million or a  nongaap gross margin nongaap operating expenses for q were  million up about  million from q research and development expenses were  million up from  million in q sga expenses were  million in q up from about  million we posted last quarter our nongaap tax rate for q was  down slightly from the  rate in q nongaap eps was  in q compared with  in q and  in q of last year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for q were  million compared with  million in q from the balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash and investments during q we generated about  million in cash flow from operations versus the  million generated during q we spent about  million in capital investments in q operating cash flow in q benefited from a day improvement in dso versus our december quarter the q dso improvement mostly resulted from renegotiating some of our distributor agreements to collect trade receivables faster so this improvement is unlikely to repeat in q we expect that dsos will remain in the midtohigh day range for the near future net inventories increased by about  million since the end of q our expectation is that net inventories will remain about flat in q total head count increased by  during q and we ended the quarter with  employees we expect our head count to increase slightly during q finally id like to add a few thoughts on fiscal  while we grew substantially in  we also invested aggressively in securing new customer wins ramping our manufacturing capabilities and introducing new products both organically and through acquisitions as we enter fiscal  our view is that we have most of the resources in place to continue to grow and our expectation is that improved operating expense leverage will translate into earnings improvement now let me turn the call over to behrooz for his thoughts on the quarter and an update on our strategic initiatives behrooz behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you mark fiscal  was a significant year for invensense we posted the highest revenue in company history driven by strong market share gains and several new highvolume customer wins we also had healthy growth in strategic emerging markets such as china where our sales increased by more than  from the previous fiscal year we demonstrated that we could ramp our business to support a dramatic increase in demand for our products thus validating our fabless business model across highvolume mobile customers and as such the company reached a new level of scale that empowers our team to drive a compelling technology and product roadmap in addition to increasing revenue market share and market diversity in fiscal  we also started to see earning validation of our strategy of investing in hardware and software integration around compelling new sensorbased features during fiscal  we completed two highly strategic software acquisitions that underscore and advance our vision to provide a softwareenriched sensor platform the assets and talent of these teams combined with rich algorithmic and development capabilities weve grown organically are already making meaningful contributions we also brought to market a record number of new products across our motion sensor software and microphone portfolios with each successive new product generation we are raising the industry bar on performance power efficiency and sensor intelligence and increasing competitive barriers to entry for example in march we announced the new m series axis soc that includes a sophisticated suite of software and algorithms for alwayson activity classification device context gesture detection pedometer functionality run time calibration and axis and axis sensor fusion this device also features improved image stabilization hardware and algorithms reducing the software complexity for the oem and generating a better imaging experience for the end user by providing these capabilities on a single chip we enable our customers to come to market more quickly with products that offer the advanced feature sets end users desire were also driving towards improved stickiness in our design wins as well as greater competitive differentiation between our solutions and those that take a more traditional component approach in march we announced the availability of our invensense positioning library or ipl software enabling sensorassisted positioning which in combination with existing locations technologies such as gnss enable higher precision and robust user experiences such as in urban canyons parking structures and indoor navigation with industryleading accuracy and the capability to fuse multiple location technologies our solution is already shipping commercially in top brand smartphones additionally we are seeing active design interest from a highly diverse customer set outside mobile including application layer customers looking to license this product as a standalone software suite we believe that navigation and context will be among the next major applications driving sensor proliferation in the mobile device wearable industrial and automotive markets and our investment in this area gives us a substantial lead over competing solutions similarly our early investments in imaging stabilization have allowed us to achieve a marketleading position in this key application during fiscal  optical image stabilization technology was adopted by tier  manufacturers and is now on the roadmap of nearly every premium smartphone brand as a result our ois sales increased by  from the previous fiscal year providing invensense with a substantial content opportunity within the mobile device market we believe ois attach rates in mobile platforms are likely to double in  to approximately  and sales thus far in the calendar year indicate that we are well on track for this level of growth in addition we offer the most complete suite of hardware and software to enable electronic image stabilization capabilities for video or panoramic imaging or for ois architectures that leverage the main axis motiontracking devices we expect that over time device manufacturers will expand the number of integrated cameras that offer ois imaging capabilities and we are well positioned to support this application in a variety of imaging architectures with ois and software and algorithm content expansion opportunities already contributing to our results were also beginning to gain traction with many of our newer motion and audio sensor products announced in fiscal  for example we recently won a key reference platform with a mobile device manufacturer in china for our new m series multicore hub in which our solution replaces what would have been a discrete sensor and a sensor hub architecture this device is a member of our recentlybranded firefly product family the worlds first sensor system on chip platform integrating mems sensors with multicore sensor processors and embedded arm core memory and an open software framework the integrated sensor processors are designed to collect and process data from internal and external sensors for data classification runtime calibration and data fusion thereby saving system power and improving performance the invensense software framework in combination with industrystandard arm tool chain provides an open and powerful platform for creating cutting edge alwayson applications across many product segments firefly products from invensense function as a sensor hub that developers can use to rapidly develop and launch new sensorbased features customer response to our first firefly product has been positive as the open arm development environment allows them to further differentiate their product through customizable features while initial firefly traction is coming from the mobile device manufacturers the solution is also attracting the interest from a variety of applications outside of mobile including wearables smart home gaming drones industrial and automotive the open development platform small footprint and power efficiency make it compelling as a standalone device or as the basis for a modular iot device solution with full connectivity and memory turning to audio we continue to secure wins in highperformance applications across a number of verticals following our january announcement of six groundbreaking new products traction for highend audio and mobile device is still emerging but we are seeing increased interest increasing interest in the use of these solutions in contextual awareness application which can fuse data gathered from a myriad of sensors including motion sound and environmental the same principle applies to the megatrend of iot where many types of sensors will ultimately connect a wide variety of devices across a highly fragmented set of vertical markets we believe we have the best technology platform for creating and integrating sensors and combining them with the sophistication required to enable the most comprehensive contextually intelligent iot solutions in conclusion fiscal  was a transformational year for invensense as our success in mobile and the advancement of our platform strategy laid important groundwork for continued achievement in the coming years we enter fiscal  with unprecedented scale in fabless mems and greater manufacturing and development scales and many cmosonly fabless semiconductor companies weve established a respected record of meeting the stringent customer demands and offer a broad portfolio of industryleading sensor system solutions that we believe will continue to fuel customer and revenue diversification collectively our current offering has the potential to double our served available market opening up incremental revenue growth opportunities over the coming quarters further these products and others in the years pipeline provide us with multiple entry points into verticals beyond mobile such as wearables smart home industrial and automotive where our technology provides significant value across a wide variety of applications while we expect mobile to remain the predominant contributor to our revenue in fiscal  we are actively building partnerships and channels and engaging with customers in adjacent markets in order to drive our growth and development our products are serving an everincreasing number of opportunities where demand is increasing steadily for lowpower precision motion tracking and audio and we believe that many of these opportunities bring the potential to be the meaningful revenue and profit growth contributors in the years to come with that ill turn the call back to mark for guidance for the first quarter of  mark p dentinger  chief financial officer thank you behrooz for q fiscal  we are estimating that total revenue will be within a range of  million to  million our expectation for nongaap gross margins in q is a range between  and  nongaap operating expenses are expected to rise by about  million compared with q our nongaap net other expense and our tax rate should be about flat with q nongaap eps should be within a range of  to  per share assuming an average share count of about  million if you are modeling us on a gaap basis our gross margins should be between  and  and gaap eps should be between a  loss and breakeven in q this concludes our prepared remarks and now ill turn the call back over to our operator alex for your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of cody acree with ascendiant capital please proceed cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc thanks guys and congrats on a good quarter behrooz you went through some of this but maybe if you can give a little more specifics and now that you have such a strong position with the top two handset makers could rank order your  expectations and maybe give some degree of magnitude as far as revenue contribution or just growth drivers outside of those top two oems behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well in terms of a rank order i believe that the growth will continue to come from china and ois were really excited about the trend that we see in the ois as i mentioned we see that its on the roadmap of every premium handset brand today keep in mind that today overall we still serve only  of the total mobile market so theres a great deal of opportunity especially as the overall mobile market matures we see that the premium brands continue to expand and again its mostly in emerging markets like china and mostly on the back of new features like imaging like camera ois so thats what were really excited about at the same time we are – as i mentioned on the call in the script – we are seeing early traction with the embedded hub our firefly platform that integrates the arm core that has quite a bit of potential to increase the content and stickiness for us so thats a initiative that well continue to push aggressively into the market and as we move that into the market with our customers well see a greater deal of attachment from other sensors that want to come through the hub through hub with our software and that will drive further stickiness with the software so its a – i feel that were going to get into a virtuous cycle here between the software and the hardware with our new platform cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc and then behrooz as you look at china as a driver could you just talk about the health of the inventory channel a lot of the component vendors have been talking about an inventory correction here in q and maybe feeling a bit better about q id just like to get your view on that and then your competitive position in china and if those chinese oems continue to gain share globally what impact might that have on your gross margins behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director in terms of the inventories we dont really get impacted as much because we are continuing to increase our attach rates so its not like a maturing market that we see a lot of that so on the inventory we really havent seen much of an impact on us so in terms of our position in china we feel pretty strongly especially as the top two tier  – tier  customers here in the us and in korea theyre trying to get into china and into other markets and the chinese obviously need to differentiate themselves so for them whats really important is differentiation time to market and thats where were the strongest anytime they want to get to market with new features around sensors which is really one of the very few places you can differentiate anymore we believe that we got a very strong position theyre not looking for just a raw sensor theyre looking for a suite of software and integration and new features such as ois imaging and navigation and other features that they can drive into the market faster than the tier  so we think that that trend will continue cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc and mark with those local vendors continuing to grow are you expecting much of an impact on overall gross margins mark p dentinger  chief financial officer well that element of our gross margin mix is generally a positive contributor we do a little bit better there in part because they like the solutionoriented element of what we offer so if the china market is strong that typically can be good news for our gross margins cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc great thanks guys good luck behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of matt ramsay with canaccord please proceed matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc good afternoon guys thank you my first question is just to continue on china from some work weve done and just reading the industry data it looks like lte smartphones in china could go from  million or so last year to  million plus this year behrooz maybe you could let us know where your axis attach rate is in china right now and where you see it in emerging lte smartphones that are sold through the year thanks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think the attach rates has gone up since last year to something around  percentage type of a number and with lte obviously anytime you have a lot more bandwidth it means a lot more download of applications and a lot of these applications use motiontracking devices but more importantly for imaging its also pretty exciting because more bandwidth means that youre going to snap a lot more pictures that youre going to send over the network and thats where ois really – all kinds of image stabilization really shines both ois and eis which is the electronic images stabilization for taking videos so we think those are all positive trends for us and were monitoring it so well see where that goes matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc right understood and then i guess if you look forward in your business through the year i mean either behrooz or mark the guidance i think for revenue was a bit higher than i had anticipated anyway for q given the seasonality of oems et cetera maybe you could give a little bit of color as to the dynamic of the top line seasonality et cetera through the year obviously this years seasonal will look a little different than last year given the fact that you have the new bigger customer in cupertino now so any color you can give on seasonality through the year would be really helpful thank you behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well let me start and then maybe mark can chime in a little bit in terms of – youre right its a little bit different this year one is for because of the market share not just with north america but also across the globe including china but also the content including ois that has gone up also we – our products theres a number of tier  phones that are coming out that have ois attached to them and that content increase is also driving a little bit of different dynamic for us than the rest of the world with that do you have anything to add to that mark p dentinger  chief financial officer yeah its a fair point matt in the sense that right now were obviously revenue strong and it is still primarily a big bulk of that is coming from our strength at the big two oems the dynamic should play out over the course of the year a little bit differently than last year because of the big ramp as you pointed out in q of last year from the north american customer but right now we are – it is revenue strong and the focus of the business is trying to meet all of that demand and keep up with the manufacturing requirements matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc thanks ill get back in the queue thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ruben roy with piper jaffray please proceed ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker thanks mark if i could just followup on matts question in terms of the big customers and seasonally as we look out into the second half of this year i know you discussed a little bit on the gross margin and some of the impacts as maybe china ramps up eventually but kind of more near term second half of this year do you think gross margins sort of stick in this  to  range as those big customers ramp into the seasonally stronger period of the year or how does that play out mark p dentinger  chief financial officer to be honest with you what i see right now is a mids profile with our current mix of products and our current customers what makes it a little difficult to forecast out toward the end of the second half of this year is that as these new products come in and if we get some additional pull from ois in terms of its contribution to the total mix we could get some gross margin relief at that point but i think right now from the demand with our current profile i see mids plus or minus through the middle of this year the nuance to that question is well do you see towards the end of the year some pullup we should be able to tell that if in q we start processing meaningful orders we would obviously process those in q and theyd flow through the pl at that point or if we get new pull from products that we have introduced this year and they dont – that doesnt materialize in q obviously we wont feel that until q of the following year so i think the safest answer is i see mids plus or minus until we break out with the new products ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker thats helpful thanks for the detail mark and then a followup for behrooz on the m and congratulations on the reference platform win can you talk a little bit about the type of phone that youre seeing traction you mentioned there were other mobile oems looking at the solution im just wondering is this a highend reference platform or more of a medium range smartphone that youre having initial success with behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thats actually a great question and its tough to answer because the medium and highend are starting to morph into each other quite frankly i think that what weve seen in the last year is that the high end phones had a separate sensor hub for example and just a myriad of sensors and those phones are starting to go into the midtier and where were really trying to address with this product was that as ive always said that really theres no need for a separate socket a sensor hub socket in these phones that eventually its going to get disintegrated into all the other processing chips that are in the phone and thats what were seeing so for the most part i would say its in the mid to high tier with the very high tier most likely will probably continue to have a separate sensor hub for a while until the architectures all these other architectures eat into that so thats where i would characterize this type of a product ruben roy  piper jaffray  co broker good okay thats all i had thanks behrooz behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of ted moreau with barrington research please proceed theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc thanks for taking my questions just guys you were talking a lot about the internet of things in your prepared remarks so i was just curious are these timeframes moving forward from your previous expectations and therefore this gets a little bit more exciting for fiscal  behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director i think the whole internet of things its really – as you know its a very fragmented market and the majority of them if not all of them use some kind of a sensor so were obviously focused on the ones that use motion sound and as we bring to bear other sensors in the future but its very fragmented so we are already seeing design wins in those markets but because of the fragmentation this is really about building channels and so that process has started actually one or two quarters ago and well continue to see this going forward i dont think in the iot theres maybe some markets that youll see big chunks like maybe wearables at some point or automotive but for the most part what youre going to see is continued buildup and thats one of the reasons that the product that we have – especially this recent firefly product is really targeted not just for mobile but for the iot where you typically have a sensor have some kind of an arm core and then you attach some kind of a connectivity to it and we felt that we can take on the processing and the sensor piece and the algorithms and then just attach connectivity and really have an iot ready product and were already seeing that happening theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay that sounds good thanks and then recent teardowns of a fairly highprofile wearable showed that invensense was not included so just wondering if there were any technological hurdles that maybe you didnt satisfy or if you have any comments and could address that behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director no not really there wasnt anything technology related what weve said in the past is that our product shines in the wearables that need to be very very power conscience and need to be recharged maybe once a week or once every two weeks so as long as youre not doing something like that as long as you have to charge it every day theres different sets of values different sets of requirements for that but there wasnt really anything technically in there – technologically in those types of decisions at that level theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay thank you very much behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director all right operator your next question comes from the line of mark delaney with goldman sachs please proceed mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co yeah good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions first question is a followup on the m product with the integrated sensor hub can you give us a sense for the relative uplift you may see on asps as you start including that sort of functionality into the gyroscope i mean are we talking about something on the order of  or   and then how we should think about the gross margin potential of that product and if that would be within the target gross margin range for the company behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah in terms of the uplift i would say its anywhere in the range of  to  because of the arm core and the memory theres just a lot capabilities and the multiple cores in that and in terms of gross margin obviously its too early to tell we are targeting that to be well above the corporate margin but well see how the market bears but yeah thats where were targeting it for mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co okay and then just in terms of the breadth of potential customers that may adopt that product behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah certainly mobile is one target but when you have the arm core and a lot of memory and software you can really address a lot of socalled iot devices so from wearables were seeing smart home which starts with motion and audio remote controls where we have both the software we brought the software from movea for example for motion remote for tvs and were already seeing traction with that weve already gotten design wins with that so those are just some of the starting markets but we do see it going to just about anything including drones and automotive and industrial in the few quarters so we really do see it as a great iot device mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and then behrooz one last followup you talked about expanding the addressable market into some of these other categories – wearables or drones or automotive ois and mobile though still drive the bulk of the companys revenue today how quickly do you think some of these new markets could make up a larger percentage of the companys sales maybe something in the  or higher range as you look out behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director im hopeful that by – in the next fiscal year not – i dont see it this fiscal year in terms of iot obviously the design wins they take – its a gestation time there for – because its really about building channels now in terms of the solution itself its channels and software and we have the software we have the technology is applicable the sensors itself it really lends itself to all those markets so were really working with the ecosystem with a lot of partners software partners in other markets and getting on reference designs thats the work thats the heavy lifting that were doing the arm core the memory all that the hardware work is done its all about software and channels mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co thank you very much behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director did i answer your question just want to make sure mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co yeah you did that was helpful thank you behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director all right right operator your next question comes from the line of joe moore with morgan stanley please proceed joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you you had talked about the microphone progress with several different verticals can you give us a little bit of color on which verticals you are serving there and then can you give us a sense of timeframe to get microphones back into phones behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director okay yeah the microphones – what we see is that we definitely have the highestperforming microphones in terms of certain hardware specs so the designs that – the feedback that we get back from the market where were getting design wins are products like enterprise phones tvs largescreen tvs where most places where you have – you require a very high signal to noise ratio in some of the enterprise communication devices automotive those are some of the examples wearables because of the small size so those are some of the examples of the design wins that we have in the mobile side there are some design wins that were looking at that were getting traction but quite frankly as i said the highperformance audio is still in the early stages in the mobile we run into – and we expected this when we started that well run into good enough kind of issue with a lot of the phones for communication you really dont need highperformance because you are really limited by the channel itself by the cellular channel but as lte voiceover lte wideband voice comes into play thats where we think we have more opportunity so were looking at a lot of those but i dont – its pretty much in line with what we had expected in the mobile side joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thank you and then for my followup – unless i missed it i didnt hear you talking about axis in your prepared comments – can you talk about is axis still a part of your customers roadmap in the short and intermediate term behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yes yes absolutely yeah we have actually started sampling the axis a while ago and its in – and the customers – and again thats because its a new sensor were not going into the mainstream yet and a lot of the guys that we talk to on the mobile side theyre not sure what they do with the pressure sensor that they have today so what were doing is weve developed a lot of software for context and navigation that were pulling together with the axis but we definitely have started to sample customers we have a couple of design wins so it is very much a part of our roadmap and youll be hearing more about that in the future joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of richard shannon with craighallum capital group please proceed jorge eduardo rivas reyna  craighallum capital group llc hey guys this is jorge sitting for richard today most of my questions have been asked already but im wondering if you can comment a little bit on your gross margins specifically on your two owned  – your top two mobile customers and can you just give us a general sense of the pricing trends with them mark p dentinger  chief financial officer yeah well i cant give you any specific date on that jorge for confidentiality reasons but all i can say is that as is true with larger customers there tend to be pricing agreements that go over multiple periods and then the impact on gross margins is a function of the absolute magnitude that they contribute in terms of the customer mix plus how the average selling prices move with respect to average unit cost to production so with respect at the unit level computation its basically a function of how the average selling prices move relative to your improvements in yield over time and those customers right now are doing a lot of volume and we smoothed things out but right now theyre a fairly large mix of our portfolio we anticipate that they will continue to be at least through the middle of this year so those are the dynamics but i cant share anything more with respect to the specifics i hope you understand jorge eduardo rivas reyna  craighallum capital group llc okay i understand thanks for that one last followup on the firefly sensor hub can you guys provide any idea as far as the timing for an uptake of these units are we looking at win  towards the second half of the year or is this more of  behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director firefly sensor hub mark p dentinger  chief financial officer in terms of shipments you mean jorge eduardo rivas reyna  craighallum capital group llc yes mark p dentinger  chief financial officer yeah i think itll be – by the time you get through the design phase which we are in right now and start shipping itll be towards the end of the fiscal year by the time they ramp up its a little bit longer cycle than we have been with the regular axis and axis and all that just because of the added complexity the arm core all of the software that the customers actually have to put on there from their end but yeah it should be starting out conservatively the end of this fiscal year jorge eduardo rivas reyna  craighallum capital group llc okay all right thats all for me good luck gentlemen thanks mark p dentinger  chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tom sepenzis with northland capital markets please proceed tom sepenzis  northland securities inc hi thank you for taking my question you gave a little bit of color in terms of the axis penetration or attach rate in china i was wondering if you could provide the same kind for the ois and where are today where you think you can be end of this year behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director as i mentioned in the script we see ois heading towards that  attach rate of their premium handsets this year which is double over last fiscal year and we pretty much – the trend that weve seen is supporting that the revenue and shipment trends are supporting that i could get really excited about it and then take it even higher just because we see it on everybodys road map these days but were trying to make sure that those guys hit their ramps and come out before i get even more excited but certainly we do see very strong traction just because of the – if you look at these smartphones especially the higher tier smartphones its really getting more its getting difficult to differentiate over too many things and camera and imaging is one of the very few places where its very tangible differentiation in the use case and we see that happening this year tom sepenzis  northland securities inc great thank you and did i hear correctly that the gross margins for that product is better than corporate right now behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director typically is has been yes tom sepenzis  northland securities inc excellent thank you and then lastly i just was wondering if you could provide some kind of update in terms of the competitive landscape obviously over the last year or two youve perhaps taken the lions share of the market and im just curious as to what youre competitors are doing to try and get back in if youre seeing them drop prices or doing anything drastic that we need to watch out for nine months from now behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well we really havent seen them behave too differently than the past its been really around mostly around pricing and so we dont expect the pricing landscape in terms of trends to really change that much and quite frankly this is what we expected two three years ago when we embarked on building more value and thats the reason that we started making the investment in software and building the system because we felt that as playing in the component game eventually you are going to run into this situation where you have to make some decisions on either pricing or market share and so we expect that the competition will continue we havent seen change in their behavior in terms of building up systems or architectures or software its really a component game for them theyre a very good companies theyve got great components but the dynamic is still around pricing so our focus is to really continue to build the value and at the component level obviously we continue to improve our cost structure and build the improved performance and yet there are places where we wont be chasing over after every socket if it becomes a good enough pricing only there are prices that we would probably have to walk away from some sockets at some point but our path is towards building system soc and more stickiness on that system side tom sepenzis  northland securities inc great thank you so much behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director okay operator and your next question comes from the line of suji de silva with topeka please proceed suji de silva  topeka capital markets hi behrooz hi mark just a followup question on the ois just a clarification the  attach rate you quoted towards the end of the year was that for the overall market or for china specifically and if it is for just china are you seeing traction for the ois outside of the china market behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director no thats for overall thats attach rate to the premium handsets so if you look at premium handset being about   to  we do see the premium handsets growing faster than the overall market but if you keep that in mind then were talking about  of that and thats worldwide including china definitely we do see a lot of interest in china actually ahead some of the other parts of the world so i think thats a trend that will continue this year suji de silva  topeka capital markets okay great and my other question is on the m product its a more design cycle intensive software processor intensive product is it through the reference platforms that customers can take that to market or do they use your software customize their own software how does that process go where they take advantage of it and still get to market in a reasonable amount of time behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director its both the reference design helps us in terms of being able to get to the market faster its a channel for us we still do most of the software in terms of the integration in terms of sensor especially when we have the multiple cores the arm core for the most part is reserved for the customers for their features and we use up our the multicore the digital processor the dmps that we have and we program those basically what we do is we take away a lot of the standard features like calibration and fusion out of the way and we do those at very low power inside those dsps so we do most of that work and we do most of the plumbing in terms of the hardware software integration so when it goes on the reference gets to the oems ideally the oems only have to use the arm core for their own features now we do work with the oems directly also so its not just a reference design that we count on but it does make our job easier and if they happen to use that reference design or that processor it makes our job a whole lot easier in terms of supporting customers suji de silva  topeka capital markets thanks for the color behrooz operator your next question comes from the line of krishna shankar with roth capital please proceed krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc yes i may have missed this answer but what were the top two customers as a percent of the revenue and also what were china customers collectively as a percent of revenue this quarter mark p dentinger  chief financial officer yeah the top two were  and  this quarter krishna and i believe china was  of total revenues this quarter krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc thank you and then with respect to the sensor hub that you just discussed the arm core on that is that the m or the m and do you feel that it has capabilities for lowerend wearables such as fitness and health bands or complete the smart watches running android wear and full os can you talk about the application with respect to either fitness bands versus full smart watches behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director great question its an m processor but when you combine it with the dsps it really has the performance of an m arm core with the power at very low power at a fraction of the power so thats really – thats the reason for the hybrid architecture and we dont expect it to be the main processor in a wearable device so if youve got a – and depending on the wearable or any other device so if youve got a – if youre really looking to run a heavy os like android you need another processor and you need a fullblown microcontroller even microcontrollers may not do it you really need a microprocessor like a snapdragon or mediateks processor but if youre looking to do all the sensor functions and some of the other functions around that then its very very capable its more than capable to do in doing that so its designed mostly for realtime operating systems in terms of operating sensor data not for a heavy os like android krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc so it would be a good fit for things like health and fitness wearables things like that behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director its a perfect fit for devices like that yeah because youre really collecting data and sending it over a bluetooth to a smartphone but if you really have to run an operating system with all kinds of display functionalities and other applications its really not a fit for that but for health and fitness absolutely its a great fit yes krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of alex gauna with jmp securities please proceed alex d gauna  jmp securities llc hey thanks for taking my questions congratulations on the nice result behrooz you piqued my curiosity when in touching on microphones you talked about tv applications im wondering if that is in regards to your new mic that you are making that comment in terms of the high signaltonoise ratio that youve achieved and if so what about that is making it applicable in the smart tv market i would think thats the market thats less concerned with mems spacing and energy efficiencies than say the mobile market thanks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thanks for the clarifying question thats actually a good question its really not as much around power and space efficiency that particular application for motion remotes it is about power and space efficiency in the tv itself its about far field performance the same as in a enterprise phone a speaker phone like what we are using today its really about the signal to noise and really the signal clarity and thats where we win in those markets so if you look at the announcements that we did – we basically microphone is one of those devices you cant just have one device that wins them all you have to have a myriad of applications size performance different sizes and performance and thats so we have some that really fit into the tv and enterprise applications because of performance and then there are the ones that are in motion remotes and other wearables which is really about size efficiency and power alex d gauna  jmp securities llc okay i got it and then one more – and behrooz youve touched on these topics a number of times in the call already but with regard to the virtuous cycle that youre excited about for firefly is there a particular reason in that instantiation where youre not as worried about partitioning or integration risk such as theres a longer tail to its opportunity in the market thanks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director yeah if you look at theres a lot of sensors in these devices into phones into just about every one of these smart devices these days and the one sensor thats truly always on is really motion because thats the one sensor that tells you whether the context of the device where the device is and that combined with sound so the virtuous cycle that im talking about is that as you use the device you start out with some key applications which for us has been imaging and navigation and as we build those together and then we build context around navigation and context we mean where are you what are you doing how does it feel kind of thing as we start to build those we feel that the arm core and the processor becomes a hub for developers and for customers for oems to develop their own features to add other sensors that we havent thought about to really improve the context and really differentiate their products and that continues to – but when they do that they have to really use our core software to attach to and that really creates a virtuous cycle for us an example of this we have today we have well over  developers and these developers in the past theyve been using our sensors and then they go off and buy our microcontroller and they developed their products and they do a lot of that on their own and they have to spend a lot of money a lot of time doing software that quite frankly could be completely embedded inside the motion hub and when we do that this really does become a – truly an iot device where the developers can take and they can bring their own features their own sensors and attach it to it so all of that really creates a cycle around a processor where our software and their software really get create a higher level of integration and a higher level of performance alex d gauna  jmp securities llc okay i get it thanks congratulations nice quarter behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director thank you mark p dentinger  chief financial officer thank you operator and you have a followup question from the line of cody acree with ascendiant capital please proceed cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc thanks guys just one quick followup behrooz you mentioned that things maybe on a competitive landscape hasnt changed all that much technically or pricing wise but going back to a prior question on the apple watch and your lack of inclusion there with your prior lead your early lead in module integration and then seeing stmicro included there have we seen the competitors step up with their module ability or is that maybe i guess a harbinger of things to come behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director no i dont think so i think again st has been there before with axis and other devices so i dont think its – i wouldnt read too much into a particular design again we dont expect to win every socket there are a lot of factors that come into play when the customer makes a buying decision and we do see it as an opportunity for us so its a growth opportunity going forward and we think that we have a really outstanding solution for wearables and so in that particular case i wouldnt read into it as a harbinger of things to come so yeah cody g acree  ascendiant capital markets llc very good thank you behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director those are  right place to be thank you operator there are no additional questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr behrooz abdi president and ceo for closing remarks behrooz l abdi  president chief executive officer  director well thank you everyone for participating in a productive call
