mcneal help you with feebased management financial planning retirement consulting risk management and estate plans we are located in boise idaho buffington mohr mcneal  financial insight in the months ahead it seems likely that the chatter will grow louder on financial tv stations and across the web about how terrible higher bond yields are going to be for stocks this has happened in previous periods of rising rates prognosticators are probably going to make three arguments one that higher bond yields provide competition to dividend yields which will make stocks less attractive secondly that higher bond yields drive down the market’s pricetoearnings ratio and lastly that higher bond yields will choke economic growth sending stocks lower wall street’s talking heads have already been out in force in the media warning that rising interest rates will hurt stocks when you hear these forecasts remember that many if not mostof wall street’s prognosticators have a bad track record for predicting the market’s next move so when bond yields start to rise and you hear the refrain “rising bond yields are bad for stocks” don’t believe it httpwwwbmmriacompagesfnewshtm bmmriacom let
