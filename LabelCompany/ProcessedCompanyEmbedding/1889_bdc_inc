complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or for an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  the fund is a delaware corporation organized as a closedend management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a bdc under section a of the act the funds objectives and strategies  are to generate consistent absolute returns through cash coupons fees and when available equity coinvestments while minimizing the risk of loss and to generate consistent absolute returns the fund invests in senior secured debt second lien loans mezzanine loans senior secured stretch and unitranche facilities as well as to a lesser extent equity coinvestments the board of directors of the fund the “board” is comprised of  directors  of whom are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the  act the “independent directors” of the fund  the bdc adviser is a delaware limited liability company which will be registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  the “advisers act” prior to commencement of operations of the fund the bdc adviser serves as investment adviser to the fund and is a whollyowned subsidiary of the existing affiliated adviser  each existing affiliated fund is an entity that would be an investment company but for section c or c of the act the existing affiliated funds pursue strategies focused on investing in a variety of fixed income and credit investmentsstart printed page   the existing affiliated adviser is a delaware limited partnership and is registered as an investment adviser under the advisers act the existing affiliated adviser serves as investment adviser to each of the existing affiliated funds  applicants seek an order “order” to permit a regulated fund  and one or more regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds  to coinvest with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which the adviser to the regulated fund negotiates terms in addition to price  and b make additional investments in securities of such issuers including through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers “followon investments” through a proposed coinvestment program the “coinvestment program” where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section a and rule d and the rules under the  act the term “coinvestment transaction” means any transaction in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment subsidiary as defined below participate together with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds in reliance on the requested order potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment subsidiary as defined below could not participate together with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more other affiliated funds without obtaining and relying on the order  applicants state that a regulated fund may from time to time form a whollyowned investment subsidiary such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with any other regulated fund or affiliated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment subsidiary be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the requested order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the adviser expects that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification  other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act “eligible directors” and the “required majority” as defined in section o of the act “required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no independent director of a regulated fund will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the regulated funds  applicants also represent that if the advisers or its principal owners “principals” or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the advisers or the principals and start printed page the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting securities of a regulated fund “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as required under condition  applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the advisers or the principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly applicants represent that the noninterested directors will evaluate and approve any such independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis

basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief the regulated funds would be in some circumstances limited in

therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub   the term whollyowned investment sub means an entity i that is whollyowned by a regulated fund with the regulated fund at all times holding beneficially and of record  of the voting and economic interests ii whose sole business purpose is to hold one or more investments on behalf of the regulated fund iii with respect to which the regulated funds board has the sole authority to make all determinations with respect to the entitys participation under the conditions of the application and iv that would be an investment company but for section c or c of the act   when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the adviser expects that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification   the regulated funds however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them   other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act eligible directors and the required majority as defined in section o of the act required majority  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund   in the case of a regulated fund that is a registered closedend fund the board members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the regulated fund were a bdc subject to section o   with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no independent director of a regulated fund will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the regulated funds  applicants also represent that if the advisers or its principal owners principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the advisers or the principals and page  the affiliated funds collectively the holders own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting securities of a regulated fund shares then the holders will vote such shares as required under condition  applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the advisers or the principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly applicants represent that the noninterested directors will evaluate and approve any such independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section a of the act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a bdc from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by a bdc in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission under section b of the act any person who is directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with a bdc is subject to section a applicants submit that each of the regulated funds and affiliated funds be deemed to be a person related to each regulated fund in a manner described by section b by virtue of being under common control section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commissions rules under section d of the act applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a because the commission has not adopted any rules under section a rule d also applies to joint transactions with regulated funds that are bdcs section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated funds that are registered closedend investment companies  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the commission has granted an order permitting such transactions in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers whether the companys participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief the regulated funds would be in some circumstances limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each regulated funds shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the act applicants state that the regulated funds participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous

rata based on each participants capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated up to the amount proposed to be invested by each the applicable adviser will provide the eligible

with a the interests of the shareholders of the regulated fund and b the regulated funds thencurrent objectives and strategies iii the investment by any other regulated funds or affiliated funds would
