yanchunthis book presents advanced methodologies in two areas related to electroencephalogram eeg signals detection of epileptic seizures and identification of mental states in brain computer interface bci systems the proposed methods enable the extraction of this vital information from eeg signals in order to accurately detect abnormalities revealed by the eeg new methods will relieve the timeconsuming and errorprone practices that are currently in use common signal processing methodologies include wavelet transformation and fourier transformation but these methods are not capable of managing the size of eeg data addressing the issue this book examines new eeg signal analysis approaches with a combination of statistical techniques eg random sampling optimum allocation and machine learning methods the developed methods provide better results than the existing methods the book also offers applications of the developed methodologies that have been tested on several realtime benchmark databases this book concludes with thoughts on the future of the field and anticipated research challenges it gives new direction to the field of analysis and classification of eeg signals through these more efficient methodologies researchers and experts will benefit from its suggested improvements to the current computeraided based diagnostic systems for the precise analysis and management of eeg signalsartificial intelligence general generalcondition hpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new unused and unmarked in flawless conditionfinelike new f no defects little usage may

between ordering in organic semiconductor thin films and device performance it is becoming more essential to exercise control of the ordering through structural tuning many recent studies have focused on the influence of side chain engineering on polymer packing orientation in thin films however the impact of the size and conformation of aromatic surfaces on thin film ordering has not been investigated in great detail here we introduce a diskshaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon building block with a large π surface namely thienoazacoronenes tacs as a donor monomer for conjugated polymers a series of medium bandgap conjugated polymers have been synthesized by copolymerizing tac with electron donating monomers of varying size the incorporation of the tac unit in such semiconducting polymers allows a systematic investigation both experimentally and theoretically of the relationships between polymer conformation electronic structure thin film morphology and charge transport properties field effect transistors based on these polymers have shown good hole mobilities and photoresponses proving that tac is a promising building block for high performance

separation of crystalline block copolymer  investigated the effects of molecular weight and film thickness on the crystallization and microphase separation by insitu hot stage atomic force microscope molecular weight determined the phase separation strength and molecular migration rate affect the crystal nucleation and phase separation film thickness affected the crystalline rate crystals grew very slowly in much thinner film the incompatibility drove the film evolved into spinodallike morphology  the competition between single crystal and microphase separation realized the transition between crystallization and microphase separation under the effect of solvent vapor selectivity the gain of free volume of soluble block and the low swelling of crystalline block are key for microphase separation and crystallization respectively  the crystallization and microphase separation of allconjugated block copolymer film crystallization and microphase separation coexisted during thin film forming process through the modulation of the block composition and annealing process the competition between the microphase separation and crystallization was tuned leading to observations of confined crystallization and breakout crystallization  transfer printing technology based on the differences of interface adhesions and its applications in order to avoid the flee between optoelectronic devices and the damage of performance of optoelectronic devices in wet micromachining we developed a transfer printing technology with the interface interaction as the driving force and

organic lightemitting displays our focus are the key problems of patterning organic lightemitting displays by inkjet printing such as low patterning resolution nonuniform thickness of inkjet printed films and aggregation of molecules which would decrease the lightemitting efficiency dramatically some methods and corresponding theories have been explored to resolve these problems  separators with tshape cross section and low surface energy were patterned by soft lithography assisted by low surface energy separators the inkjet printing has double patterning resolution  we have posed the idea of adjustment of thickness uniformity combined with microstructure for inkjet printed organic lightemitting films and the establishing design principle of solution systems two kinds of solution systems which can form flow field in the drying solution such as convection churning and restrained edge flow were established and used to improve thickness uniformity used good solvent combined with accelerated drying to restrain aggregation of molecules from thermodynamics and kinetics smooth and amorphous organic lightemitting films were inkjet printed based on the upward research results we

generating photocurrents our research is focused on the core problem based on the morphology of conjugated polymer films  the mechanisms for additive to modify the phtpcbm morphology the mechanisms for introduction of the additive to improve the phtpcbm organic solar cells performance are investigated the results reveal that ndodecylthiol reduces the pht chains entanglement in the solution and the influence of pcbm on the pht molecular interaction during the filmforming process  a quasiordered bulk heterojuction of phtpcbm solar cells fabricated by zonecasting a quasiordered bulk hetertojuction in which pht nanofibers aligned in an oriented manner due to the shear stress and solute concentration gradient was fabricated by zonecasting the oriented alignment of nanofibers could facilitate pht chains to bridge nanofibers furthermore the bridging chains tended to adopt an untwisted conformation which result in a reduced energy barrier of hole transfer and better device performance  mixedsolvent vapor annealing to inhibit intercalated behavior we inhibited the intercalated behavior and constructed the nanointerpenetrating structure of pcdtbtpcbm induced by aggregation of pcbm via mixedsolvent vapor annealing msva tetrahydrofuran thfcarbon disulfide cs after the msva the pcbm molecules having good solubility with thf diffused out of pcdtbt side chains and formed large aggregates which induced phase separation meanwhile the migration ability of pcdtbt chains was improved due to its good solubility with cs which enhanced its selforganization ability
