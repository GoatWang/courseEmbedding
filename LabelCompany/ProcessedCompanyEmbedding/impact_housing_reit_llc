we borrowed from heng fai enterprises an aggregate of  the hfe loan we have used  of the hfe loan to acquire single family homes and for corporate operations leaving a balance of  currently held in escrow for future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes the hfe loan is unsecured due on demand and bears no interest on april   we agreed with heng fai to convert  of the hfe loan and

through any third parties the inability to raise funds through third parties may negatively impact our company we are externally managed and advised by interamerican management corporation the advisor and the leasing managing and advertising of our properties is overseen and directed by various thirdparty property managers although the company remains reliant on heng fai enterprises for capital the company expects to seek third party financing in  we currently have no agreements to obtain loans or lines of credit through any third parties the inability to raise funds through third parties may negatively impact our company as of december   we owned  properties in texas with an aggregate investment of  we are currently evaluating new markets to identify investment opportunities that we believe can generate attractive riskadjusted returns for our stockholders there is no assurance that we will close on the properties we have under contract strategy our primary business strategy is to acquire lease and manage singlefamily homes as wellmaintained investment properties to generate attractive riskadjusted returns over the longterm we employ a disciplined and focused approach to evaluating acquisition opportunities considering the mix of rent yield and future home price appreciation potential when selecting a market and investment our strategic aggregation of singlefamily homes provides a strong foundation for creating longterm home price appreciation in our portfolio we believe our founders years of experience in the singlefamily rental sector provides us with the expertise to successfully execute our business strategy nationally to institutional standards we are building the infrastructure to acquire large numbers of properties through multiple acquisition channels we source individual properties through wholesalers aggregators and brokers and portfolios of properties through brokerages or directly from operators investors or banks and in the future we may source assets from these channels and governmentsponsored entities or gses we generally source homes that are in rentready condition to a standard that we believe appeals to our target tenants preferences enabling us to attract qualified tenants and to provide a high level of service to retain our tenants we plan to continue acquiring singlefamily homes in markets that satisfy our investment criteria we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december   assuming that we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our stockholders and meet other specific requirements if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and we may be ineligible to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years even if we qualify as a reit we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and our trs which

of third quarter of  acquisitions factors expected to affect our results and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include our pace of acquisitions and ability to deploy our capital the amount of time and cost required to stabilize newly acquired properties and convert them to revenue generating assets rental rates occupancy levels rates of tenant turnover our expense ratios and capital structure property acquisitions the acquisition of properties involves the expenditure of capital in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes hoa fees when applicable and restoration costs revenue in each of our markets we monitor a number of factors that may impact the singlefamily real estate market and our tenants finances including the unemployment rate household formation and net population growth income growth size and makeup of existing and anticipated housing stock prevailing market rental and mortgage rates rental vacancies and credit availability growth in demand for rental housing in excess of the growth of rental housing supply among other factors will generally drive higher occupancy and rental rates negative trends in our markets with respect to these metrics or others could adversely impact our rental revenue the growth of our portfolio has been initiated in recent months as we have commenced acquiring properties in texas we are actively identifying other markets in which to invest expenses propertyrelated expenses property management overhead based on our experience we believe that the propertyrelated expenses for vacancy bad debt property taxes insurance hoa fees repairs and maintenance and capital expenditure reserves and the costs for property management services such as managing the process of restoring marketing leasing and maintaining our stabilized singlefamily homes will average a significant amount of gross rental revenue variations in asset level returns will be due to a variety of factors including location age and condition of the property and the efficiency of our property management services results of operations for the three months ended december   we believe our financial results during the three months ended december   are not representative of our future financial results as this was the initial period of our sfr
