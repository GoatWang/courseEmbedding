since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search forget energy transfer equity lp here are  better dividend stocks there’s something to be said for an easytounderstand investment matthew dilallo tmfmd feb   at pm energy transfer equity nyseete can be a very complex company to understand because its income is derived from its ownership interests in a number of affiliated mlps for a lot of investors this complexity alone is a turnoff however it actually makes it harder for its mlps to grow because it adds to their costs which is why investors might want to look at some better options making sense of energy transfer equity the following slide details the organizational structure of energy transfer equity once it closes its acquisition of williams companies later this year source energy transfer equity investor presentation the above chart makes it a bit more straightforward to understand energy transfer equity because its really an investment in its affiliated mlps at the moment this includes energy transfer partners nyseetp sunoco and sunoco logistics partners however there is more to the story here which is best left to the company to explain in one of its recent press releases energy transfer equity says that it owns the general partner and  of the incentive distribution rights idrs of energy transfer partners and sunoco approximately  million etp common units approximately  million etp class h units which track  of the underlying economics of the general partner interest and idrs of sunoco logistics partners and  etp class i units while thats pretty tough to comprehend what it means is that energy transfer equity is pulling fees from its mlps through a variety of different sources in one sense thats a pretty good deal for energy transfer equity however as ill show in a moment midstream companies that have a much simpler ownership structure have a big strategic advantage over this complex peer the onestop shops that simpler model is the standalone master limited partnership which includes midstream companies that have done away with the complexity of the general partner by acquiring this entity the top three in this category are enterprise products partners nyseepd magellan midstream partners nysemmp and buckeye partners nysebpl magellan midstream partners was the first in the group to simplify its structure after it acquired its general partner in  at the time the company said that the transaction would lower its costs of capital to make it more competitive for future acquisition and expansion opportunities as well as reduce the administrative costs associated with operating a second publicly traded entity it was followed the next year by buckeye partners and enterprise products partners both companies cited the lower capital costs theyd incur after buying out their general partners what these companies found was that paying out the general partner fees and incentive distribution rights were costing their investors a lot of money in the long run these fees to their general partners left them with not only less cash to pay their own investors but virtually no cash to reinvest into their businesses and fund growth projects instead they had to turn to the capital markets for this cash issuing more units or debt to raise the cash needed to fund growth investments this was not only really dilutive to current investors but increased the hurdle rate for future growth not only that but issuing debt and equity has become much harder to do in recent months because of the downturn in the energy market  today these companies actually have a competitive advantage over peers such as energy transfer partners that are still tied to their general partner because they dont need to access the capital markets quite as frequently thats clear from the following chart which shows a much slower growth rate for outstanding units etp average diluted shares outstanding quarterly data by ycharts further not only have all three issued far fewer units than energy transfer partners but each has grown their distributions by a rate thats at least as fast if not faster than energy transfer equitys namesake mlp this trio has also issued less debt because they are retaining more cash which has resulted in each maintaining an investment grade credit rating with enterprise products partners and magellan midstream both rated bbb and buckeye partners is bbb while energy transfer partners also owns an investment grade credit rating at bbb its at risk of being downgraded to below investment grade because of its weaker cash flow and coverage ratio below investment grade is actually where we find energy transfer equity it was slapped with a bb credit rating due to concerns over its debt in other words not only is the added complexity harder for investors to understand but it has acted as a financial weight on this organization investor takeaway energy transfer equity is one of the more complex energy companies because its the general partner to a growing number of mlps that adds a lot more work for investors and also makes it harder on its own mlps to compete investors who want to avoid this added complexity and all that goes with it should instead take a look at standalone mlps enterprise products partners magellan midstream partners and buckeye partners matt

flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted the partnership’s nongaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap financial measures such as net income cash flow from operating activities or any other gaap measure of liquidity or financial performance distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted the partnership defines distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted for a period as cash distributions expected to be received in respect of such period in connection with the partnership’s investments in limited and general partner interests net of the partnership’s cash expenditures for general and administrative costs and interest expense the partnership’s definitions of distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted also include distributable cash flow from lake charles lng to the partnership for distributable cash flow as adjusted certain transactionrelated expenses that are included in net income are excluded distributable cash flow is a significant liquidity measure used by the partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the partnership to the distributions the partnership expects to pay its unitholders due to cash expenses incurred from time to time in connection with the partnership’s merger and acquisition activities and other transactions distributable cash flow as adjusted is also a significant liquidity measure used by the partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the partnership to the distributions the partnership expects to pay its unitholders using these measures the partnership’s management can compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows for a period to planned cash distributions for such period distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted are also important nongaap financial measures for our limited partners since these indicate to investors whether the partnership’s investments are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distribution levels financial measures such as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted are quantitative standards used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is in part measured by its yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow as adjusted is net income for ete on a standalone basis the “parent company” distribution coverage ratio the partnership defines distribution coverage ratio for a period as distributable cash flow as adjusted divided by total cash distributions expected to be paid to the partners of ete in respect of such period  supplemental information financial statements for parent company following are condensed
