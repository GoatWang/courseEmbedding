last now what the soviet and chinese attempts to offer a roadmap for the postcolonial world jeremy friedman this article seeks to understand the motivations behind the peoples republic of chinas attempt to present an alternative development model for the postcolonial world and challenge soviet leadership in the international communist movement in mids when the wave of postwar decolonization crested in africa in the late s and early s inaugurating dozens of new states desperate for a political and economic model that would put flesh on the bones of independence the usa and ussr were eager to offer aid and advice to promote their own models the prc suffering the consequences of a centurylong tangle with imperialism and decades of war coupled with the effects of the great leap forward was in a distinctly disadvantageous position to compete with the two superpowers however it did compete and the question is why the existing historiography on the sinosoviet split focuses on maos desire for leadership of the international communist movement his contempt for khrushchev and his battle for control of the chinese communist party line this tends to render the chinese as the unpredictable aggressor and the soviets as playing a reactive game this article argues instead that the timing and nature of the chinese challenge reflect the reactive elements in the prcs own policy which was formulated largely in response to a perceived security threat resulting from the soviet policy of peaceful coexistence as well as soviet misunderstanding and neglect of the anticolonial

professor friedman devotes his research to the history of the left and its struggle to end economic and social inequality he studies how this struggle evolved its various cultural contexts and what paths have been tried and rejected he has been able to gain access to archival resources some no longer available to researchers and to study them in their original languages in his first book shadow cold war the sinosoviet competition for the third world professor friedman examines the different approaches taken by the soviet union and the people’s republic of china in their quest for influence in newly decolonized third world states after world war ii he is currently investigating how socialism played itself out in the political trajectories of five of these countries—indonesia tanzania chile angola and iran—from the late s to the s he explores the process by which actors in these countries as well as in the soviet union and china attempted to create a workable model of socialism for the developing world in this environment no one knew what “third world socialism” should look like so the lessons of each attempt to build it were studied and absorbed into the next one jeremy s
