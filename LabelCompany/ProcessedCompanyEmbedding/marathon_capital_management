advisors  infoinsidemarathoncom toggle navigation home about us our philosophy meet the team client services trends contact about us marathons philosophy our investment philosophy marathon capital management provides professional investment management services to individuals and small institutions investment programs are tailored to meet individual client needs within a disciplined investment framework considerate of risk tolerance capital preservation and longterm growth objectivesthe new millennium has ushered in a period of uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets with the advent of etfs electronic trading and algorithmdriven strategies investors are increasingly subject to forces beyond their control as markets move and react faster than ever before layer on leveraged balance sheets underfunded pension plans conflicts of interest on wall street and global debt concerns and is it any wonder that the average investor is overwhelmed if past is prologue these excesses will be cleansed from the system and create opportunity for investors with longterm time horizons our approach what all of this points to is the need to be disciplined in your investment approach realistic in your expectations and thoughtful as you make asset allocation decisions at marathon capital management we work closely with you to define investment objectives risk tolerance levels income needs tax considerations and other variables that help shape the longterm investment framework for achieving your goals as detailed in the following pages we encourage a longterm view of the capital markets and embrace a “growth at a reasonable price” equity investment philosophy simply stated we look for growth opportunities with reasonable valuations and believe that over time the markets will recognize and reward superior corporate performance for those investors who need current income or want to reduce their overall exposure to the equity markets we employ an income strategy that uses a variety of sources to meet your capital preservation and income requirements marathon capital managements equity philosophy is best described as growth at a reasonable price we believe the markets offer these opportunities in two forms undervalued growth companies and wellmanaged firms that for one reason or another have fallen outoffavor with wall street but still demonstrate attractive growth characteristics we concentrate on company fundamentals and avoid market timing and as longterm investors we focus on a threetofive year time horizon in searching for undervalued growth companies we look for several key characteristics including  experienced management with an ownership position we want to establish longterm positions in successful growing companies and consequently look for the same commitment from management through their direct equity ownership in the enterprise this alignment of management and shareholder commitment when coupled with industry experience strong fundamentals and expanding margins augurs well for superior performance and enhanced shareholder value  expanding revenue opportunities and industry leadership increasing demand is the critical fuel for growing enterprises we look for companies that are addressing an expanding market for their products and services and focus on firms that have superior offerings defendable niches or specific industry advantages we may not always own the largest company within an industry but we look for certain leadership characteristics that will enforce a growing presence within the marketplace  strong financials with low debt levels strong financial characteristics such as increasing returns on equity improving margins healthy current ratio and low debt levels are important in our analysis we are risk averse when it comes to balance sheet structure and prefer managements that employ debt and equity capital in a prudent accretive manner  attractive valuation based on fundamental and industry parameters while fundamental research dominates our investment process we look at prevailing interest rates and industry dynamics to determine relative levels of valuation such factors as pricesales ratio earnings yield private market value margin expansion revenue growth and industry comparables are used to determine acceptable buysell levels additional info when fully invested portfolios will typically contain  to  stocks with limits on industry concentration and individual equity position size our goal is to pay a reasonable price for a superior company and demonstrate the patience necessary to make prudent longterm investments for those investors who need current income or want to reduce overall exposure to the equity markets we deploy a variety of strategies to help meet income needs and capital preservation requirements the two primary risks associated with fixed income obligations are the market or maturity risk and the credit risk because we believe bonds should generate income and not volatility our emphasis is on investmentgrade instruments while avoiding highyield or junk bonds where investors are rarely compensated for the degree of risk assumed we look for attractive features such as call protection reasonable spreads vs treasuries and strong corporate balance sheets to help reduce risk and dampen volatility we will occasionally buy bonds of less than investment grade quality but only if were comfortable with the credit worthiness and business prospects of the underlying issuer we address market or maturity risk by focusing on the secular and cyclical components of the bond market and take positions accordingly the optimal time to increase duration is when both secular and cyclical forces are aligned toward declining yields conversely we want to avoid longterm major commitments when secular or cyclical yields are increasing we watch such trends as monetary currency trade and fiscal policy as well as the economic cycle to help determine our interest rate outlook fixed income plays an important role in balanced account management and we firmly believe that equities should be owned for capital appreciation while bonds should be held to generate income and preserve capital in accordance with client objectives our fixed income philosophy is risk averse and for smaller accounts we may use fixed income mutual funds to help achieve income goals balanced account management is for those investors who desire current income or reduced overall volatility in their portfolio holdings we work closely with each investor to determine the appropriate level for reserve funds fixed income and equities based on individual risk tolerance and investment objectives we emphasize the most basic distinction between fixed income and equities in balanced account management which is the recognition that equities should be owned for capital appreciation and not income while bonds should be held to generate income and preserve capital in accordance with client objectives each balanced account at marathon capital management has a written investment profile that details the appropriate percentage ranges for reserve funds fixed income and equities shifts in asset allocations are made within these ranges in order to preserve capital or increase returns as opportunities present themselves we continually refine our interest rate outlook to determine when capital should be moved into or out of fixed income investments likewise we want to own well managed financially sound companies in the equity portion of balanced accounts and therefore make commitments at opportune times and within prescribed asset allocation ranges ready to get started contact us contact  marathon capital management —

 anything anywhere anytime the digital age has ushered in more than just advanced technology the advent of wireless devices cloud computing virtual servers and applications blockchain and virtual reality technologies as well as ideas incubating at the university level and palo alto garages is changing society in myriad ways and at light speed these changes impact all facets of our daily lives from transportation communication and work environment to economics education and warfare such change and progress is accompanied by both opportunity as well as pitfalls investors will be challenged

belongs to the swift knowledgable and thoughtful no  climate change its causes may be up for debate but climate change is upon us and will impact investors for years to come changing weather patterns impact such things as food production infrastructure needs energy development migration water availability and transportation to name just a few these challenges will transcend economic considerations and spill over into the political security and human capital arenas expect the global discussion and debate to intensify as emerging economies assume a larger role in consumer consumption and energy production and use the latter will be front and center as such economies consider the pros and cons of generating power via nuclear coal oil gas solar and wind each of these sources have its selling points and challenges as well as distinct political considerations change is in the air  watch read listen and consider before investing no  global population according to united nations projections  represents a milestone  for the first time since  the worlds advanced economies will see a decline in their combined workingage populations the projections expect a  shrinkage by  essentially the byproduct of two long term trends increasing lifespans and decreasing fertility the resultant demographics will impact consumption employment income and growth for example as baby boomers head into retirement theres concern that certain occupations will suffer from both lack of qualified workers and the braindrain associated with such departures the absence of knowledge transfer from older to younger employees can impact companies as well as entire industries another example resides in consumption patterns generally shifting from consumption of goods to consumption of services like healthcare travel and downsized living arrangements experienced investors know that demographics are a powerful trend that can impact many industries going forward it should be noted that the us given the size of the millennial generation is well positioned in the long run as this large demographic asserts itself politically socially and economically no  government debt  taxes the  global financial meltdown resulted in an unprecedented level of monetary easing around the world our own feds balance sheet ballooned to over  trillion as japan and the european union joined the party additionally many state governments here in the us have taken on debt and pension obligations that will be challenging to digest add in the long term obligations of social security medicare and medicade and you begin to wonder how well pay for it all traditionally it has come from two sources taxation and borrowing were not sure where the marketdriven boundaries of the latter reside but suffice it to say that you cant borrow your way to prosperity without growth what this indicates to us is that taxes are headed higher which in turn will impact various industries as well as taxpayer behavior while not necessarily a bad thing higher taxes will have important implications in the years to come no  healthcare revolution when it comes to healthcare its the tale of two cities on one hand we are witnessing a healthcare revolution as we learn more about the human genome rna and its derivatives the role of proteins and the application of advanced technology to some of our thorniest challenges the age of individualized medicine is near and will usher in new understandings and therapies that were just pipedreams a short ten years ago while all of this is exciting and undoubtedly leads to investment opportunities as a country we are saddled with an antiquated healthcare delivery and payment system that is in need of serious reform efforts are underway but investors should not be naive about the political and entrenched industry obstacles to such reformation however the trend is inevitable and slowly gaining momentum to summarize both cities offer investment opportunities of varying degrees the former is chock full of richly valued companies grabbing for the brass ring while the latter has many new entrants that if successful will richly reward patient investors last but not least dont underestimate the power of the millennials born between  and 7 and some  million strong these digital natives are highly social determined to make the world a better place and operate on
