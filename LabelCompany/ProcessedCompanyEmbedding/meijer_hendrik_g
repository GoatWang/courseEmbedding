integrated prototypes for their rollouts one example was the whimsical design prototype introduced with the  expansion into indiana different shapes and roofing designs created the facade of the

also notable was the use of a large translucent wall above the grand concourse facing the registers this allowed natural light to filter into the area above the registers without actual windows

illinois and the  reentry into kentucky on august   the store in fort gratiot township michigan debuted a new prototype that evolved out of the mids prototype this was the presidential prototype in which the logo was moved to the center of the building later meijer stores of this design introduced the meijer fresh logo with the thencurrent meijer logo and a large cursive fresh on the right of the meijer name most of these signs have since been phased out in favor of the current logo with the lower case meijer in red with blue dots over the i and j in the year  the presidential prototype was replaced with the village square prototype which featured fake storefronts running across the front of the building and a barnlike section on which the meijer logo was situated that prototype however was soon replaced by the signature series prototype which removed the fake storefronts which itself was replaced in the mids with the current prototype which features emphasis on the entrances

that ran along the area between the entrances examples include many early locations in ohio and the midland michigan store many of these such stores have since been renovated into the current exterior design described below early in the s meijer developed new integrated prototypes for their rollouts one example was the whimsical design prototype introduced with the  expansion into indiana different shapes and roofing designs created the facade of the building most notable was the yellow pineapple constructed from yellow ceramic brick and glass blocks the different shapes on the facade were to introduce meijer to indiana as a store of discovery also notable was the use of a large translucent wall above the grand concourse facing the registers this allowed natural light to filter into the area above the registers without actual windows another feature of these stores was the introduction of grey concrete panels and silver framing on windows and doors slight variations of this prototype were also introduced with the  expansion into illinois and the  reentry into kentucky on august   the store in fort gratiot township michigan debuted a new prototype that evolved out of the mids prototype this was the presidential prototype in which the logo was moved to the center of the building later meijer stores of this design introduced the meijer fresh logo with the thencurrent meijer logo and a large cursive fresh on the right of the meijer name most of these signs have since been phased out in favor of the current logo with the lower case meijer in red with blue dots over the i and j in the year  the presidential prototype was replaced with the village square prototype which featured fake storefronts running across the front of the building and a barnlike section on which the meijer logo was situated that prototype however was soon replaced by the signature series prototype which removed the fake storefronts which itself was replaced in the mids with the current prototype which features emphasis on the entrances which feature towering glass walls with a tilted roof resulting in an eyebrow appearance hypermarketedit  renovated meijer store at store  grand

that ran along the area between the entrances examples include many early locations in ohio and the midland michigan store many of these such stores have since been renovated into the current exterior design described below early in the s meijer developed new integrated prototypes for their rollouts one example was the whimsical design prototype introduced with the  expansion into indiana different shapes and roofing designs created the facade of the building most notable was the yellow pineapple constructed from yellow ceramic brick and glass blocks the different shapes on the facade were to introduce meijer to indiana as a store of discovery also notable was the use of a large translucent wall above the grand concourse facing the registers this allowed natural light to filter into the area above the registers without actual windows another feature of these stores was the introduction of grey concrete panels and silver framing on windows and doors slight variations of this prototype were also introduced with the  expansion into illinois and the  reentry into kentucky on august   the store in fort gratiot township michigan debuted a new prototype that evolved out of the mids prototype this was the presidential prototype in which the logo was moved to the center of the building later meijer stores of this design introduced the meijer fresh logo with the thencurrent meijer logo and a large cursive fresh on the right of the meijer name most of these signs have since been phased out in favor of the current logo with the lower case meijer in red with blue dots over the i and j in the year  the presidential prototype was replaced with the village square prototype which featured fake storefronts running across the front of the building and a barnlike section on which the meijer logo was situated that prototype however was soon replaced by the signature series prototype which removed the fake storefronts which itself was replaced in the mids with the current

later became chairman of the company the current cochairmen brothers hank and doug meijer are hendriks grandsons after studying trends in the grocery industry meijer was among the first stores to offer selfservice shopping and shopping carts he also offered staple items such as vinegar at bargain prices the greenville store went successfully and additional meijer groceries were opened in ionia and cedar springs by the s the company had over two dozen stores located throughout west michigan in  the first two meijer stores opened in grand rapids michigan in a contest a customer suggests the name thrifty for meijers little dutch boy who becomes the corporate symbol for the next  years in  meijer launched its modern format with a store at the corner of th street and kalamazoo avenue in grand rapids at a size of  square feet  m it combined grocery shopping and department store shopping in a single large store the store was built with sixinch mm thick floors so should the concept fail the nongrocery half could be converted into an indoor car dealership new stores were built in the same manner until the mids when an architect mentioned the extra cost to management the second such store opened in norton shores later that year followed by two more in  one on alpine avenue in walker michigan and one on westnedge avenue in portage michigan this was followed by the first midmichigan location in delta charter township michigan in  and the first metro detroit store in ypsilanti michigan in  fred meijer took over the company upon his fathers death in  under his leadership the thrifty acres stores became a success and were renamed meijer in  meijers standalone grocery operations continued until the early s as the larger stores became dominant in  forbes

store in  opening only four stores the last in  an article in forbes magazine said meijer understood the importance of the food business and it was not something just tacked onto a discount store the quality of the produce is very important poorquality produce sold by walmart was the main reason for their lack of success by contrast surveys said then and now that meijer ranks high on produce quality this former meijer logo was first commissioned in  for the chains th anniversary and was used until july   with the increasing dominance of walmart throughout the country during the s and up to the present meijer is facing the effects of an intensely competitive retail industry in late  the company laid off  people from the corporate offices distribution centers and field offices a few months later in january  meijer laid off  employees and managerial staff leading to speculation that the company was losing profitability and market share a marketing professor dr ben rudolph of grand valley state university near meijers corporate headquarters lambasted this move saying they apparently blinked and that meijers decision was driven by panic continuing cutbacks in  the company outsourced  information technology positions to india in  the company announced that all new meijer stores would feature an entirely new format and company image complete with a new logo intended to make the meijer stores seem friendly and inviting the company hired new york citys rockwell group to redesign the existing stores and establish a design for new stores the new theatrics for the thenyearold company originally started as a new product introduction program until david rockwell talked hank and fred meijer into further changes rockwell told the meijers the new introduction program would work only if it was part of a new overall creative foundation based on a fresher younger approach encompassing architecture interior design and graphic design despite recent cutbacks

store in  opening only four stores the last in  an article in forbes magazine said meijer understood the importance of the food business and it was not something just tacked onto a discount store the quality of the produce is very important poorquality produce sold by walmart was the main reason for their lack of success by contrast surveys said then and now that meijer ranks high on produce

months later in january  meijer laid off  employees and managerial staff leading to speculation that the company was losing profitability and market share a marketing professor dr ben rudolph of grand

outsourced  information technology positions to india in  the company announced that all new meijer stores would feature an entirely new format and company image complete with a new logo intended to make the meijer stores seem friendly and inviting the company hired new york citys rockwell group to redesign the existing stores and establish a design for new stores the new theatrics for the thenyearold company originally started as a new product introduction program until david rockwell talked hank and fred meijer into further changes rockwell told the meijers the new introduction program would work only if it was part of a new overall creative foundation based on a fresher younger approach encompassing architecture interior design and graphic design despite recent cutbacks
