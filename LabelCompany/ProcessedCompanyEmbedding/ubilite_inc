internet ioe promises significant return on investment and new application opportunities for industrial automation asset tracking building control retail automotive home automation consumer mobile and wearables ioe uses the existing internet infrastructure but builds on connecting all devices at home office enterprise and public networks to the cloud enabling users to access the information and control devices remotely   ideally data communicated to and from ioe enabled things should integrate seamlessly with the current internet infrastructure the prevailing ubiquitous protocol layer that can seamlessly connect things to the internet is the ip protocol and  wlan however due to lack of ultra low power  wlan socs other less ubiquitous low power wireless connectivity solutions have been used to connect things thus restricting applications ubilite’s innovation ubilite inc is developing the lowest power  wlan soc on the market with a factor x better power consumption than comparable
