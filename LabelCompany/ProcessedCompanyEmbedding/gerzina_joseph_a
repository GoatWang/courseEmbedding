business magazine linkedin facebook twitter google youtube rss search for akroncanton foreign waters by kristen hampshire  am edt july   in today’s global marketplace us companies are doing business with more foreign customers who are reeling from the strength of their own currency relative to the us dollar as businesses here capture foreign demand for us goods and services  now more affordable for overseas companies than ever before  they may confront payment and financing issues there is inevitable risk associated with overseas sales primarily not getting paid but also securing the financing to produce the products to make the sale in the first place trade financing addresses both concerns “any company that exports overseas is a candidate for trade financing” says joseph gerzina senior vice president regional manager for the akroncanton region commercial banking group of huntington bank smart business spoke with gerzina about trade financing and how it can help us businesses prosper in a world economy what exactly is trade finance there are two parts to trade finance credit and structured payment the credit helps companies acquire and manufacture goods to sell when domestic funding sources are either insufficient or unavailable a us company can obtain trade finance credit to start and complete a transaction the structured payment assures that the company gets paid via documentary credits or collections that are dispatched through secure global banking communication networks what businesses are prime candidates for trade finance any company engaged in buying and selling raw material semifinished or finished goods both internationally and domestically can utilize trade finance for instance a us company receives a product order from a foreign customer but it has never done business with this customer before and therefore has no proof that the customer will pay or pay on time in this case the trade finance arrangement involves getting an export letter of credit or standby letter of credit from the foreign customer’s bank an export letter of credit is a standardized conditional promise to pay the seller when goods are delivered in compliance with the terms and conditions a standby letter of credit is more along the lines of a performance guarantee a business is also a candidate for trade finance if a foreign customer places a large order and the us company does not have the liquidity to produce the products to fulfill that order and get paid trade finance involves the lender securing shortterm payment guarantees via banker acceptances with an ‘aval’ guarantee from the foreign bank or bankers acceptances created under an export letter of credit or credit insurance provided by the private insurance market or insurance or credit guarantees obtained from the exportimport bank of the united states exim bank essentially by seeking outside payment guarantees the loan repayment risk is shifted to an investment grade foreign bank or insurance company or as in the case of the exim bank of the united states the federal government what are the terms of a trade finance arrangement trade finance loan structures are usually six months or less and utilize the buyer’s or the buyer’s bank’s promise to pay credit insurance to cover foreign receivables or credit guarantees from the exim bank these are means of collateral or guarantee that the loan used to fund the export transaction will be repaid the exim bank provides participating us financial institutions with different types of credit guarantees helping shift the risk of nonpayment away from the foreign or domestic buyer to the us government instead trade finance loans are shortterm ‘bridges’ to help us companies do business overseas with minimal risk why should an owner utilize trade finance rather than commercial finance commercial loan structures are used to fund the daytoday operations of a company or to purchase equipment and property they are longerterm and require a lot of collateral the problem is some companies that do business overseas have significant foreign accounts receivables which are typically not sufficient collateral for us banks trade finance utilizes a secure promise to pay from a third party in the case of credit guarantees from the exim bank generous advance rates against ‘wip’ raw materials finished goods or foreign accounts receivable can be obtained if there is a default on payment which would lead to a default on the loan the exim bank will ‘make good’ on the loan what questions will a trade finance officer ask an owner before facilitating the loan first the bank will determine all risk factors that underlie potential payment default the bank will want to know what country the buyer is in the bank’s knowledge of legal and banking systems in your buyer’s country will help identify political or economic factors that contribute to the risk of nonpayment your bank will also figure out the financial capability of the buyer and its bank so you can get paid and pay back the trade credit refusal by the buyer’s bank to guarantee payment via letter of credit or otherwise is a big red flag you’ll also have to prove that your company has requisite funding available to sell the product joseph gerzina is the senior vice president and regional manager for the akroncanton region commercial banking group
