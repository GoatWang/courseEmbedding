to cart product descriptionâ¼â² at first sight the word liberalism does not seem threatening in any way quite the reverse it is often associated with ideas like democracy freedom and generosity of spirit however there is something quite sinister about theological liberalism although not a welldefined term it usually refers to a belief system which rejects the orthodox view of the christian faith as set out in the bible and summarized in the churchs historic creeds and confessionsthis book traces the origin and development of theological liberalism and convincingly demonstrates what a dangerous and destructive thing it is to the christian church the author shows that a battle continues to rage today not between two varieties of true christianity but between truth and error light

Â contact speaker Â  introduction by susan witt executiveÂ director schumacher center for a new economics the name peter barnes has been a household word at the e f schumacher society since our formation in  in  peter organized a conference called âwho owns the landâ that both our board president robert swann and our chairman john mcclaughry described as the best conference they ever attended when john mcclaughry encouraged us to sponsor our first decentralist conference he said âyou know iâm really looking for the energy the vitality the historic content of that  conferenceâ so peter barnes and his legacy have been hovering over our heads since the beginning of the schumacher society peter barnes when he organized that conference was a reporter forÂ the new republic he was also an activist working on social and ecological issues following that period in his life he became an entrepreneur involved with solar energy products and then in the s he cofounded the working assets long distance telephone company the idea was to bring a social impulse into a capitalist structure it is a successful company from which he is now retired he is following his original impulse of love and concern for the commons in his bookÂ who owns the skyÂ and now in the state of the commons a paper youâll find out on the pamphlet table during the last year of his life bob swann was having trouble seeing it was a spatial memory loss and he could no longer read his favorite books but he had good friends who would read them to him the book he chose to have read to him three times in that year was peter barnesâsÂ who owns the skyÂ if bob were here he would be thrilled to see such a large group gathered on an issue he devoted his life to a concern for redefinition of our relationship to the land he would highly recommend to you our next speaker peter barnes Â  Â  i first encountered e f schumacher in  whenÂ small is beautifulÂ was published in the united states at that time i was a reporter forÂ the new republicÂ magazine and a friend told me iÂ hadÂ to read this book i did andâas we put it in those daysâi was âblown awayâ never before had i read a book by an economist that was so impassioned so literary so unafraid to challenge prevailing orthodoxy when i then reviewedÂ small is beautifulÂ forÂ the new republicÂ i wrote âi had never heard of e f schumacher before reading this book after reading it i am ready to nominate him for the nobel prize in economicsâ i still am schumacher wrote eloquently about many things for some people his most important contributions had to do with scale and appropriate technology for me rereading him thirty years later what stands out is his focus on permanence âfrom an economic point of viewâ he wrote âthe central concept of wisdom is permanence nothing makes economic sense unless its continuance for a long time can be projected without running into absurditiesâ one major problem with capitalism is that the market as schumacher noted âutterly disregards things which cannot be or have not been privately appropriated but are nonetheless an essential precondition of all human activity such as air water the soil and in fact the whole framework of living natureâ the result is that we humans are destroying our own nest and not onlyÂ ourÂ nest but the nest of all other creatures who share our planet the second large problem with capitalism isÂ inequality schumacher didnât dwell on this but another of my favorite writers tom paine did iâll come back to inequality and tom paine later today i want to look at these twin problems of capitalismâinequality and the lack of permanenceâthrough a new lens that lens is the commons why this particular lens let me back up and say that even before i read schumacher i had been struggling to understand the capitalist system in which we live first as a boy crunching numbers for my fatherâs books on the stock market then as a student of economics in college later as a journalist and a political activist and lastly for twenty years as a business person my main motive for being a business person was not to make a lot of money but to see how far the boundaries of capitalism could be pushed by working from within i think i have a pretty good understanding of capitalism by nowâboth its virtues and its flaws and i should say that iÂ likeÂ many aspectsÂ of capitalism i like the freedom the dynamism the creativity it unleashes i would never ever want to do away with the market as the primary engine of productivity yet while i appreciate the marketâs virtues and know the problems itÂ canÂ solve i also recognize those itÂ cannotÂ solve and those it inexorably makes worse in this latter category are the two very big problems i mentioned earlierâtragedies really of major proportion the destruction of ageold natural systems and the exacerbation of inequality among humans these are fundamental systemic flaws not something that can be fixed by patches here and there by stopping this or saving that by spending more on education or adding a few government regulations such reforms may make us feel better and may even be beneficial but they do not fundamentally change a system that disregards permanence and increases inequality by its very nature let me be clear about this any economic system whose core mathematical calculus is to maximize shortterm profit for a few is bound to create these results it is no accident that despite more than a century of nonsystemic reforms the great profitmaximizing naturedestroying wealthconcentrating juggernaut that modern capitalism is marches onÂ  the primary problem is the economic system itself and by that i mean not only the market but also everything that surrounds and interacts with the market it is the economic systemÂ as a wholeÂ that must be reprogrammedââupgradedâ if you will like a computer operating system but how whatâs wrong with the current operating system whatâs missing as iâve thought about this question from various perspectives the answer i have come to is this the missing piece the piece without which the market will never function properly is the commons it is that part of the whole system i want to draw your attention to today in many ways the commons is like the dark matter of the universe itâs everywhere but we donât see it the only economic matter we see is the kind that glistens with dollar signs in my mind the great challenge for the twentyfirst century is to make the commons visible to give it proper reverence and to translate that reverence into property rights and legal institutions that are on a par with those we currently give to private property if this challenge is met i think weÂ canÂ solve the problems of lack of permanence and of inequality while retaining what is best about capitalism Â  what is the commons it is important to distinguish betweenÂ aÂ commons andÂ theÂ commonsÂ aÂ commons is specific the playground down the street the housatonic river the boston commonÂ theÂ commons is an abstract concept similar toÂ theÂ market orÂ theÂ state it is the sum of thousands perhaps millions of individual commons today i will talk mostly aboutÂ theÂ commons as a concept representing the sum of many smaller commons what then is the commons there is no simple or obvious answer so let me wander around a bit before i offer a modern and i hope useful definition first of all the commons consists of stuff we share that is to say whether it is a street or a river or the air or the vast store of human knowledgeânone of these belongs to you or me or private corporations they are something we share in one way or another second the commons consists of stuff we inherit it is not made up of anything that you or i or some corporation makes one can present a very good case that if you make or invent something it should be your private property at least for a while this is an entirely appropriate way of rewarding people and businesses for value they create and risks they take but air and water and ecosystems and dna and language and legal as well as political institutions are not made by any individual or corporation they are gifts we inherit either from nature or from the collective efforts of millions of humansÂ  third the commons consists of stuff we must pass on to future generations just as we receive the commons as a gift so too we have a moral obligation to pass this gift on to our children in at least as good condition as we received it if we can add to it improve it so much the better at a minimum we must not degrade it and we certainly have no right to destroy it fourth theÂ kindsÂ of things that tend to be commons are not small they tend to be large and they tend to be spaces or systemsânatural systems or social systems within these spaces and systems there can be private pieces for example many pieces of the internet or of a watershed may be privately owned but the internet and the watershed as whole systems are commons and we share them the systems if not all the pieces are parts of the commonsÂ  and fifth let me dispel two myths that have obstructed clear thinking about the commons for many years one is the myth that all commons are inherently selfdestructive this myth is largely the result of a  essay called âthe tragedy of the commonsâ by the late biologist garrett hardin hardin assumed that there is basically only one kind of commons the unfenced pasture or waste dump with no management system areas to which individuals can add animals and wastes freely and at willÂ with no limitation as a result destructionÂ canÂ result what hardin overlooked is that there are many kinds of commons and many ways to manage them for example you can put a fence around a pasture or you can put a fence around a waste dump and charge a dumping fee you can have fishing and hunting limits and sell licenses there is no tragedy if a commons is treated properly the other myth is that a commons must always be free and open to anyone who wants to use it in an uncrowded world thisÂ wouldÂ be the ideal way to run a commons but in a crowded world such as the one we now inhabit we must not allow unlimited dumping into the air the water and the soil we must put limits on the uses of many of our commons on the noises we allow into the shared spaces around us on hunting and fishing cutting of trees posting of billboards we can charge tolls for parking on city streets for using congested highways and for driving into the center of cities such as london all these are legitimate management tools to protect and preserve different kinds of commons there are numerous reasons why the commons is so important we all know why the market is important it produces and distributes the vast array of goods and services that characterize our highconsumption society what the commons does for all of us is less obviousâin part i should note because the commons never advertises for most of human existence the commons suppliedÂ everyoneâs food water fuel and medicines people hunted fished gathered wild fruits and herbs collected firewood and building materials grazed their animals in common pastures and farmed on common lands in other words the commons was the source of basic sustenance this is still true today in many parts of the world and even in the city where i live san francisco there are people who fish in the bay not for sport but for food Â  the commons is the source of all natural resources and natureâs many replenishing services water air dna seeds topsoil fire electricity minerals wild animals domesticable animals edible plants healing plants solar energy wind energy water power forests rivers ultraviolet protection climate regulation biodiversity and much more these are all parts of the commons Â  the commons is our ultimate waste sink it recycles water oxygen carbon and everything else we excrete exhale and throw away it is the place where we store or try to store the toxic residues of our modern industrial system Â  the commons holds and disseminates humanityâs vast accumulation of science art customs and laws it is the seedbed of all human creativity as isaac newton said if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants without the open sharing of ideas there would be no religion science mathematics philosophy childrenâs games musical instruments dances jazz hiphop fashion sports democracy universities librariesâthe list goes on and onÂ  Â  the commons is essential to human communication we talk to one another with shared symbols and languages that are the living products of many generations most of the spaces we communicate throughâthe air that carries sound the visual environment we use for traffic signs and billboards the vast global web of wires and switches we call the internet the electromagnetic waves we use for radio tv and cell phonesâare parts of the commons Â  we use the commons whenever we travel from place to place whether by land water or air if we could not use the commons in this way we would be prisoners in our private homesÂ  Â  we rely on the commons for our sense of community the commons is the village tree the public square main street the neighborhood and the playground in addition to families itâs the glue that holds us together Â  now iâd like to speak about the history of the commons whichÂ is as old as the earth itself as i said a moment ago for most of human existence it wasâand for many still isâthe source of basic sustenance from a conceptual standpoint theÂ ideaÂ of the commons goes back hundreds of years the romans distinguished among three types of propertyÂ res privatÃ¦ res publicÃ¦Â andÂ res communes the first consisted of things capable of being possessed by an individual or family the second of things built and set aside for public use by the state such as public buildings and roads and the third of natural things used by all such as air water and wild animals this was codified in theÂ institutes of justinian the grand summation of roman law which said âby the law of nature these things are common to mankindâthe air running water the sea and consequently the shore of the seaâ in the united kingdom during the middle ages the commons were shared lands used by villagers for foraging hunting planting crops and harvesting wood in  the magna carta established forests and fisheries asÂ res communesÂ resources available to all in america four early statesâmassachusetts pennsylvania virginia and kentuckyâcalled themselves âcommonwealthsâ several states declared in their constitutions that natural resources belong to the people and that the government acts as the peopleâs trustee the pennsylvania constitution still contains the words âpennsylvanias public natural resources are the common property of all the people including generations yet to come as trustee of these resources the commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the peopleâ this in a nutshell is the good side of the history of the commons unfortunately there is a bad side a tragic side as well that is the long history of enclosure of the commons which began in eighteenthcentury england and continues to this day in america and almost everywhere in the world as andrew kimbrell said in his schumacher lecture a few years ago âitâs no longer just the enclosure of the lands itâs the enclosure of our genes itâs the enclosure of the seas itâs the corporate enclosure of virtually the entire living commonsâ enclosure is an oldfashioned word for privatization at first it meant privatization by the landed gentry today it means privatization by corporations either way it means that what once belonged to many now belongs to a few enclosure is usually justified in the name of âefficiencyâ and sometimes itÂ doesÂ result in efficiency gains but what also results from enclosure is the impoverishment of those who lose access to the commons and the enrichment of those who take title to it in other words enclosure widens the gap between those with incomeproducing property and those withoutÂ  Â  at this point having wandered around a little i am ready to offer a modern definition of the commons i say âmodernâ because i want to erase from our minds the antiquated notion of the commons as a pasture or a plot of land the most useful way to understand the commons today is asÂ the sum of all we inherit together and must pass on undiminished and more or less equally to our heirsÂ here i include nonhuman as well as human heirs another way of saying this is that the commons consists of that which nobody owns or which we all own togetherâin contrast to the market which consists of that which we own privatelyÂ  either way the economy as a whole system is divided between the market and the commons within the market part of the system is what we manage mostly for the shortterm monetary gain of a propertyowning class within the commons part of the system is what we manageâorÂ shouldÂ manage because we donât at the momentâfor the longterm enhancement of all living beingsÂ  economists politicians and the media have tended to focus almost exclusively on the market side of the economy even though the commons is just as important in fact the commons happens to be worth more even in crude dollar terms than the market but i donât want to get into beancounting here whatever their relative value the commons precedes the market and is the source of most that enters the market and the sink for all that leaves it to put this in visual terms we might say that the commons surrounds the market or more dynamically that the commons is the pond in which the fish of private property swim i like the fishinthepond image for a couple of reasons first it conveys the notion that both the market and the commons are living systems with constantly moving and interacting parts the pond is a soup of water air light heat currents nutrients and life forms the fish are active competitive creatures constantly on the move taking what they need from the pond growing excreting reproducing and dying this is pretty much how corporations operate second the pondandfish image points to a rather remarkable aspect of corporations unlike real fish or any other life form the corporation has no optimum or maximum size it can grow or presumes it can growÂ ad infinitumÂ without damaging the pond of course if we think about it this is an impossibility in any case the economic system as a whole has these two distinct sectors the commons and the market they have different rules and different guiding principles and the boundaries between these sectors shift over time for the past three hundred years this shift has been in one direction only the market has steadily expanded into the commonsÂ  what i am proposing is that from this moment forward we reverse that direction i believe this is not only absolutely necessary but eminently doableâif we put our minds to it in the rest of my lecture i would like to show how first though i need to say a bit more about the market and the stateÂ  Â  the market and the state in the minds of most economists the market floats in an unbounded universe it takes resources from this universe transforms them into products that can be profitably sold and returns all wastes into unlimited sinks if any particular resource runs out the market canâthanks to human ingenuityâreplace it with another because both sinks and resources with substitutions are unlimited this game can go on forever but as schumacher and many others have pointed out this view is a delusion it is a delusion not so much because we will run out of resources but because we will run out of sinks this exhaustion of sinks is most imminent somewhat surprisingly in the sky in the s schumacher warned that we would shortly run out of oil in fact there is still a fair amount of oil left in the ground and a great deal of gas and coal as well but long before we run out of fossil fuels we are going to use up the atmosphereâs capacity to safely absorb the wastes produced by burning themÂ  this is not the place to go into the details of climate change if you are interested you can read my bookÂ who owns the skyÂ my point here is that the atmosphere is not infinite it is a scarce and hence valuable economic resource it is also a commons that is being used by polluters for free and as a result itâs being turned into a sewer to put this into schumacherâs words because the market âutterly disregardsâ the air we are well on our way to melting the polar icecaps redirecting the gulf stream and radically altering life on earth this has to do with the problem of impermanence that the market by itself cannot solve let me now offer another way of thinking about the market iâm sure many of you have seen the classic disney movie âfantasiaâ in it thereâs a wonderful segment starring mickey mouse as the sorcererâs apprentice mickey is charged with cleaning up the workshop he thinks he can make his job easier by having the broom carry a bucket of water for him with a wave of his arms he gleefully directs the broom which then goes out of control in a panic mickey takes an ax and chops the broom into many pieces but each piece turns into a new broom carrying a new bucket and soon the entire workshop is engulfed by a raging flood only when the wise old sorcerer returns is the watery chaos brought under control in many ways the market is like those outofcontrol brooms it is populated by an army of corporations that are programmed like robots to maximize shortterm profit for the few no matter how you shout at them or chop them up they keep doing what they are programmed to do the sorcerer who knows how to stop them is nowhere to be found of course corporations do create useful products and jobs but the robotic calculus that drives them compels them to pay as little as possible for the resources they use and to shift as many costs as possible to othersâbe it workers taxpayers future generations or nature this happens daily automatically and on a massive scale with nobody able to stop it now the fact that corporations act like profitmaximizing robots shifting as many costs as possible to others is not a shocking revelation it has been pointed out repeatedly for at least one hundred years whatÂ isÂ new is that the accumulation of these externalized costs has reached the point where the biological integrity of our planet is in grave dangeri donât need to describe the indicatorsâextinction of species alteration of the climate accumulation of toxic chemicals degradation of forests oceans aquifers and wetlands etcâbecause you know them well my point is that this cannot go on much longer the problem we need to solveâand quicklyâis how to stop and indeed reverse this systematic carnage it is helpful to look at this problem through the lens of the commons iâve talked about enclosure and how for three hundred years the market has been privatizing everything it can get its hands on and iâve talked about externalization and how for roughly the same period of time the market has been dumping wastes and unpaid costs into the commons in effect what has been going on is a relentless twopronged assault by the market on the commons with one hand the market takes good stuffÂ fromÂ the commons with the other hand it dumps bad stuffÂ intoÂ the commons if someone were keeping a balance sheet of our common wealth it would not look good part of the problem is that no one is keeping such a balance sheet which is quite odd given that doubleentry bookkeeping was invented in the sixteenth century every economist and business person knows that one personâs income is another personâs expense and that liabilities for the most part offset assets yet when it comes to keeping doubleentry books for the market and the commons as a whole we simply donât do that a bigger part of the problem is that the contest between the market and the commons has not been an even one itâs been like a world series between the new york yankees and the portland sea dogs one side has all the money the top hitters and the best pitchers it also i might add pays the umpires sports metaphors aside it is extremely important to understandÂ whyÂ the market is so much stronger than the commons there are multiple reasons to be sure but there are two that i would like to highlight today one has to do with lawâor more precisely with property rights the second has to do with institutions Â  divine right letâs look first at property rights marjorie kelly has written a brilliant book calledÂ the divine right of capitalÂ by âdivineâ she doesnât mean godgiven although there are indeed some apologists for capitalism who attribute the current design of our economy to the almighty what she means is that under the current laws of our land the rights of capital trump everything else the rights of employees the rights of communities the rights of nature and the rights of future generations are all subordinate to the right of capital to maximize shortterm profit for the few this primacy of capital is embedded not only in state and federal law but also in international treaties such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north america free trade agreement nafta thus a california company sun belt water wanted to export water from canada in supertankers and sell it to southern californians canada said no so the company sued canada for billions of dollars in damages claiming that under nafta its right to make a profit trumped canadaâs right to protect its natural resources now the question of who gets the divine right in any society is always an interesting one because i have a fifteenyearold son who is learning to drive i read the california driversâ manual the other day and came across the following rule âat an intersection yield to the car which arrives firstÂ orÂ to the car on your right if it reaches the intersection at the same time you doâ why does the car on the right trump the car on the left itâs unclear quite possibly the rule is entirely arbitrary butÂ someoneÂ has to have the right of way or cars will collideÂ the same is true for boats at sea and for moving objects in any complex system someone has to be âking of the roadâ so too in a market economy when two property rights come to the same intersection one has to trump the other either capital can trump labor or labor can trump capital either my right to pollute trumps your right not to be polluted or vice versa one of the conflicting property rights you might say has to be the divine right but which one invariably those who hold the divine right in any era say there isÂ no choice they are the only conceivable holders of this right kings said it three hundred years ago capital owners say it today kings hired priests to lend moral credence to their claims whereas capital owners now hire economists to lend âscientificâ credence toÂ theirÂ claimsthe truth is though that weÂ doÂ have a choiceÂ societyÂ chooses the divineright holder and its choice can change over time bear in mind that even if we arenât talking literally about divinity weÂ areÂ talking about reverence reverence doesnât come from âup thereâ it comes from âin hereâ today despite all our speechifying about family values god and nature we in the west revere capital above all that is why we give it trumping rights in our economyâindeed that is why we call our economic system âcapitalismâ if we were to revere the commons as fervently as we currently revere capital our divine right would shift to bring our discussion back to the problems of impermanence and inequality it seems to me that if anything is divine it ought to be those things we inherit together and should pass on undiminished and more or less equally to future generations permanence should trump impermanence broad benefit should trump narrow benefit the commons should trump capital from an historical perspective the explosion of the market over the past three hundred years has been a logical response to the problem of scarce goods and services it makes perfect sense that during this time capital held the divine right so that it could efficiently flood the world with goods and services but now we humans as the dominant imperial species are approaching what schumacher called âthe tolerance limits of natureâ today our problem at least in the west is not the scarcity of goods and services itâs the scarcity of nature and of equity time and quiet therefore it makes historic sense that the divine right in modern postindustrial economies should shift to the commons of course this is easier said than done i can think of only one american lawâthe endangered species actâthat gives precedence to permanence over transience to the commons over capital the endangered species act says that the right of a species to survive trumps the right of capital to shortterm profit the trouble is that the law comes into play onlyÂ in extremisÂ when a species has been so decimated that it is on the brink of extinction the more general situation is not just that capital trumps the commons but that the commons has no rights at all protections for private property are enshrined in our constitution whereas the notion that there evenÂ isÂ such a thing as the commons is still in its infancy i want to add two more thoughts about legal rights here the first is that there is a difference between human rights and property rights human rights include the rights to life liberty speech and so on property rights involve the power to own control and sell things to limit other peopleâs use of them and to charge prices for using them there may also be a third class that of nonhuman rights such as those proposed by thomas berry this morning i want to be clear that what iâm talking about today is property rights recognizing that these property rights have significant implications for human and nonhuman rights the other point i want to make about property rights involves one of the more original economists of the twentieth century ronald coase coase worked with milton friedman at the university of chicago and is considered a conservative a nobel prize winner he is most recognized for his theorem that pollution can be reduced more efficiently through property rights than through government regulation one aspect of coaseâs argument is that if pollutees are given the rightÂ notÂ to be polluted they can bargain in the market with polluters and the end results will be that a polluters will pay pollutees a price based on how much pollution the pollutees are willing to accept as well as how badly the polluters want to pollute and b there will consequently be less pollution he also argued that the propertyrights approach would work just as well if polluters are given the right to pollute and pollutees pay themÂ notÂ to pollute he was strangely indifferent to the question of who should get the initial property rights and who should pay whom coaseâs theorem became the basis for socalled âcapandtradeâ programs such as the trading of sulfur dioxide initiated in the s to reduce acid rain these programs which are now fairly popular as ways of reducing pollutionÂ are generally supported by business because they allow polluters to figure out the cheapest ways to reduce pollution unfortunately they have thus far been set up with the initial property rights given free to polluters the economic result is that billions of dollars have been paid by pollutees to polluters how does this work well economists have a concept called âscarcity rentâ scarcity rent is like a bonus that owners of something in high demand collect from other people just because of scarcity theÂ mona lisafor example has a high scarcity rent because there is only one it is in great demand in general the scarcer things areâsuch as buildable land barry bonds homerun balls and new york taxi medallionsâthe higher the bonus for scarcity as opec or any other cartel knows when you restrict supply you can raise prices and profits sometimes by huge amounts what happens when we set up a capandtrade system and give the initial property rights to polluters first of all we reduce pollution which is good secondly we raise the price of polluting currently at zero this is also good and thirdly we raise the prices of all goods and services now made with expensive polluting processes this too is appropriate but think about who gets to keep the extra money we pay for these goods if polluters are given scarce pollution rights for free then we the ultimate consumers and pollutees end up paying scarcity rent to them forever imagine that because a corporation polluted in the past it gets free money forever over the long term this would be an enormous transfer of wealth to shareholders of historically polluting corporations iâll come back to this question of who gets initial property rightsâpolluters or polluteesâin a minute the other reason the commons is much weaker than the market in addition to the supremacy of capitalâs rights is institutional imbalance as i noted earlier the market is populated by aggressive profitmaximizing robots armed with property rights money lawyers and lobbyists the commons by contrast is institutionally threadbare there is no institution that âownsâ the sky or the housatonic river watershed and that can say to a corporation âstop this is common property you canât trespass here for freeâ there are just a handful of institutions whose mission is to preserve common assets for the future and who have the property rights needed to carry out that mission this institutional imbalance means that the commons is essentially defenseless against the ceaseless aggression of the market this brings us to the subject of the role of the state in defending the commons the first point we need to be clear about is thatÂ the state is not the commons the state is the state and the commons is the commons americans often get confused about this because so much land in our country is stateowned in theory these public lands areÂ partÂ of the commons but at best they are a small part and the mere fact that the stateÂ ownsÂ them in no way guarantees that they will be managed as the commons should be managed quite the contrary the state more often than not has been a coconspirator with private industry in managing public lands for shortterm profit rather than longterm preservation the u s forest service for example has spent billions of tax dollars building logging roads in national forests it then sells logging rights to private companies for less than private landowners do similarly grazing and mineral rights on federal lands are sold for a song and the public airwaves that carry radio and tv signals are given free to giant media conglomerates owned by disney general electric and rupert murdoch there is a legal principle called the public trust doctrine that i should mention here this principle arose from common law though it is embodied in several state constitutions such as pennsylvaniaâs the public trust doctrine holds that natural resources belong to the people rather than to the state and that it is the stateâs responsibility to act as trustee of these resources for present and future generations if the state doesÂ notÂ act as a trustee should the people have the right to hire another trustee the principle of trusteeship is very important and iâll come back to it shortly suffice it to say here that a private trustee who gives away entrusted assets would be sued fired and probably sent to jail but this rarely happens when the state is trustee as for the public trust doctrine itself the difficulty is similar to the difficulty with the endangered species act it comes into play onlyÂ in extremis afterÂ a state has failed to protect a resource in such cases citizens can sue the state and a court can order the state to remedy its breach of the public trust but it costs millions of dollars to bring such a suit and needless to say it is seldom done for this reason despite its sound philosophy the public trust doctrine is an inadequate tool for defending the commons against the everyday assaults of the market of course if the state were acting as a proper trustee of the commons in the first place lawsuits under the public trust doctrine would be unnecessary which brings us to three critical questions what is the role of a commons trustee why has the stateÂ notÂ been a good commons trustee if the state isnât a good commons trustee whoÂ canÂ be Â  the role of trusts when we think of capitalist institutions the one that immediately comes to mind is the corporation but there is another institution that is as old and as firmly established as the corporation and that is the trust the essence of a trust is a fiduciary relationship ie one that is based on the beneficiaryâs confidence in the trustee a trustee holds and manages property for another person or for many other people a simple example is a trust established by a grandmother so that her grandchildren will have money to go to college she then appoints a trustee a bank for example which by law has a fiduciary responsibility to manage the assets on behalf of the beneficiaries and to assure that the trustâs purpose is achieved other trusts include pension funds charitable foundations and university endowments the rules of trust management which are defined by state statutes and by centuries of case law d following managers must act with undivided loyalty to beneficiaries if a manager fails this obligation she can be removed and penalized in most cases managers must preserve the principal it is acceptable to spend incomeÂ Â but it is not acceptable to invade the corpus if the beneficiaries of a trust span many generations the trustee may not favor one generation over another managers must assure transparencyÂ Â information about money flows must be readily available to beneficiaries these rules are enforceable by the courts the basic mechanism is that an aggrieved beneficiary can bring suit against a trustee and the trustee must then prove that she acted prudently to carry out the mandate of the trust this is in contrast to the state the government can give away whatever it wants with impunity there is no legal recourse except on rare occasions the politicians have a free hand if we were to design an institution to protect pieces of the commons we couldnât do much better than a trust the goal of commons management after all is to preserve assets and deliver benefits to broad classes of beneficiaries that is what trusts accomplish what then can we say about the stateâs capacity to serve as a commons trustee in theory the state represents all citizens equally and should be able to protect our common assets but in reality the track record of the state as trustee of the commons has been far from exemplary there are at least five reasons for this the elected officials who run the state do not have a longterm perspective just as corporate leaders are focused on the next quarterly statement political leaders are focused on the next election they like to please constituents here and now not worry about future generations Â  elected officials alas need money to get reelected it is tempting to trade common assets for private campaign contributions Â  elected officials are not accountable to beneficiaries in the same way private trustees are they can give assets away with virtual impunity whereas private trustees because of their fiduciary responsibility cannot Â  the state and its leaders have many other things to do besides manage common assets itâs easy for this task to get neglected Â  the stateâs finances are huge and complex all sorts of funds are commingled itâs extremely difficult for the public to track money from common assets or to ascertain whether these assets are being well managed many of my liberal friends get nervous when i make these arguments they think iâm aiding and abetting those conservatives who believe the state is always incompetent and the market is always right so let me be clear that this isÂ notÂ what iâm saying at heart i am an old new deal liberal i believe in limiting corporate power and in achieving a fairer distribution of income and property but i am a pragmatist when it comes to theÂ meansÂ to achieve these ends i think the state is good at some things and not good at othersÂ  when it is a matter of defending the commons the stateÂ doesÂ have a critical role to play that role is not to own and manage the commons directly but to assign common property rights to nurture the commons with as much vigor as it nurtures the market and to maintain a healthy balance between the commons and the market the problem today is that the state has abandoned this balancing role and has become a singleminded champion of the market this is what we must change Â  rebuilding the commons as i see it the great task of the twentyfirst century is to build a new and vital common sector that can resist enclosure and externalization by the market protect the planet and share the fruits of our common inheritances more equitably than is now the case just as the market is populated by profitmaximizing corporations so too the common sector needs to be populated by commonspreserving trusts these trusts should be endowed with property rights that are equal to those of corporations their beneficiaries should be all citizens equally as well as future generations and at times the larger biotic community their trustees and managers should be legally accountable to these beneficiaries and their finances should be completely transparent there are many models for such trusts including community land trusts which were pioneered by bob swann the founder of the schumacher society and susan witt its executive director but before i turn to these models i need to lay out a few general principles for commons management commons managers must first and foremost protect shared assets for the long term they must also assure that the benefits flowing from the assets are widely shared beyond these basic principles specific rules for commons management will vary from one commons to another broadly speaking they depend on theÂ level of useÂ society wishes to allow or encourage and here there are three distinct categories roughly comparable to situations where we want either no parking free parking or paid parking if we want a commons to be off limits to all but the most noninvasive useâa wilderness area for exampleâthe guiding rule is âno parkingâ or âno trespassingâ this is quite straightforward if a commons has no physical limits on use as with the internet or the cultural commons the guiding rule is âfree parkingâ or âthe more the merrierâ use should be as free as possible and managementâs main job should be to minimize private toll booths this too is relatively straightforward at least conceptually if not politically the third category is the most complex and also the most prevalent this is the category of commons that can be used up to a point but not infinitely fisheries rivers aquifers forests the atmosphere congested highways and crowded streets are examples managementâs job is to encourage efficient use and prevent overuse in economic terms its challenge is to live from income without diminishing capitalÂ  interestingly thereâs an old commonlaw principle that is relevant here called the âriparian principleâ it used to apply to rivers and streams in england and early colonial america the riparian principle says that water can be used but not owned by those adjacent to it so long as the usersÂ donât diminish the resource for others in other words you can take from the commons as long as you donât deplete or pollute itÂ  unfortunately the riparian principle was displaced in america by the âprior appropriationâ ruleâthat is perpetual property rights belong to whoever takes water first and there is no limit to what an appropriator can take with this kind of property regime itâs no surprise that america is the most profligate waterusing nation in the world by far in managing commons where some use is permissible but unlimited use is not itâs often desirable to set a limit on total use and charge users a fee such limits and prices assure preservation let markets sort out competing uses and generate revenue for many potentially good purposes it is crucial that a trust representing the commons not a private polluter collect the scarcity rent resulting from setting usage limits setting usage limits can be controversial if the physical threshold is uncertain as it usually is a critical question arises âwhich side should we err onâ under the precautionary principleÂ if the potential harm from overuse is substantial for example the polar icecaps might melt the usage limit should be set with safety as the primary guide as lawyer and ethicist carolyn raffensperger has stated âthe precautionary principleâs fundamental idea is that we prevent problems rather than clean them up afterwardâ the process of protecting and sustaining a commons involves several steps the commons must first be identified then given legal standing and an institutional infrastructure in some cases usage limitations and new kinds of property rights may be necessary it may also be necessary to appoint trustees and acquire preexisting property rights once a commons is identified given property rights and provided with a proper management regime markets can come into play profitmaximizing corporations which in the past could freely take from or dump into the commons will now have to deal with property managers who can limit their use and make corporations pay for previously externalized costsÂ  there is one last principle i should mention and that is the âpolluter paysâ principle this principle has been endorsed by virtually every economist in the world and the reason for it should be obvious it would make a huge difference if this principle were actually built into the economyâs operating system the costs of burning fossil fuels bleaching with chlorine spraying with pesticides longdistance transport and many other commonsdiminishing processes would instantly rise thereby making clean energy recycling local organic food production and other commonssustaining processes immediately more competitiveÂ  yes prices for many things we buy would also rise but if the money that polluters pay is recycled back to commons owners which means to all of us consumers would on average not be penalized whatâs more if the dividends are equal consumers who switch to less polluting products will come out aheadâthat is their dividends will exceed what they pay in higher prices by contrast those who use the most polluting products and consequently make the most use of scarce common sinks will pay for that privilegeâthat is their higher costs will exceed their dividends in short total pollution will decrease the right kind of individual behavior will be rewarded and money will flow from overusers of the commons to underusers which usually translates into âfrom rich to poorâ all this through just a slight tweaking of property rights no new taxes or government bureaucracy requiredÂ  the chart below summarizes this discussion of commons regimes and rulesÂ  Â  modern commons regimes Â  open accessÂ  free parking zero access Â no parking limited

shift now from what has been a fairly abstract argument to concrete examples many of these are mentioned in the report i coauthoredÂ the state of the commons Â these models are examples of existing institutionsâtrusts in one form or anotherâthat preserve and manage property on behalf of broad classes of beneficiariesÂ  state land trustsÂ have been around since  when congress required western territories to set aside land for âcommon schoolsâ today over  million acres are held in trust by states much of this land is leased for timber grazing or oil production with revenues going to public schoolsÂ  the texas permanent school fundÂ owns submerged lands along the gulf coast proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases launched the fund in  earnings from investments go to local schoolsÂ  the alaska permanent fundÂ launched in the sÂ is like a communal savings account for all alaskans initial capital came from oil leases on state land and was put into a trust for the benefit of the citizens of alaska today a  billion diversified portfolio pays a yearly dividend to every alaskan man woman and child equally last yearâs dividend was  the marin agricultural land trustÂ buys conservation easements from farmers through the use of private and public funds farmers continue to own and operate their farms but they canât develop the land because the trust owns the development rights in perpetuity trustowned easements preserve the shared landscape and the farm economy the pacific forest trustÂ buys conservation easements from private forest owners the owners can continue to harvest trees sustainably but they cannot overcut and development is not permitted the oregon water trustÂ acquires previously allocated water rights and uses them to augment the flow of rivers and streamsÂ  the edwards aquifer authorityÂ which manages the aquifer from which san antonio texas gets its waterÂ limits withdrawals of underground water and sells tradable withdrawal permits the music performance trust fundÂ was formed in  by the recording industry and the musiciansâ union a small percentage of record sales goes into a fund that pays for free concerts in schools parks and hospitals sales of corporate products thus support living cultureÂ  the last model i want to mention doesnât exist yet but i fervently hope it comes into being during my lifetime it is theÂ sky trustÂ that i describe in my bookÂ who owns the skyÂ the sky trust which is based on the premise that the sky belongs to everyone and must be held in trust for future generations provides an example of how to take a huge commons the atmosphere and manage it from the standpoint of preservation and equity it requires polluters to purchase emission permits from a trust representing all citizens the trustâs income can be used for public purposes andor be rebated to citizens through equal dividends in the manner of the alaska permanent fund a study by the congressional budget office found that of all capandtrade systems that might be used to reduce carbon emissions the sky trust would be the easiest to implement would have the most positive effect on household incomes and would result in the lowest overall cost to society a key point here involves the assignment of initial pollution rights this is not just an abstract philosophical question because carbon is so pervasive in our economy literally trillions of dollars are at stake and the choice must be made whether this money should flow from pollutees to polluters or viceversa itâs a case where âdivine rightâ is worth a great deal of money some of the sky trustâs principles are embodied in the mccainlieberman bill called the climate stewardship act which is coming to a vote next week our president will surely veto the bill if it should pass but i consider its reaching the senate floor a significant step toward a rational and equitable climate policy the bill received  votesâed i mention these models for two reasons first to show that itâs possible to design modern institutions that can preserve and share a valuable commons and second to paint a picture of what the twentyfirst century could look likeÂ  in the twentyfirst century i envision there would be a large common sector populated by thousands of trusts like those i have mentioned the trusts would be as powerful as corporations are today they would act as protectors for various commons or to put it slightly differently as proxies for externalities that markets currently ignore they would have property rights management money and beneficiariesâin short as much power as the corporations that now populate the market the primary engine of productivity would still be profitmaximizing corporations and the market but this engine would now be tempered by automatic balancing mechanisms like the governors in james wattâs steam engines so that they couldnât run rampant the way they do nowÂ Â there would also be a kind of common property that disperses income equally as well as private property that disperses income unequally the key features of the two types of property appear in the table below Â  Â  private common transferable yes no universal birthright no yes expires at death no yes beneficial ownership  dollar  share  person  share voting rights  dollar  vote  person  vote future generations no stake legal stake nonhumans no stake legal stake  management goal maximize shortterm profit preserve assets basic management entity corporation trust main income source corporate profits commons rents  fees pays dividends yes yes sometimes  per share payments that vary from year to year depending on performance some but not all commons trusts would pay dividends the multiple benefits of this enlargement of property rights would consist of great advances in permanence in democracy in popular as opposed to corporate culture and in economic equality the stateâs main job in all this is to redraw the boundaries between the commons and the marketâto create new commonproperty rights shift the divine right from private property to common property and make it nearly as routine to form and empower commonspreserving trusts as it is to form and empower profitmaximizing corporations in addition some of the new commons trusts might be quasipublic like the social security trust fund and the alaska permanent fund to which elected officials appoint some or all of the trustees Â  inequality finally iâd like to talk about tom paine and the problem of inequality the perpetuation of inequality is built into the current design of capitalism because of the skewed distribution of private wealth a small selfperpetuating minority receives a disproportionate share of americaâs nonlabor income if the inheritance tax is completely repealed as george bush and most republicans want we will truly have recreated a permanent aristocracy of wealth one of the feudal privileges the american revolution sought to end tom paine was an amazing man who lived an amazing life he was born in england when the commons was being enclosed came to america and participated in the revolution here then moved to france in time to join the revolution there in one of his greatest essays âagrarian justiceâ written in  he argued that because enclosure of the commons had separated so many people from their primary source of sustenance it was necessary to create a functional equivalent of the commons in the form of a national fund here is how he put it there are two kinds of property firstly natural property or that which comes to us from the creator of the universeâsuch as the earth air water secondly artificial or acquired propertyâthe invention of men in the latter equality is impossible for to distribute it equally it would be necessary that all should have contributed in the same proportion which can never be the case     equality of natural property is different every individual in the world is born with legitimate claims on this propertyÂ or its equivalent emphasis added enclosure of the commons he went on was necessary to improve the efficiency of cultivation but âthe landed monopoly that began with enclosure has produced the greatest evil it has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their natural inheritance without providing for them as ought to have been done an indemnification for that loss and has thereby created a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist beforeâ the remedy he proposed was a fund remarkably similar to the alaska permanent fund except that it was financed not with oil revenue but with ground rents paid by landowners out of this fund there would be paid to every person reaching twentyone years of age the sum of fifteen pounds sterling the equivalent of several thousand dollars today âas a compensation in part for the loss of his or her natural inheritanceâ an additional sum of ten pounds per year would be paid to every person over age fifty an idea that foreshadowed social security this essay written  years ago could not be more timely today surely from our vast common inheritanceânot just the land but the atmosphere the broadcast spectrum our mineral resources our threatened habitats and water suppliesâenough rent can be collected to pay every american over twentyone a modest annual dividend and every person reaching twentyone a small startup inheritance and remember what i said earlier about scarcity rent the more we restrict use of the commons the more dividends we can pay so there is a double benefitÂ  if this sounds dangerously communistic consider the familiar board game monopolyÂ Â the capitalist gameÂ par excellenceÂ with players buying and selling property and trying to build monopolies but monopoly has two rules that make it very different from capitalism as we know it today first all players receive an equal amount of startup capital nobody starts off either penniless or inheriting boardwalk or park place and second all players receive an equal dividend every time they complete a trip around the board or consider professional sportsâthe profitseeking leagues of baseball football and basketball each has a set of rules designed to shift money from the richest teams to the poorest and to give the losing teams first crack at the best new players these businesses have learned that too much inequality hurts everyone the rules of monopoly and professional sports in no way inhibit the vigor of the market indeed they make the market stronger by making it fairer and more competitiveÂ  in a postmodern overproductive economy like americaâs there is absolutely no reason why every baby should not be a trustfund baby commonsfunded inheritances and commonsfunded dividends would strengthen our market economy in addition they would correct the two systemic flaws i spoke of at the beginning on the one hand by limiting commons usage they would diminish pollution and the destruction of nature on the other hand by distributing commonproperty income to everyone they would partially offset the maldistribution of privateproperty income the commons would again be a source of sustenance for all as it was in preenclosure days now if there are any economists in the audience iâd like to engage you in a thought experiment i want you to think about incentives right now there is a huge incentive to pollute because a itâs free to do so and b no one profits if youÂ reduceÂ pollution but imagine a system in which pollution sinks are commonly owned through trusts these trusts sell a finite number of pollution permits for whatever the market will bear and every american receives a dividend from these trustsâone person one share the trustees have the power to decide how many permits to sell leaving aside all ecological and legal issues such as the trusteesâ fiduciary responsibility to future beneficiaries my economic question is twofold under what circumstances should the trustees sellÂ moreÂ permits and under what circumstances should the trustees sellÂ fewerÂ permits just so no one feels left out hereâs another thought experiment for anyone with a little business sense imagine that all the critical ecosystems in the worldâthe oceans the atmosphere forests rivers watersheds and so onâare owned by one large holding company called gaia inc which itself is owned by shareholders on a one person one share basis each ecosystem is managed by a separate company but all are coordinated by the global holding company each ecosystem manager has the legal right to charge scarcity rent for limited human or corporate use of that ecosystem the business question is if gaia inc wants to maximize dividends to its shareholders what strategy should it pursue hint think of gaia inc as a cartel like opec whose asset isnât oil but vital ecosystems itâs important to be clear about what i amÂ notÂ suggesting iâm not suggesting that we abolish the market or change its fundamental calculus quite the contrary i strongly believe weÂ needÂ a sector of the economy that is driven by shortterm profit maximization for the few we need it for productivity for creativity for vitality and for freedom what iÂ amÂ saying is that we should not confuse the calculus of the market with the calculus of our entire society as a society we have values that differ from those embodied in the market therefore the calculus of the market needs to be balanced by other calculi other property rights and boundaries limits of nature need to be respected as do the interests of future generations those without private property and nonhuman species within this frameworkâand i would argueÂ onlyÂ within this frameworkâthe market can flourish indefinitely itâs important to note that under this sort of economic operating system the rules of the market will still be as they are today ceos will not have to change their consciousness businesses will not have to learn new tricks they will still be driven by profit maximization the bottom line will still be the bottom line the big difference from a business point of view is that costs which are routinely externalized today will instead be routinely internalized nature and future generations will be represented in realtime transactions and money from these transactions will flow to a broad set of âownersâ whose added purchasing power will spur economic activity it will be claimed that this new operating system in which the market and the commons are on a roughly equal footing will reduce gross domestic product depress the stock market and cost millions of jobs washington think tanks will busily grind out studies âprovingâ this my response would be to look at the city of washington itself there is a height limit no building can be taller than the capitol this limit enhances the cityâs beauty without in any way impoverishing its economy the same will be true when we put limits on other kinds of economic activity especially if we recycle the commons scarcity rents equitably markets and businesses and workers will do just fine more importantly humans as a whole and other speciesÂ will do much better conclusion my generationâthe generation born in the midtwentieth centuryâhas had a grand party we have consumed more resources and created more environmental destruction than all previous generations combined we are leaving behind one horrendous mess for our children but we havenât departed quite yet we still have time to leave a legacy the question i often ponder is âwhat can my generationâs legacy beâ the species we have exterminated can never be revived the harmful chemicals we have deposited in the biosphere cannot be removed in our lifetime the forests and wetlands weâve destroyed will take a long time to heal i wish we could summon a sorcerer who with a wave of the hand could put an instant end to the chaos weâve unleashed because that is not going to happen the best legacy we can leave it seems to me is a blueprint for incorporating permanence and greater equality into our runaway economic system i think this can be done my remarks today are an attempt in that direction i think we have the ingenuity and the tools to do it the basic tools are familiar property rights trusts limits prices and dividends we also have some timetested principles to guide us the riparian principle the polluterpays principle the precautionary principle and the centuriesold notion of the commons we can extend the principle of one person one vote to one person one share we can redraw the boundaries between the commons and the market and we can shift the divine right in whole or in part from private to common propertyÂ  it will of course take decades to build a strong common sector but at least we can see where we should be going and how we can get there from hereâone step toward reverence for the commons at a time one legal precedent at a time one institution at a time i propose that we start nowÂ  Â  Â  question  answer period i appreciate the creativity of your concept of building a counterforce to the market what i miss in your analysis is a closer look at the market per se iâm not suggesting that the market is in every instance a bad thing but i would distinguish for example between the family farm and the corporate farm as i believe e f schumacher would i would also like to have you consider how much effort should be made toward a death penalty for corporate malfeasanceâa corporate death penalty i mean of course in california we have the âthree strikes and youâre outâ law which applies to those who get caught smoking dope or the like yet corporations with fifteen strikes against them are not out obviously thatâs not fair i was involved for many years in efforts to head a socially responsible business and to generally try to makeÂ allÂ businesses become more socially responsible i think those are worthy efforts but i actually came to the conclusion that they are doomed to fail or that they are not enough yes you can try to put the really bad corporations to death but the commons will still be ravaged in other words you need to do something that is external to the corporation iâm more or less willing to let corporations be corporations yes it would be nice to make them a little gentler but what will make them gentler is to limit the harm they can do by having external limits it has to do with internalizing externalities if they have to pay for pollution theyâre going to want to pay as little as possible the technology will shift from burning fossil fuels to clean renewable kinds of energy technologies just because corporations will respond to those incentives and those limits i often get into arguments with people who think we can reform corporations and i certainly wouldnât want to discourage anybody from trying but i think the real solution is to build up the common sector Â  your reference to the grand party weâve had makes me think you might have read richard heinbergâs recent bookÂ the partyâs over if you havenât i recommend it to you my concern is your reliance on the trust and the provision of a citizensâ dividend what i would prefer to do is sort out what ought to be public and what ought to be private i would like to see the elimination altogether of the income tax which causes so much dishonesty and inefficiency and other problems and its replacement with scarcity rent which we now know is easily upward of  per cent of gross domestic product and perhaps as high as  per cent by collecting all that economic rent we could provide the services for government that we reasonably ought to have and probably offer some kind of citizensâ dividend in addition to me thatâs a far more efficient way to use the pricing mechanism to allocate resourcesÂ  i recognize the ideas of henry george in what you say and iâm very sympathetic to that at the same time iâm thinking incrementally and i wouldnât want to abolish the income tax iâd like to make it more progressive for the foreseeable future and i certainly would not want to abolish the inheritance tax which i think is critical in general though i like your idea Â  iâm interested particularly in the creative commons illustrated by the open sharing of ideas that you mentioned and in the way the scientific discoveries and artistic expression of today stand on the shoulders of scientific and artistic endeavors of the past iâm concerned about the infringement on the intellectual commons of intellectual property such as copyrights patents and the jealous guarding of authorship how can we protect this aspect of the commons and collaborate more energetically as creative beingsÂ  in my report thereâs a discussion of that aspect of the commons there wasnât time to go into it in my talk the constitution authorizes congress to create patents and copyrights for limited terms the notion of the founders was that authors would be given copyrights for fourteen years or some relatively short period of time and then everything would enter the public domain you do want to have some way of rewarding artists and creators but their work shouldnât remain private indefinitely whatâs happened especially in the past twenty or thirty years is that the copyrights have been extended again and again and they are now essentially perpetual one of the key forces behind this was the disney corporation because it wanted to keep mickey mouse private forever of course disney freely steals stories such as snow white and pinocchio from the commons then privatizes them and copyrights them forever the same thing is happening with the internet and with patents itâs an ominous trend and i completely agree with you that we need to revive and strengthen the cultural and scientific commons i believe thereâs a man in the audience lewis hyde who is writing a book on this very topic Â  thank you for your vision my question is about reverence the vision you presented is based on a shift in reverence from capital to the commons when i look at shopping malls and at the students i go to school with and at the larger world i see such a deep reverence for and commitment to the market that i donât see the shift happening how do we encourage that shift in reverence without it can any of your vision come about reverence is a matter of education and culture the shift is a slow process but i do think it is underway yes itâs an uphill battle against huge forces advertising budgets shopping malls all of that we need repetition of our message we need to have more people like thomas berry and we need to promote his message Â  i just wanted to point out that music has been returned to the commons in the past couple of years thanks to napster and much that has followed people can now pretty much get any music they want without copyright or any legal restrictions iâm wondering if a lot of other intellectual property may go that route if technologies will simply liberate intellectual property from the commodity realm without us doing anything we do have to figure out a way to compensate artists so itâs a tricky problem but technology is certainly helping concluding remarks i really donât know how to add to what andrew kimbrell and father thomas berry have so eloquently said what iâm thinking is how overwhelming it feels when we consider all the radical changes that need to be made and how seemingly little time there is to make them itâs depressing it can be paralyzing and my way of dealing with that is to say yes we are up against this incredible juggernaut yes we have to change consciousness we have to change law we have to change economics we have to change education and on and on there is so much to be done we may or may not be able to make a difference but we have to act as if weÂ areÂ going to make a difference we have to believe that we will and it might just come about change happens in surprising ways because it is nonlinear and one day there may be a point at which it comes all at once there is no way we can foresee when or how so it is crucial for us to act as if it is going to happen Â  Â  peter barnesÂ was cofounder and president of the socially responsible telephone company working assets in  he was named social entrepreneur of the year for northern california for his innovative leadership but even before his successful role as a social entrepreneurÂ  barnes was interested in the commons and its appropriate form of ownership a former journalist he covered ownership
