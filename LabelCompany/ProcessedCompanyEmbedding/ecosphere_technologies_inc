ecosphere technologies inc water management solutions for municipalities the capability of municipalities to meet the demands of growing populations is currently being stretched very thin water scarcity and strict regulatory compliance are just a few of the challenges being faced ecosphere technologies portfolio of patented technologies provides the means by which municipalities can at once improve the effectiveness and lower the cost of water management programs while reducing dependency on hazardous chemicals such as chlorine  water and wastewater treatment services for municipalities water disinfection and sterilization one of municipalities’ core responsibilities is ensuring the reliable availability of a clean water source to the public through a proven advanced oxidation process ecosphere’s patented chemicalfree ozonix® water treatment technology can help municipalities meet this demand through costeffective and environmentally responsible disinfection oxidation and sterilization of water oxidation of contaminants ozonix® can help municipalities decrease liability and improve capacity through the chemical free treatment of all bacteria and soluble organics in the

companies solve some of the most significant process wastewater treatment challenges in the world – cost effectively and chemically free  bacteria biofilm treatment and control ozonix® provides highly effective chemicalfree microbial control through the complete oxidization of bacteria and destruction of bacteria cell walls and biofilms it accomplishes this through the production of hydroxyl radicals oh that are significantly more powerful than chlorine or ozone when used in isolation prevention of biofouling scaling and corrosion ozonix® helps protect assets and improve productivity by effectively combatting scaling corrosion and biofouling while eliminating costly biocides and reducing scale inhibitors needed for corrosion control sludge treatment and recovery the processing of wastewater residuals sewage sludge into biosolids for reuse is a proven means of improving operational sustainability for all manner of organizations effective implementation of this recycling process relies almost solely on the underlying technologies that support it ecosphere’s portfolio of patented technologies is helping businesses and organizations around the world thrive through the

lease obligations liquidity as of may   ecosphere had cash on hand of approximately  due to the nature of its technology licensing business model ecosphere presently does not have any regularly recurring revenue management believes that these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report to support its operations the company has a number of plans to monetize its intellectual property which is described below in order to stay operational the companys principal lender has continued to advance funds to the company on an as needed basis during  he has lent the company  million represented by a secured promissory note and convertible notes that are convertible at  per share and due in december  these notes are secured by a variety of security interests on intellectual property and other assets of the company in addition the companys principal lender lent the company and sogs  during  until the company can generate sufficient working capital to begin to repay this indebtedness and other indebtedness this lender has rights which are superior to the companys shareholders as well as other creditors the company is working on a number of initiatives which if consummated can provide liquidity � as a result of the recently announced sogs product and services line the company and sogs have begun discussions with multiple commercial licensed growers that the company expects could generate significant contracts and liquidity for the company moving forward � the company is currently evaluating multiple opportunities to take sogs public in order to provide liquidity for its shareholders assuming that sogs is able to raise capital and become publicly reporting it will pay ecosphere  million of proceeds in addition ecosphere will receive ongoing monthly management fees from sogs � during the summer of  the company expects to complete phase  of its cannatech agriculture center in washington state if the company can raise approximately  million the company expects for the business model of edc to generate significant monthly recurring longterm revenue for the shareholders of ecosphere and is a potential source of liquidity the company and edc expect to replicate this business model not only in washington state but in locations throughout the united states that are geographically politically and economically well positioned � the company and edc are seeking to raise the remaining  million balance of an offering of a percentage of edc phase  revenues generated in connection with the washington cannatech agriculture center project � the company continues to have ongoing discussions with potential strategic partners and licensees of its multipatented and proven ozonixr and ecos powercuber technologies the company also continues to engage in numerous pilots and demonstrations to demonstrate the effectiveness of its ozonixr technology when conventional water treatment methods cant effectively compete management is uncertain whether it will have liquidity for the next  months ecosphere plans to continue monetizing its intellectual property and has identified the following liquidity sources that it expects to realize over the next three years � ecosphere is actively marketing exclusive and nonexclusive licensing opportunities for sale to strategic well positioned partners that wish to bring our patented ozonixr and ecos powercuber technologies to specific industries in their respective countries and regions of the world ecosphere is providing a pilot to a customer that if successful has the ability to provide significant cash to ecosphere management expects this will result in similar realization of the value that has been realized by the development and sale of the global energy rights for its ozonixr technology to fnes ecosphere owns  of the global rights to its patented ozonixr technology for all nonenergy related applications including but not limited to food and beverage industrial marine and municipal wastewater treatment and any other industry in which water is treated with conventional liquid chemicals ecosphere also owns  of the global right to its patented ecos powercuber technology for all industries and applications worldwide ecosphere technologies inc and subsidiaries � ecospheres business model revolves upon the licensing of its intellectual property to strategic customers and partners around the world that are well positioned and capitalized to bring ecospheres patented technologies to their respective industries and countries additionally ecosphere has its own inhouse design engineering and manufacturing facilities to support customers and licensees that choose to not manufacture ecospheres patented technologies themselves in addition to the various licensing opportunities that are available for its patented ozonixr and ecos powercuber technologies globally the companys  interest in fnes is also available for sale to strategic buyers management believes that the realization of any of the above events will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future historically in the  years since inception ecosphere often has had liquidity problems but it has always found financing and new business to support its operations management believes that it will do so again although no assurances can be given the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern in addition to needing capital to support its
