sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum as a real estate expert and harvard business school management professor arthur segel is in demand around the world as a guest lecturer when he packed his bags last month to teach a landvaluation class inindia he brought along a favorite case that has become a staple of the real estate survey course he has taught at harvard for many years to develop the case he enlisted a harvard business school graduate he met  years ago while still an executive for boston properties inc segel describes his coauthor as thoughtful intellectually curious an excellent listener and genuinely humble—an uncommon and appealing combination among harvard’s highpowered mba candidates   although the case study is familiar to legions of harvard business school alumni segel’s collaborator has other claims to fame as president  ceo of cbl  associates properties inc stephen lebovitz leads a retail reit that owns an  millionsquarefoot state portfolio of  properties including  regional malls and openair centers since succeeding the firm’s founder—his father charles lebovitz who remains active as executive chairman—as ceo three years ago lebovitz has shepherded the chattanooga tennbased firm through the aftermath of a difficult recession   on his watch the company has maintained solid leasing started to reduce leverage and selectively pursued new developments he has also built on the firm’s longtime strategy of staking out dominant positions in markets that are usually outside the nation’s biggest metropolitan areas in many cases its  regional malls and openair centers are the only game in town   lebovitz’s associates say that he combines the best qualities of an earlier era with an uptotheminute corporate and capital markets knowhow like his father they say lebovitz is a toughminded but trustworthy dealmaker who considers a handshake agreement to be as binding as a written contract “in an industry filled with a lot of personalities i don’t think there’s anybody that doesn’t like charles and stephen” said michael graziano managing director  cohead of real estate investment banking at goldman sachs group inc which has arranged financing for cbl and advises the firm on a continuing basis graziano calls stephen lebovitz “a trustworthy ethical guy … an individual that everybody likes to work with” and the younger lebovitz brings a wall street background and elite business school training to the complex new realities of public real estate companies   those bona fi des have enabled lebovitz to navigate a slow uneven economic recovery last october cbl sealed one of the year’s blockbuster joint ventures a  billion alliance with tiaacref by transferring propertyrelated debt to the institutional giant and applying cash proceeds from the transaction to reduce leverage by another  million cbl trimmed its outstanding debt by  million that accomplishment was also a milestone in an effort that has reduced the company’s debt by  billion since    the deal recapitalized four of cbl’s trophy mall properties westcountycenter a  millionsquarefoot superregional mall in des peresmo ast louissuburb oak park mall a  millionsquarefoot center inoverland parkkan and coolsprings galleria a  millionsquare foot superregional mall in franklin tenn a suburb ofnashville during last year’s second quarter cbl extended and modified three securedcredit facilities valued at  billion by basing interest on libor plus  to  basis points—the rate will vary with cbl’s corporate leverage ratio—the new terms will trim borrowing costs by  basis points on average last year samestore net operating income edged up  percent overall as portfolio occupancy reached  percent a yearoveryear uptick of  basis points funds from operations rose  cents per diluted share to    reflecting the retail sector’s stillmodest recovery lebovitz is also approving a select group of development projects as consumers continue their quest for value cbl like other retail developers is finding fertile ground in outlet centers in january cbl and horizon group properties inc announced a  joint venture to develop a squarefoot outlet center the outlet shoppes atatlanta located inwoodstock a northwesternatlantasuburb the project is scheduled for a summer  opening   that project follows last summer’s opening of the squarefoot outlet shoppes atoklahoma city a joint venture of cbl and horizon the project is thesoonerstate’s first such center and—characteristically—the only property of its type within a milewide radius in the communitycenter category the squarefoot waynesville commons inwaynesvillenc is scheduled to come online this fall   even as cbl forges ahead with the first wave of postrecession development it continues to focus on existing properties lebovitz and the company’s leadership team have earned a reputation for firstrate leasing property management tenant service and marketing last year the company ranked th on the cpemhn index of bestrun real estate companies and th among property managers “they watch the details— they sweat the details” said david zoba senior vice president  head of global real estate for gap inc which leases about  square feet in cbl properties nationwide “a lot of people that have properties in secondary markets don’t run them as well” keeping assets like cbl’s profitable demands especially sharp management zoba explained because “in secondary markets you’re not going to get the highest rents in the industry”   as part of its stewardship cbl selects a handful of regional malls every year for makeovers though many of the centers are already dominant in their markets the strategy recognizes a fundamental truth of retail real estate “in order to keep customers coming back the properties have to be fresh and up to date” lebovitz said this year’s list includes regional malls intexasmississippiandnorth carolina the  millionsquarefoot cross creek mall infayettevillenc will get new entrances interior décor and graphics amenities and landscaping besides attending to curb appeal cbl constantly reviews the tenant mix “we’re very proactive in terms of moving stores around” lebovitz asserted “we’re not waiting on the lease to expire to make those kinds of changes”   financial report   recent analyst reports regarding cbl offer a spectrum of impressions in a february update green street advisors analyst cedrik lachance calls cbl “a good operator” citing a basispoint jump in occupancy last year and rent appreciation on new leases for the past two years the company has been a net asset seller and has allocated proceeds to retiring debt and cbl’s  ratio of debt to ebitda “is a little lower than the mall sector average” lachance wrote   that saidgreen streetalso offers a few cautionary notes cbl’s leverage at  percent is  percent higher than the sector for the mall sector as a whole lachance argued in  and  almost  percent of cbl’s total pro rata debt obligations— billion—will come due lachance calls cbl’s expectation that it can meet those needs through noncore asset sales cmbs bank lending and existing credit lines “a fair assumption” nevertheless he warns against expecting that both a vibrant transaction market and adequate cmbs financing will always be available at the same time   a report by keybanc capital markets’ todd thomas offers a similarly nuanced view the company’s conservative guidance and “a steady capital markets and leasing environment could lead to upside throughout the year” thomas also argued that cbl’s  billion revolving credit line is enough to meet  million in debt obligations this year even if the real estate capital markets go through a downturn the mixed picture in the retail market presents leasing challenges although leasing velocity remains steady about  percent of new leases during the fourth quarter of  derived from shortterm deals a case in point—a location deal with struggling pacific sunwear—speaks to the continuing softness in some quarters   when lebovitz stepped into the ceo role in  he immediately had to contend with the fallout of the recession net operating income slipped  percent year over year in both  and —the first such declines since the company’s ipo in  “what we tried to do was anticipate what was coming and make the difficult decisions early” lebovitz recalled “waiting and putting off tough decisions is not something that helps anyone” like most reits cbl had to reduce expenses by trimming staff curtailing its development pipeline and postponing property renovations   the company also moved swiftly to shore up its balance sheet reaching out early to its lenders and restructuring lines of credit cbl pulled off a feat that was unusual among reits during the capital markets crisis by working with its financiers and in some cases changing the mix of lenders it extended its credit facilities without having to reduce their capacity that same year cbl also extended or refinanced nine mortgages and construction loans valued at  million all told the efforts gave it  billion in financial flexibility   while some reits felt compelled to shut down their pipelines completely in  and  “we divided projects into phases” he explained “that allowed us to move forward with what we had leased” in october  cbl and its partner forum development group llc opened the promenade a power center in d’ibervillemiss that was the biggest new retail project on the gulf coast of mississippi since hurricane katrina although the center was planned for  square feet at full buildout cbl opened only the squarefoot first phase which was  percent preleased to a roster of tenants led by anchors target best buy petsmart dick’s sporting goods marshall’s and ulta   other cbl openings during the recession include the forum atgrandview a community center inmadisonmiss developed jointly with the mattiacecothe project’s squarefoot first phase opened fully leased in november  and in march  cbl and the benchmark group unveiled phase i of the pavilion atport orange a squarefoot center in thecentral floridacity ofport orange with a roster of plus tenants the center opened  percent leased   fast learner lebovitz gravitated toward a real estate career at an early age dinnertable discussions exposed him to the business and his summer jobs were often in construction or real estate after earning a degree in political science and human biology from stanford in  lebovitz spent two years as a financial analyst in the real estate department of goldman sachs  co that experience he said laid a vital foundation “goldman gave me a huge amount of financial experience and understanding— how to underwrite a piece of real estate how to package it for sale” he explained   following graduation fromharvardbusinessschoolin  lebovitz joined cbl  associates inc the forerunner of today’s firm at the time cbl was eyeing growth opportunities with walmart and home depot two regular clients in the company’s southeast properties a further priority was building ties to new englandbased retailers like bj’s wholesale club tj maxx and marshalls already planted in thebostonarea lebovitz got the assignment of opening an office there to serve as the base camp for the company’s northeast expansion the first project was a squarefoot community center inportlandmebut financing proved to be a tall order in the depths of the savingsandloan crisis it was impossible to secure construction loans from potential lenders innew england lebovitz’s search led him back tochattanooga where a longtime cbl lender agreed to finance the project   the experience was an early lesson in the value of building relationships lebovitz spent  to  rising steadily through the ranks while still running the company’s northeast activities in  he put his capital markets expertise to work when cbl made its initial public offering he was promoted to senior vice president of communitycenter development in  moved up to executive vice president for development in  and began overseeing acquisitions as well the next year the appointment as company president came in    not long afterward cbl began work on a pivotal deal the  billion purchase of  regional malls and two other centers from the richard e jacobs group completed in  the acquisition put cbl on the course to its current footprint increasing the number of regional malls from  to  and its portfolio to  properties   cbl’s next blockbuster acquisition could well be some years away as the company sticks to debt reduction selective development and improving productivity at existing centers for now this approach is producing gains but lebovitz would be the first to tell you that there are no guarantees for even the most powerful bestrun firms still moses lebovitz would surely be pleased to know that a third generation of able executives is dedicated to keeping the family business in such good repair   arthur segel cbl  associates properties inc harvard university real estate market trends stephen lebovitz related posts nar promotes new ceo  june   small business

factory outleti just finished up reitweek  in new york city and i decided that i would write an article to summarize my collective feelings surrounding the conference and the reit market in general first off based on attendance numbers reitweek was a success there were over  in attendance and most all of the investor presentation rooms were filled with people a few rooms were standing room only notably taubman centers nysetco and tanger factory outlet centers nyseskt i have attended numerous reitweek conferences over the years and it seemed that the latest conference had the most investor participation i was also glad to see my coauthor and i sell over  signed books of the intelligent reit investor message me if you would like an autographed copy it was great to see many of my friends there and it was especially good to have my daughter lauren thomas participating as a rising retail rock star reporter at cnbc what a terrific time to be writing on the retail industry here’s a few headline quotes from the conference there will be a massive wave of retail bankruptcies  gordon dugan ceo of gramercy property trust nysegpt if you follow popular media amazon nasdaqamzn will be the

mark decesaris ceo of wp carey nysewpc negative media is relentless  stephen d lebovitz ceo of cbl properties nysecbl the battle is who can do brick  mortar better  sandeep mathrani ceo of ggp inc nyseggp many retailers peddle the same product  joseph f coradino ceo or preit nysepei after listening to over  presentations in two days i became almost disoriented who do you believe the media the industrial reits that own buildings leased to amazon or the retail reits in fact as i reflect on my two days at reitweek in which retail reits were the talk of the town and after soaking up the valuable intel from the various management teams i have reached one simple conclusion and you can find out by reading my article or simply scrolling down to the bottom of it focus on quality as you know quality has become the big focus for me in the retail reit sector in january i opted to move out of the lowerquality names to focus almost exclusively on the bluechip reits such as simon property group nysespg taubman centers tanger factory outlet centers kimco realty and brixmor nysebrx while the yields are enticing for many of the lowerquality reits my decision to focus on the higherquality names is based on the argument that the cream always rises to the top i don’t know about you but i like investing in growth stocks not just reits and when i see companies that are growing earnings and dividends it’s a true sign that there are good things ahead take a look at these mall reits below based on ffoshare data as you can see i have buy recommendations on spg skt tco pei mac and ggp i have hold or sell ratings on cbl wpg and srg now let’s review the shopping center reits based on ffoshare data as you see i have buy ratings on wsr uba roic reg ue and krg and i have strong buy ratings on kim and brx note my buy recommendation for wsr is valuebased as i do not consider the quality the same as the others whatsoever i have hold or sell recommendations for whlr wri rpt ddr and akr i believe that we are beginning to see a bifurcation in quality within the retail reit sector and that can easily be viewed by inspecting the pffo multiples andor dividend yields for these reits while the dividend yields may be attractive for reits such as wpg cbl whlr and ddr it’s important for investors to consider the reasons for focusing on quality even if the payout ratios are attractive is the retail sector experiencing secular or cyclical shifts perhaps it’s both but i attribute the pullback to the biggest gorilla in the room and it’s not amazon when will sears file bankruptcy as i said it’s great having a daughter who covers retail and does all of the heavy lifting recently lauren thomas wrote this article sears just surprised wall street with a narrowerthanexpected loss shares jump  and she explained sears nasdaqshld inked a deal to extend a portion of a  million secured loan facility and annuitize  million of its pension obligations the retailer said its now targeting a reduction in its outstanding debt and pension obligations of  billion this fiscal year… cash injections from lamperts hedge fund esl investments and his heavy ownership of sears unsecured debt helped convince some investors that the company would avoid filing chapter  this year there is little doubt that sears will eventually file bankruptcy and based upon the latest news the likelihood for bankruptcy will be after the holidays as lauren thomas suggests they sears are doubling down on defensive measures  such as reducing shipments and asking for better payment terms  to protect against the risk of nonpayment as sears warns about its finances it’s clear that the reit market is already pricing in a sears bankruptcy that will leave many mall reits scrambling for cover the mall reits with the most sears exposure include pei cbl wpg and of course srg earlier this week i listened to the cbl presentation at reitweek and i heard lebovitz say that our balance sheet is stronger than ever he was referring to the company’s  million line of credit and  million of free cash flow i asked him about the cotenancy requirements that are included in many of the mall leases and he said that most of the agreements require two anchors to vacate so even if sears did file the inline tenants would not be impacted however should sears file cbl and similar landlords would be forced to pay additional expenses such as taxes insurance and maintenance that would eat into cash flow nonetheless i consider cbl’s dividend safe and that’s one of the reasons that i decided to upgrade from a sell to a hold why not a buy lebovitz also made an interesting point and one that made me ponder the entire retail reit sector he said that most retail bankruptcies occur in the first quarter of the year and that he was not expecting to see many more in  then i thought to myself why would i want to own shares in cbl now even though the dividend is safe when the next shoe to drop is likely in q of course when i say shoe i am referring to sears it’s clear that the mall reits have priced in the potential for bankruptcy but the overhang is likely to linger until the poop hits the fan trouble is still brewing and whether it’s a secular or a cyclical shift i don’t think it’s prudent to place any bets on cbl wpg or srg until there is more clarity my take there is clearly a secular shift when it comes to technology and amazon has truly disrupted the land of brick and mortar at some point q amazon will be declared a winner over sears but that does not mean that all retailers will go away in fact i would argue that most retailers have adapted to the changes and are successfully thriving in both retail outlet and online channels my best advice always invest in quality since the cream rises
