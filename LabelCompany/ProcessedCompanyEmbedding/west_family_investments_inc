new york city new york united states the group of buildings known as astor row is comprised of  houses effectively grouped in pairs extending along most of the south side of th street between fifth avenue and lenox avenue they were bull t as a speculative development in the s at a time when william astor owned this land their architectural details are unusual for their place and time and their coherent style sets them apart from other remaining thcentury rowhouses in the harlem area as a group they create a pleasant streetfront recalling a period when harlem was changing from a country town to an urbanized area practically all the houses that stand in harlem today were built in the period beginning in the s through the first decade of the th century exclusive homes such as those on striver’s row in the st nicholas historic district helped establish harlem as a center of fashion and elegance the area also boasted rows of more modest brownstones the popular polo grounds and the distinguished harlem opera house some speculators made tremendous profits by buying and reselling land prices increased so dramatically that one oldtimer complained in  ”when i see the prices real estate is now bringing in harlem it makes me feel that i was a fool for not making investments years ago when property was so cheap one canny investor was john jacob astor adhering to his own principles of buying land in outlying areas of new york on the certain conviction that the city would eventually grow to meet them he hea purchased a number of lots in harlem at an auction in  astor’s creed was to pay less than premium price because the land was uninhabited or farmland lie was content to hold onto his lots for long periods allowing them to remain empty until someone came along who was interested in improving them the block of west th street between fifth and lenox avenues was purchased by astor in  for  when astor died in  the block passed with the rest of his estate to his son william backhouse astor william b astor’s holdings were in turn bequeathed in  to his sons john jacob astor iii and william astor these two created a partition agreement in  dividing the inherlted real estate between themselves on this block in harlem john jacob astor iii received the southern half of the block which faces th street jots  while william astor held title to the northern half facing th street lots  astor row was constructed on part of this latter section in the early s during the tremendous harlem building boom in  as part of william astor’s will the houses were divided among his grandchildren mary james and sarah van alen they maintained ownership until the second and third decade of the th century during their ownership these were single family dwellings housing middleand uppermiddleclass whites people of taste and wealth from downtown manhattan in  the houses were described by a new york times reporter as one of the most attractive and exclusive home centres in harlem presenting a picture of domestic tranquility and comfort which few other blocks in the city possess sarah van alen was the first of the astor row land holders to sell divesting herself of nos  lots  in  the rest of astor row was held by mary and james van alen until  and  respectively an allwhite enclave until that time astor row was described in claude clay’s novel home to harlem new york  as the block beautiful by the time these lots were sold harlem was predominately populated by africanamericans during the next ten years harlem changed from a promising black community to a deplorable slum a tremendous need for housing due to the influx of blacks from the south and from the west indies as well as exorbitant rents for the living spaces that existed led to the subdivision of houses like those on astor row although built for single families within a short time they were carved up into boarding houses and singleroom  occupancy dwellings their ownership changed often during these years as did the tenants and the modifications to the interiors these buildings on astor row provide an excellent study in the development and change of the community of harlem today most of these buildings remain divided into single room or small apartments the only exception is no  which is owned by and serves the pentecostal faith church the  buildings of astor row were constructed in three groups nos  were built first in  the architect was charles buek the second group of houses nos  was built in  while the final section nos  was erected later in  the design of the last twenty houses created without benefit of an architect was almost identi  west th street houses chelsea manhattan no  west th street was erected by philo v beebe a neighborhood builder as part of a long row of handsome midth century threestory houses set behind landscaped front yards  feet deep the row now affords a welcome contrast to the towering sixteenstory london terrace apartments across the street in contrast the houses retain an appealing sense of human scale these dignified residences were part of the expanding chelsea community this included at the time of construction an imposing row of earlier greek revival residences—the original london terrace—on the north side of rd street between ninth and tenth avenues and back to back with it the modest gothic revival row houses known as chelsea cottages on the south side of th street these narrow little houses built primarily to house the people employed by the welltodo merchants on rd street were erected three years before nos  west lith street the latter were built in response to a need for more housing in the area for business and professional people the row was erected by beebe the builder in association with beverly robinson counselloratlaw who had owned the land since  and george f talman who acquired it on april  iit robinson however retained an interest in the property while the houses were under construction beverly robinson  was closely associated both as a friend and as an attorney with successive generations of the clarke and hoore families heirs of the estate once known as chelsea farm from  through the early s robinson gradually expanded his holdings in the area both he and clement clark moore served for four decades as trustees of columbia college in  at the time of their erection the residences at nos  west th street were among the large and imposing houses in the area originally the row consisted of twelve individual brick houses later reduced to eleven as the result of the combination of nos  and  they were built as six pairs with doorways and stoops adjoining in neighborly fashion resulting in the sharing of the center handrailing transitional in style the houses display an interesting combination of features from both the earlier greek revival and newer italianate modes the basic proportions however are greek revival later th century modifications to some of the houses introduced neogrec and queen anne features followed by the popular neofederal style of the th century thus they represent more than a century of architectural development in general the houses retain their setback behind front yards their original height bold modillioned roof cornices and ironwork—features which contribute to the unity of the row as a very special feature of the neighborhood and of manhattan no  west th street erected in  is set behind a low brick wall the yard has a curved pebbled area affording play space for young children the house is constructed of brick and retains its high stoop which was originally paired with no  its long parlorfloor windows fine ironwork and rusticated basement the handrailings at the wide stoop are cast in a variant of the italianate style of the s at the left side the spiral handrailing rests upon decorative volutes at each riser a newel post surmounted by a little urn terminates the handrailing at the right side of the stoop the house has been extensively altered in the neofederal manner the doorway is enframed by three high sidelights and a small fanlight set into the transom area the window sash is nineovernine at the parlor floor and sixoversix at the upper two stories exterior blinds flank the windows and metal cornices have been added above the older lintels and cornices the building has been raised and has a modillioned roof cornice influenced by the french neogrec style with three louvered vents cut into the fascia one of the interesting features of this property appears between nos  and  where the yard railing which has an attractive fleurdelis design has been adjusted to accommodate the thick trunk of the large ailanthus tree in the yard of no  tthe first owner of this dignified house was julia ann gray wife of george gray who purchased the house as an investment from the builder in march  the grays lived at  washington square – from the  nyclpc landmark designation report share
