to the pbf energy fourth quarter and full year  earnings conference call and webcast at this time all participants have been placed in a listenonly mode the floor will be opened for your questions following managements prepared remarks its now my pleasure to turn the floor over to mr colin murray investor relations please go ahead colin murray  headinvestor relations thank you keith good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call with me today are tom omalley our executive chairman tom nimbley our ceo erik young our cfo and several other members of our management team a copy of todays earnings release including supplemental financial and operating information is available on our website before getting started id like to direct your attention to the forwardlooking statement disclaimer contained in todays press release in summary it outlines that statements contained in the press release and on this call that express the companys or managements expectations or predictions of the future are forwardlooking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we described in our filings with the sec as also noted in our press release well be using several nongaap measures while describing pbfs operating performance and financial results as we believe these metrics are useful but they are nongaap measures and should be taken as such it is important to note that well emphasize adjusted fully converted earnings information and results excluding special items our gaap net income or gaap eps figures reflect the percentage interest in pbf energy company llc owned by pbf energy inc we think adjusted fully converted net income and eps are meaningful metrics to you because they present  of the operations on an aftertax basis during the fourth quarter of  average hydrocarbon prices decreased and for pbf this generated a noncash lower of cost or market or lcm aftertax charge of approximately  million in our comments today well exclude this and other special items from our discussion of our quarterly results i will now turn the call over to tom nimbley thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on todays call excluding special items pbf generated approximately  billion of ebitda in  we strengthened our balance sheet and raised approximately  million in capital markets to fund our strategic initiatives including the acquisition of chalmette and the pending acquisition of torrance following these two acquisitions we will have established pbf energy as the fourth largest independent refiner in the us going into  we are focused on successfully integrating our new and future assets improving operational reliability and investing in margin improvement projects across all of our facilities all while maintaining capital discipline and a strong balance sheet we took over chalmette on november  the transition and integration was seamless and the employees at chalmette are a welcomed and valuable addition to the pbf family since joining our refining system chalmette has performed well and contributed approximately  million or over  of our total adjusted refining ebitda for the fourth quarter as expected we have identified several opportunities to enhance the earnings power of chalmette through commercial optimization and quick hit highreturn projects we have earmarked  million of capital in  to continue to identify and implement projects at chalmette and to assess the potential for restarting some of the idled units we are still in the early stages of evaluating the condition of the idled units the potential cost and timeline to restart them and ultimately the impact to our margin and yield as with chalmette our other refineries performed well during the fourth quarter and the east coast continues to deliver strong results overall refiners and consumers have benefited from the current low crude price environment while we expect that flat prices will eventually rise they may remain at current levels for some period of time we continue to use our crude sourcing flexibility which has improved with the addition of chalmette to take advantage of opportunities to provide our refineries with the most economic crude slates going into  we believe the outlook for clean products candidly is mixed yearoveryear clean product demand is up approximately  and average vehicle miles traveled is up over  versus  barring a major economic shock we expect that demand will remain strong for gasoline this year distillate is a bit more of a concern and the current inventory overhang may take longer to resolve itself given the mild winter as you are most likely aware during the blizzard that occurred in the northeast in january we incurred a total loss of power at delaware city which resulted in the shutdown of the refinery the refinery was restreamed with the exception of the fluid coker after  days as the coker was essentially at endofrun conditions we decided to advance the day turnaround that was scheduled to begin in the second half of march we expect the net impact of the additional downtime associated with the blizzard to be a loss of approximately  million we expect the turnaround to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter lastly i would like to provide a brief update on the torrance acquisition our expectation for closing the transaction remains consistent with our initial announcement which is to close during the second quarter as we have mentioned previously the acquisition will only close once exxonmobil has proven the refinery to be fully operational with that i will turn the call over to erik young c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks tom today we reported fourth quarter operating income of approximately  million and adjusted fully converted net income for the fourth quarter of  million or  per share on a fully exchanged fully diluted basis this compares to operating income of approximately  million and adjusted fully converted net income of approximately  million or  per share for the fourth quarter of  adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million as compared to adjusted ebitda of  million for the year ago quarter for the year we reported operating income of approximately  million and adjusted fully converted net income of approximately  million or  per share again on a fully exchanged fully diluted basis this compares to operating income of approximately  million and adjusted fully converted net income of approximately  million or  per share for the full year  adjusted ebitda for  was approximately  million as compared to adjusted ebitda of  billion for the year ago period as colin mentioned a moment ago these figures exclude the noncash lcm expense plus a small benefit associated with the accounting treatment for the tax receivable agreement as applicable for the fourth quarter ga expenses were approximately  million as compared to  million a year ago the increase is largely attributable to higher employee expenses and additional acquisition related costs including staff augmentation depreciation and amortization expense was approximately  million versus  million in  the increase in depreciation is primarily related to the amortization of the toledo turnaround which took place in the fourth quarter of  fourth quarter interest expense was approximately  million compared to  million last year pbfs reported effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately  which includes the impact of the change in the tra liability our yeartodate effective tax rate is approximately  and for modeling purposes you should continue to assume a normalized rate of  pbf ended the year with liquidity of approximately  billion and consolidated net debt to cap of  expenditures incurred during the year related to refining and corporate capex were approximately  million excluding railcar purchases and sales but including expenditures for chalmette our board has approved a quarterly dividend of  per share payable on march  to shareholders of record as of february   in early january we provided preliminary guidance for  as a result of the unplanned downtime at delaware following the blizzard combined with the acceleration of the coker turnaround throughput guidance on the east coast was reduced for the first quarter to  barrels per day to  barrels per day we believe accelerating the turnaround positions the east coast well for the second quarter as delaware should be up and running at a point when margins should be better than they are today the reduced east coast throughput in the first quarter has an impact on the full year throughput expectations which are now  barrels per day to  barrels per day calculated using our new east coast figure for the first quarter and  barrels per day for the remainder of the year we also expect to see an increase in operating expenses per barrel for the east coast as a result of the downtime all of our other guidance remains unchanged also of note today pbf logistics announced the distribution increase to  per unit a  increase from the last quarter as a reminder pbf energy owns  of the units of pbf logistics and  of the gp and incentive distribution rights and we continue to benefit from participation in the second level of the idr splits last week pbf logistics announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire four east coast terminals from plains all american we view this as a timely and strategic transaction for pbf logistics as it adds thirdparty revenue to the partnership and demonstrates our disciplined approach to sourcing and executing transactions at attractive acquisition multiples in a challenging market in addition to adding unaffiliated thirdparty customers and doubling the storage capacity of the partnership most importantly the terminals are expected to provide pbf energy with the opportunity to optimize product distribution and realize synergies with our east coast system as a result of our successful capital markets transactions during the fourth quarter of  where we raised  million of debt and equity we believe that we are well positioned to finance the torrance acquisition given the current market environment we believe it is important to be diligent in managing the balance sheet to put ourselves in a position of maximum flexibility for  and beyond im now going to turn the call over to tom omalley for his closing comments thomas d omalley  executive chairman thank you very much certainly were pleased with the fourth quarter operation i really only have two comments the first that our operation of chalmette and the due diligence that we continue to carry out on torrance indicates to me that our initial expectation on both refineries was low both refineries have substantial upside from our initial calculations second thing and i think we should comment on it as we follow it on a daytoday basis crude markets obviously we continue to see them under pressure we dont believe that its going to go too much lower than the current level of   for wti and perhaps  or  above for brent but we do believe its going to take six months to  months to get a sustained improvement in this pricing for any heavy refiner low oil prices are a benefit we make products such as petroleum coke and sulfur that really arent related too much to the actual price of the feedstock that we use this has been quite a benefit for us and were pleased that it will continue for some period of time on that note wed be pleased to take any questions you have questionandanswer session operator we can take our first question from evan calio with morgan stanley please go ahead evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc yeah good morning guys tom maybe to pick up on your last comment i mean on the heavy side you mentioned but can you comment on how youre seeing broader crude slate options across your system i mean light differentials are reemerging with storage capacity issues and looming midcon turnaround on the heavy side peda  base has had some recent operating issues just any color on how youre seeing options changing realtime to preserve margins in these current markets thomas d omalley  executive chairman well the lightheavy differential in our view is going to continue to expand you do have storage issues there but i dont think they are going to be an overwhelming factor when you look at these differentials i think the important thing always to focus on is not the absolute level of the differential but rather what the differential is relative to the price of crude on a percentage basis so thats kind of the way we always look at it if we see a good percentage differential and certainly today the differentials are very good from our perspective if you looked at for instance mars versus wti today youre a little bit over  or in essence about  if you looked at it against brent the differential is well over  if you looked at wts well thats trading pretty much even with wti but of course well under brent in this marketplace if you got out to the west coast and you looked at your kern river crude youd see that its trading at over  under wti so we think its a good environment on heavy crude and of course part of that is the emergence of additional production from iran there really is no light production coming out of iran the average slate is going to look like our medium so from our point of view as a heavy crude oil refiner we like where we are evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc right tom maybe if i – just staying with the macro recession macro risks are looming larger having operated through several economic downturns can you discuss your portfolio or thoughts and maybe even capex flexibility if markets remain a little weaker thomas d omalley  executive chairman well i think obviously if youre an investor in the new york stock market and youre looking at it this morning youre not feeling particularly well the last time i looked the dow futures were down  points obviously were undergoing some adjustment here exactly why i suppose a combination of factors uncertainty on the political situation certainly still a mess in the middle east relatively slow growth we dont see a recession coming when we look at consumption patterns in our industry we see relatively slow growth but i think the market got ahead of itself and theres no sector if you think about this it seems to be pushing to the upside certainly the energy sector almost universally with some exception in the refining business has had a very tough time the ep business is a disaster the midstream is a disaster you go to the financial sector certainly everybody has been under pressure pharmaceuticals obviously are afraid of bernie sanders eventually being elected it will be a rush if he is elected to the exit doors of the united states so were buttoning the operation up certainly tom nimbley or erik or matt lucey or  thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director i could add something there tom to evans question specific to capex for the company as tom is saying were watching what youre watching and our main priority is to keep the balance sheet strong and we are taking defensive steps that in case in fact were wrong in our opinion or the like here toms opinion that we probably will not have a recession but we could be wrong we have about – in the guidance we gave you of  million to  million systemwide in capex  million of that is turnaround  million of it is capacity maintenance tier  health safety and environmental and theres about  million –  million of discretionary the discretionary is all on the table we could cut that back and in addition is some of the tier  investment that we have an option on in other words we can continue to use and buy credits that are available in the marketplace which would allow us to push back the physical investment to come into compliance from january  of  to beyond so look at in terms of somewhere around  million to  million probably of stuff that we could just say were not going to do because were concerned about whats going on in the economy evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc great i appreciate it guys operator and we can take our next question from roger read with wells fargo roger d read  wells fargo securities llc good morning thomas d omalley  executive chairman good morning roger d read  wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe a followup just real quickly on torrance q closing the last time we talked the expectation was that it would at least begin its restart in february i was just curious do you have any update on that i mean does february still look likely or should we think about that as having slipped a little bit thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director well i actually have jeff dill in the office here who is going to be – is the president of west coast operation he had discussions with exxonmobil yesterday they have indicated that they are on – actually a little bit ahead of the latest schedule that they have reviewed with us when we were at california several weeks ago they now anticipate effectively starting the startup activities on march  they have a day startup period which includes the  days that are required to prove out the units so effectively theres a period of time where they are going to prove the esp then they will start up the fcc and the attended units that have been down and then they will demonstrate performance over a day period if you do that math right now we are hopeful that we will effect the closing on may  roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay great thats helpful and then i dont know exactly who to direct the question to but we saw in the doe numbers yesterday a major decline in padd  utilization i recognize youre not a padd  refiner but the pricing pressure emanating out of padd  do you see or have you had – are you seeing a condition in the padd  area and maybe bleeding into the gulf coast that could force run cuts for any of your units thomas d omalley  executive chairman tom thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah i can handle that the short answer is yes we have negative gas cracks in padd  padd  is under pressure as you suggest we have taken steps in toledo we havent necessarily – weve cut crude and were running about  barrels a day crude its a tough place to get rid of the crude so cutting runs further you sometimes hurt yourself because you lose more on the crude youre selling than you are cutting back but we have in fact cut back the fcc weve cut back the hydrocracker we are storing some intermediates and not turning them into finished products obviously valero came out and said they were cutting back in memphis i suspect that what weve seen is the euphoria of pretty good gas cracks going all the way to the end of the year the refiners do what the refiners do they ran hard and they went to max gasoline mode and now we have seen the inventory build and what will likely happen or at least it is my expectation is that situation will reverse and youll – it is no longer an incentive to be at max gasoline and you can cut that back and go back to a balanced slate or effect run cuts to bring us back in balance and i still am somewhat bullish on gasoline as i said in my opening remarks roger d read  wells fargo securities llc yeah no i wouldnt disagree with you on that i was just curious whether youd cut any runs because we saw lets call it relative strength in syncrude relative to wti so just thinking about how that affects ohio but i appreciate your answers thanks operator well take the next question from blake fernandez with howard weil blake fernandez  scotia howard weil hey guys good morning tom during your prepared remarks you mentioned considering some of the restart of the idled units over at chalmette i was wondering – i am assuming youre still kind of in the process of getting numbers together but could you talk a little bit about what potential costs that might have what kind of ebitda contribution and maybe the timeline that youre looking at thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director sure rob sic blake  let me just make a general comment regarding investment or opportunities that we see in chalmette and were really focused on three areas as we continue to get more and more information around the site one is just logistics to bottleneck the refinery is logistically challenged they had too much emerged at the dock they had some constraints on being able to export gasoline because they have limitations on the recovery system things of that nature so we see opportunities to spend – and this is relatively small money – to put in a new crude tank as we did in toledo so were focusing on that as one kind of pathway to improve the margin of new product markets and commercial opportunities weve already entered the asphalt market which was not a business that they were in it is better alternative than coker feed in fact and certainly if you have to get into the fuel oil business we are going to start up likely a small – one of the idled units that they shut down was a petrochemical unit that would make paraxylene orthoxylene we believe thats a good opportunity for us and then the third lane evan sic blake  is frankly the bigger units that have been idled a hydrocracker a reformer pretreater and a coker as we look at those we suspect that were not going to start up the coker its relatively small and it really hasnt been kept in as good a condition as the other units right now we believe that there is likelihood that we will start up – it may take till  – all of the other units including a small cost accretive which allow us to get back into the jet business as i said we budgeted  million to spend this year and to help us define further we think were going to – were definitely honing in on this thing were looking at several alternatives around the hydrocracker well have that probably buttoned up here in the next three months to six months which way were going to go i think the estimates of how much money were going to spend will probably be somewhere between  million and  million if we do all of the restarts that i just mentioned and i would guess that wed probably have somewhere around  million to  million a year run rate ebitda blake fernandez  scotia howard weil great and just to be clear the  million you mentioned this year is that part of the  million discretionary spending that you referenced earlier thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yes it is blake fernandez  scotia howard weil okay the next piece is on heavy and gasoline i mean just looking in the fourth quarter looks like you had  of your crude and feedstock as heavy runs and then  yield on gasoline im just curious weve got a lot of moving pieces here with chalmette coming into the mix and then potentially torrance do you have any sense of kind of where thats going to get to once the system is fully integrated and up and running like whats the max level of heavy that you could run and what do you think your max gasoline yield could be thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director obviously best to look at it by refinery toledo obviously runs zero heavy so thats  light if you look at paulsboro medium sour to heavy thats basically the predominance in this slate so if youre  barrels a day of crude runs were running  barrels a day of saudi crude either medium and in some cases we run light and then were running vasconia and other heavy crudes on the others still delaware city well be typically running about an  mix of heavy to light  heavy waterborne is the most economic right now ex the fact that weve taken the coker turnaround obviously that doesnt apply while the coker is down chalmette is about the same were looking for options to run bakken they are not as economic as frankly the venezuelan crude some of the south american crude that were running so youre going to – and then when torrance comes in of course it runs a  degree  degree api slate so on balance were probably in the   medium to heavy range for the total crude slate assuming the economics are there now one of the things that we like about our system is if they shift we have the optionality particularly on the east coast and in chalmette to swing that around gasoline yield   i go back to the fourth quarter everybody including pbf turned the dials to make more gasoline maximized conversion on the hydrocrackers maximize conversion on cat naphthas and things of that nature so it could go up a little higher it did go up a little higher however i suspect that it will reequilibrate somewhere around a slight bias of   systemwide gasoline  distillate and the rest others stuff blake fernandez  scotia howard weil thats helpful thanks tom operator well take the next question from paul sankey with wolfe research paul sankey  wolfe research llc good morning everyone tom i read about the delaware city turnaround i think that there was some additional commentary that you would be sourcing oil from the bakken but i dont see it in your press release could you just update us on where you are with that and if you can really train in additional barrels i was just sort of thinking about the economics of this price deck thanks thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah good question paul we obviously – first of all were going to be running – were running about  barrels a day of crude right now well well be taking that up to about  barrels a day we are running a mix but we are moving a little bit more towards bakken we can make money on a variable cost basis on bakken and we will be sourcing in some amount of bakken it wont be anywhere near what we did the last time we had coker down which should effectively shut down a piece of the crude unit and run a very light slate closer to crudes weve got coming in but there will be – this economics to run  barrels a day of bakken into base because it carries heavy crude and well probably boost that up a little bit during this downtime paul sankey  wolfe research llc and how do the train economics look at these prices just the loss to  thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director you do not have economics on a total and average basis thats in fact why – again if you remember our course to move rail total and average all in about  dependent upon what you buy the crude for in the field last week the commercial folks were telling me that we might be  to  under brent but – im sorry under ti and if you got a  arb on it youre going to land it in at brent plus  or  thats a lot better than its been but we would normally not run that crude in delaware if we had the refinery running full because of the economics on the heavy crudes and the medium crudes would be better but with the coker down in fact it works paul sankey  wolfe research llc yeah got it and then the technicalities of buying iranian crude could you just – i mean i can understand theres an overall market impact i guess the iranian crude moves into europe and then it knocks out other equivalent blends to the benefit of you guys i mean you couldnt buy iranian crude directly could you thomas d omalley  executive chairman no paul sankey  wolfe research llc is that because of ships or   thomas d omalley  executive chairman no the us government regulation at the present time i dont think would allow us to bring in iranian crude but your analysis is correct most of their crude is going to go to their previous customer base in europe and it will simply back out other crudes paul sankey  wolfe research llc got you tom do you have a sense for how much incremental crude were going to see ive seen i think its about  a day going to total  a day going to eni in europe do you have any sense for  thomas d omalley  executive chairman yeah i think that – look the best we can do candidly is what you are doing the published reports on what they actually ship i think youre looking at  barrels a day or  barrels a day i think they got ready for this in advance they figured out that they were going to have a settlement getting it far above that i suspect will take quite a bit more time paul sankey  wolfe research llc great thank you everyone operator the next question comes from chi chow with tudor pickering holt chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thank you i guess back on the macro in the midwest what do you think is the underlying cause of the weak gasoline cracks there and the high inventory is demand particularly weak so far yeartodate or is this just preparations by the industry for extended turnarounds upcoming in the region thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director ill weigh in on that and then tom could add well first of all the midwest i think its safe to say and you all understand is that – and its not i dont believe because of the – lifting the crude export ban but the build out of the arteries  the logistics system has effectively had to therefore return to the mean so the days of the very wide arbs that let you run and still make money even with wintertime cracks are probably no longer there unless theres an operating problem in the padd were going back to where typically chicago and the midwest goes long in the wintertime on products that is indeed what has happened i think it was exacerbated as i said because frankly even chicago had very good cracks in the fourth quarter and so all of the refiners including us were running and then you started to see well youre running but the gasoline is not going to the consumer its going into a tank when that happens typically thats the old transfer of products – crude into products you start to see the impact on the crack but i think its transient youre getting a dump of wintertime gasoline the midwest market will transition earlier in fact the end of this month to lower rvp gasoline thats going to take butanes out of the pool and part of the pressure thats been put on it is people just getting rid of the wintertime gasoline because they realize that the marketplace is changing chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thanks tom and then on pbfx do you have any guidance on any sort of timing or level of possible midstream asset drops this year into the mlp and any thoughts on financing these transactions given the current state of the mlp market c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi chi its erik so i think at this point we obviously made the plains all american announcement last week we expect that to close in q we continue to evaluate buying thirdparty acquisitions or doing asset dropdowns clearly there is a lot of turmoil in the mlp equity markets we included some language in our press release that we do have the option of having pbf energy actually buy equity to complete the plains transaction weve got plenty of liquidity under our revolver and i think at this point were content based on having  times  times coverage with pbfx to continue down the growth path however i think were very cautious because issuing equity at these levels is not very attractive you ultimately have to have extremely low purchase multiples in order for the math to work chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc right and would the chalmette midstream assets be under consideration for kind of the next drop whenever that might occur c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president i think weve always said we dont have a preference as to what type of asset gets dropped were comfortable with our pool of  million of dropdown ebitda that sits at the parent doing transactions like plains we think are extremely attractive because it allows us to continue to keep that  million at the parent for future consideration but i dont think – we really dont provide any guidance in terms of what would be the next asset that comes down and from our perspective it could be any of the assets on the east coast that weve highlighted or any of the  million worth of assets that would come from chalmette or even torrance once we close that acquisition chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thanks erik i appreciate it operator our next question comes from jeff dietert with simmons jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international good morning thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director good morning c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international want to followup on a couple of popular topics this morning with the gasoline inventory builds could you talk a little bit about what type of material you think that is is it primarily winter grade material or are you stocking up high octane material to take advantage of summer driving season thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director pretty much – most of it is just winter grade material because as i said as what happened is in the fourth quarter with the margin environment that existed people increased the gasoline yield and ran hot and put wintertime gasoline in tank and at least certainly in the midwest when the demand fell off thats what i think has driven by the significant decrease in gas crash because people are now doing what theyve got to do to empty the tanks and get ready for the summer and the rest of the system there has been some gradual transitioning to getting ready for summertime gasoline and it is in the area of octane and low alkaline where you get low rvp type material that were seeing some build but predominantly its wintertime gas jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international thanks and then following up on chalmette i realize you only had it for two months during the quarter you reported  heavy feedstock  medium  light and  other is that a reasonable assumption going forward or do you anticipate moving towards more medium and heavy barrels as you go into  thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director thats a good question the answer is the second part we expect – given the market if the lightheavy dips remain where they are our view is that they will remain wide to incent to do that we will be moving more towards a mediumheavy slate we owned chalmette only for two months and the first month this crude slate that we ran was purchased by exxon and it was based on their system so it had a lot of hls in it still some of the crudes that we expected to be able to be moving out you have to run some light but you dont have to run as much as was being run so we actually think we will be given the economic situation that exists and if it remains moving towards a heavier slate in chalmette jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international got you and on the east coast youre down to only  light and traditionally youve run more like  light i think most of that at del city are there – is that a sustainable slate what are the restrictions on the east coast maybe more specifically at del city as to the minimum light crude runs thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah it is a sustainable slate as i said paulsboro basically can run full  mediumsheavies and in fact thats the way we ran in the fourth quarter delaware – its a function of just how heavy a heavy crude you buy we started running altamira and some of these crudes that are very heavy when we do that we actually need some light crude to carry it so we might run  barrels a day  barrels a day of light crude in fact the model says that we can run bakken in order to carry these heavy crudes when the arb moved open and the west african barrels became more attractive were actually looking at bringing in some light sweets from west africa but that has – its kind of corrected itself so i think well run  barrels a day to  barrels a day of light crude at delaware and mainly to allow us to carry what we consider to be very attractive heavy crude one of which is the m crude that were getting from venezuela which used to be run exclusively in chalmette but our models are telling us that in fact we actually get a better margin at running it in delaware so weve started moving some of that material to the delaware refinery it also helps us on freight economics with two porting and that stuff but to do that we need to run some light crude jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international thanks for your comments tom operator well take our next question from edward westlake with credit suisse edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yes congrats on the ebitda in the quarter just a question on chalmette and torrance first in your opening remarks you said that based on the due diligence and the operational performance that you see upside i mean im just looking at your chart of  million of chalmette and  million from torrance and then i hear in your comments about  million to  million of ebitda at chalmette from the restarts obviously with some capital spend to get there maybe just give us a sense of what that opening comments about those two assets perhaps been better means in terms of dollars and cents thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director well i will tell you tom made the comments that these are two of the more attractive assets that he had seen in a number of many refineries that he has acquired i would echo that kind of reminds us of bayway back when i first started working with tom an underutilized asset particularly chalmette product of a bad marriage and a joint venture with upside potential so i think yeah we said  million that  million if we are right in our view particularly on the capability of bringing the hydrocracker back either as a hydrocracker or as a gas or hydro treated there is a number of different options that were looking at and that  million of ebitda a high percentage of that is likely going to the additive to the  million but its going to take some time its going to take some money and we havent fully landed on either of those two things yet edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and then anything on torrance you mentioned the due diligence seemed to be going well in terms of understanding that asset versus your initial projections thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah torrance first of all were getting very good cooperation from exxonmobil on torrance it was a little bit problematic and we were somewhat concerned on chalmette but that was because it was the jv they are anxious most of the efforts that were focusing in right now ed are on the commercial side there are going to – weve got a lot of people knocking on our doors crc the california resources got a lot of california heavy crude so were really trying to get our arms mostly around the commercial opportunities that we think are there we think there are going to be some – what we do with the steel thats probably down the road the key to torrance is i think everybody on this call probably knows we have to make sure we can run it safely reliably and in an environmentally responsible manner that has been the challenge for the site were very hopeful that the significant amount of investment that has been put into that over the last two years will in fact correct some of the throughput  problems of that but thats what were going to focus on commercial and getting it to run right edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and then my second question is really around funding obviously the market is worried about recession youve got cash going out the door for torrance which will reduce your cash balance the mlp market is up as weve already discussed facing some issues so maybe just talk about how you plan to run the balance sheet say over the next one year to two years c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president ed i think overall weve been fairly consistent in our message that we would like to longerterm keep net debt to cap below  thats still our longterm goal weve got the rating agencies on board with that i think today weve got  billion or  billion of overall liquidity once we complete the torrance acquisition we think we will probably use between  million and  million worth of liquidity to actually go and purchase the assets as well as the hydrocarbon inventory and other parts of working capital but thats a big reason why we were in the capital markets in the fourth quarter raising  million so i think were fairly confident with the ability to close torrance during the second quarter and longerterm i think the focus will be on managing the balance sheet in the most conservative manner that keeps us kind of inside of that longterm net debt to cap while at the same time maintaining enough flexibility to go out and do what we think we do pretty well which is uncover opportunities that other folks may not have lineofsight on i think thats really the key for us thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director one thing id add is we were somewhat lucky at least in chalmette and it appears as though we might be in torrance when we model those acquisitions we model them in a much higher crude price or product price and the working capital burden of chalmette was quite a bit lower and right now it would be the same especially if we hit this timing in may  at torrance edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator our next question comes from ryan todd with deutsche bank ryan todd  deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning everybody maybe if i could followup on a couple earlier ones i appreciate the color that you gave on the potential to bring units back on at chalmette and the growth capex if we look at the results youve seen so far your results have clearly exceeded expectations some of that might be from stronger headline cracks than you had in your original view but it appears also that even in excess of the cracks you guys have probably exceeded our expectations your guidance with the stronger capture rate can you talk a little bit about what has driven the strong results todate how sustainable those are as well thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director the latter part – well yeah let me just comment in addition to a very good crack which you tell us what the crack will be and well tell you how sustainable it is but as we said our view is that therell be some balance back here a little bit but that gasoline is going to continue to be the horse that pulls the wagon and we expect to have a favorable – weve got to get through this period whatever it is the other thing that helped us and continues to help and i think is sustainable is what we talked about a little bit earlier the lightmedium lightheavy diffs wide especially as tom says on a percentage basis the indications from a supply standpoint iran et cetera i would say that suggest that that has the probability of continuing so in fact in response to earlier question we expect to actually increase the amount of medium sours that were going to be running at chalmette which should further improve the operation so short answer – it wasnt a short answer but yes we think its sustainable ryan todd  deutsche bank securities inc thank you thanks thats helpful and then maybe one more you mentioned in the press release and a couple times in your comments about the ability that you have now to kind of run particularly the east coast and chalmette together as more of an integrated system to maximize profitability can you talk a little bit about – i guess about what that means on a granular point of view what are the opportunities that you have that you see right now to run that as kind of an integrated system and what are maybe some opportunities in the future that you see to maximize that thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director the most obvious one that were seeing right now is on the crude side delaware doesnt have the best logistics for bringing in crude by water we have draft restrictions so we oftentimes sit out in delaware bay lightering vessels to get them to where they can get into the dock with chalmette and delaware city being able to run essentially very similar crudes we are now sourcing crudes on larger vessels bringing them into chalmettes dock unloading them and then bringing them directly in to delaware city or in fact in some cases directly into paulsboro so the crude flexibility that we have is something that were taking advantage of and we will continue to that will be a synergy between the east coast assets particularly delaware and chalmette other areas that share naphtha cargoes things of that nature so most of its on the commercial bench just being taking advantage of the ability on freight but also by and large the cargos of naphtha as opposed to smaller cargoes and getting them into both sites ryan todd  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks thats very helpful operator well take our next question from paul cheng with barclays paul cheng  barclays capital inc hey guys good morning thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director good morning c erik young  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning paul cheng  barclays capital inc tom on chalmette i know that you guys are going to look at the operation i know that but in the shortterm for the next several quarters just curious that can we use the fourth quarter as essentially the baseline for the unit cost and margin capture rate or that there are some oneoff item in the quarter that we need to make adjustment thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director there is really nothing unusual in the two months that we ran it was a relatively smooth operation obviously a strong crack you guys will make the determination on what you think the crack will be when you look at capture rate i would have to go back and look at it i suspect if we run right and we get some benefit from the heavier crude that we might be able to tweak that up a little bit from – whatd we run around  capture rate in the first two months very nice capture rate but again in a low flat crude environment you should start to see that ability so i dont think youd go wrong using the same high capture rate assuming the dips are there maybe it will be up a little bit paul cheng  barclays capital inc so thats no inventory or anything that we should be concerned seeing that mix the fourth quarter so far the margin capture way look better or worse so thats actually if we have a similar margin environment in lightheavy differential that you will expect the capture rate will be similar thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yes i dont think there was anything anomalous in the fourth quarter that was an accounting or an inventory effect that was there so frankly again if you stick with this low price environment again that is an advantage but if thats the situation i would – that would be our expectation paul cheng  barclays capital inc sure and just curious that on the december energy bill supposed to have a tax credit  per bill for the east coast refinery i never fully understand on that and just wanted to make sure that – is that fully offset the additional cost of jones act compared to a foreign flag if youre going to ship oil lets say from the gulf coast up to the east coast thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director the original intent was to try to see if that could at least offset some of the pain of northeast refiners of being put at a potentially competitive disadvantage on the jones act versus people who are loading crude in corpus christi and taking it to canada but that  credit never really got to the finish line it was actually much lower than that and in fact to be perfectly candid the way the law was written it really doesnt even exist as a credit is that fair to say matthew matthew c lucey  president yeah its classic washington they tried to put language in there that was going to be a small benefit to refiners but as is currently written it actually needs to be amended a bit to actually take hold so were not as simple as washington were not counting on anything from it we might be able to get a minor boost from a tax perspective but its nothing worth modeling paul cheng  barclays capital inc so we should not build that in and assume that you guys will be never paying through  you actually will be able to ship crude from the gulf coast up to the east coast in the equipment price matthew c lucey  president absolutely not paul cheng  barclays capital inc i see okay thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah we have much better economics on waterborne foreign crudes and  paul cheng  barclays capital inc so what is the current – do you get any tax credit at all or not at all matthew c lucey  president we can explain it offline its not a tax credit it has to do with incremental tax deductions but like i said its not worth modeling at this point and were happy to discuss it but i dont want to bog down this call paul cheng  barclays capital inc okay that would be great thank you operator well take our next question from doug leggate with bank of america merrill lynch doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning everybody tom – either tom i wonder if you could give us your perspective on how long you think this winter gasoline overhang takes to clean up and maybe just a kind of addon to that why have the step up in exports – theres obviously been another major change in the industry – not helped alleviate at least part of the problem that were seeing right now ive got a quick followup please thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director ill give you – this is little tom one of the things in terms of how quickly it could alleviate lets put this in perspective pbf has basically a system that can swing about  to  of its clean products production between distillate and gasoline through the various steps and other refiners are probably – could be plus or minus on that but if you use a number  and you go back to the fourth quarter where you had this very favorable bullish gasoline environment and a distillate overhang and everybody cranked up and took that  on a  million barrel a day production base thats  its a significant increase in gasoline production and then frankly i dont think there was poor demand i just think we cranked all of the distillate turned it into gasoline and we started to see some builds right now everybody is going to reverse that or certainly were going to reverse it i cant say what everybody else is going to do but well go back and say well thats not the right way to run the system when you look at the current gasoline cracks the model tells you youre not going to run it that way so i dont think its going to take that long youve got a combination of people who are going to be dialing back on a gdd production youre going to have summertime gasoline which is going to take all the lpgs out of the gasoline pool and then some folks including us are decreasing production particularly in the midwest right now although you saw trainer  is also – delta airlines is cutting their economics based on waterborne crudes so i dont think it will take that long – i could be wrong – to correct on the export side i can only say that some of the stuff ive read is they think that perhaps some of the weather related problems in gulf coast have restricted exports but im not the expert in that area thomas d omalley  executive chairman just commenting on that if you expect the government to make the right decision in terms of crude oil exports and that was going to be the magic bullet thats really unrealistic you are still getting exports of very light material but the system is not there and its all driven by economics and we dont see that the ability to export is going to cure the us market from a pricing point of view doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thanks fellas my followup im afraid is a repeat on torrance i guess i just wanted to understand properly is torrance running as you understand it today and whats behind my question is obviously west coast like everywhere else is – the margins upcoming quite a bit so im just wondering what the dynamics going into summer could look like in that market if torrance comes back given the margins are already weak with torrance offline ill leave it there thanks thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director yeah torrance – they did have – i guess here in the last month they shut down their crude unit they have one crude unit for a short period of time but principally has been running at significantly reduced rates and basically producing a bunch of intermediates and very – some finished products from the reformer and some of the other units but a lot of intermediates one to your point when the charges of gasoline machine as you know the fcc a lot of fcc so youre going to see a pretty significant margins there increase in gasoline out of torrance right now the crack is coming as it has everywhere but the reality is gasoline demand yearoveryear in california in last year versus  was up rather significantly and if you look at the vehicle miles traveled indications is continuing to be there so even with torrance coming up the base supplydemand situation in california does not look like its problematic to us and california is a place where you can move along when everything is running well and make a little bit of money or some amount of money but the history of the state is one is a problem in a refinery unfortunately for exxonmobil  period of time is where if you run properly you can do extremely well doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thanks fellas i appreciate the answers operator and we can take a followup from chi chow please go ahead chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thanks just one followup can you quantify the breakeven medium and heavy crude discounts on a percentage basis for your system and does that breakeven differ by refinery thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director wed have to get back to you on the system you can work out with colin but yes the second piece is very clear thats why we have these linear models and the breakeven will move around and so its difficult to say exactly what they are over a longer period of time we can look at them at any spot time and run it through the model and it will say yes heres your breakeven economics but that changes with the spread between gasoline distillate it changes with octane moving out the jet premium its fairly complicated so we couldnt give you something that we would feel that you should run with over an extended period of time as a percentage chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc tom do you have any just sort of rule of thumb do you need a  or  discount on maya versus light or something lower for medium crudes anything just to kind of get a feel thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director id like to try to help you out but really no again its just a little bit too complicated for us to give you something and we might be misleading you as tom says its percentage based so youve got to look at it at a point in time and youve got to look at the whole macroeconomic environment – not macro but specific economic environment and match it up to the hardware and the refinery to be able to do that and thats why we run lps chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thanks operator and ladies and gentlemen weve reached the end of our allotted time ill now turn the call back to tom nimbley for closing remarks thomas j nimbley  chief executive officer  director all right we certainly appreciate your time thanks for your participation and everybody have a good day operator okay and ladies
