longshort funds after a disappointing period of performance funds and performance although over the last  months the aum across the group decreased it should be noted that  of our  strategies saw net inflows over the year which gives us confidence we can enjoy another period of strong growth once our japanese business stabilises shortterm returns across our funds have been somewhat mixed but the longterm performance figures remain excellent with  out of  of our ucits funds outperforming their benchmarks net of all costs since launch there have been some exceptional performers over the period notably our uk absolute fund and insurance fund both of which delivered top decile returns over the period results nevertheless pretax profits before share based payments fell to £m from £m in the prior year core pretax profit fell from £m to £m net performance fees decreased from £m to £m although this was our fifteenth successive year of generating such fees our balance sheet remains strong with net assets of £m  £m including net cash of £m  £m market background whereas in recent years markets have generally proved supportive our last financial year to  march  was rather different with a number of the major stock markets around the world posting doubledigit falls in local currency terms only in the us did we not see significant falls over the year with the sp index down  elsewhere the declines were more material with the uk ftse all share down  the nikkei  down  the msci emerging markets index down  and the msci europe index down  market movements were dominated by two major factors over the year the first was the strength of the us economy and its implications for when and how quickly the federal reserve would increase interest rates the second was the weakness of the chinese economy and the machinations of the chinese stock market the us economy was looking increasingly robust as  progressed raising the prospect of the first federal reserve rate hike since  the us consumer was buoyed by improving job prospects real wage increases rising house prices and the meaningful boost to their spending power resulting from the collapse in the oil price the federal reserve had been expected to raise rates in september but the dramatic gyrations of the chinese stock market in august and fears over a hard landing for the chinese economy led to a heavy sell off in stock markets around the world in late summer as a result of this global uncertainty the federal reserve to the surprise of a number of commentators decided to keep rates on hold in september and through the autumn markets recovered their poise as the chinese stock market stabilised and the news on the chinese economy was not as bad as feared in the summer by december the federal reserve felt the global outlook had recovered sufficiently for it to increase rates a quarter point given that the us domestic economy was still looking strong the new year brought with it another round of jitters on the chinese economy and large falls in the chinese stock market once again leading to a sharp sell off in stock markets around the world with data on the us economy becoming more mixed during the opening quarter of the calendar year expectations of further us rate rises had ratcheted back considerably by the end of our financial year allowing most major markets to recover some of their earlier losses developments we added to our product range in the summer of  with the launch of our european ex uk income fund a natural development for our pan european income manager nick davis and his team the european central bank ecb continues to pursue its policy of quantative easing qe which distorts the bond market both in government and corporate bonds denying bond buyers the level of interest they would anticipate in a more normalised economic and interest rate cycle as the search for yield and income is likely to continue we expect uk investors will expand their search towards continental european equities where some attractive yields can still be found although no new teams arrived during the financial year we were pleased to announce at our aum update statement in early april that the highly regarded uk value team of george godber and georgina hamilton will be joining us the team has developed a strong following amongst our uk clients with their disciplined value investment process which has delivered excellent absolute relative and risk adjusted returns over recent years we look forward to them building us a multiproduct uk value franchise over the next five years and beyond awards the following funds all picked up awards during the year asia financials global insurance income opportunities north america healthcare opportunities global technology and the technology trust at the inaugural investment weeks specialist investment awards in november we picked up all three of the specialist sector fund awards winning financials with our global insurance fund healthcare with our healthcare opportunities fund and technology with our global technology fund dividend as previously stated the board believes that the level of dividend should reflect the companys trading results its cash resources and also its future prospects the board has declared a second interim dividend of p  p to be paid in july together with the interim dividend of p paid in january  the total dividend for the year amounts to p this is unchanged from the previous year despite the fall in aum and earnings per share and reflects the strength of the companys balance sheet and our continued confidence in the longterm outlook for the company outlook there are no doubt substantial challenges facing the global economy and no shortage of political risk as well to contend with this year the brexit vote looks finely balanced at the time of writing and this will be followed by what is likely to be one of the most vitriolic us presidential campaigns ever ahead of the vote on  november  the european union eu continues to face significant economic and political challenges economic growth across the block remains muted although germany spain and ireland are bright spots  six years on from the most recent greek crisis little seems to have been resolved there and arguably the situation is worse today with the additional challenge of the refugee crisis the refugee issue is posing a serious political and economic challenge not only for greece but also for many individual governments within the eu and for the eu itself at a federal level major issues remain within the european banking sector in response to the sustained weakness of the euro area economy and persistent deflationary pressures the ecb has pushed rates further into negative territory and expanded its qe program again the bank of japan followed the ecbs lead and introduced negative interest rates although this failed to halt a resurgence of the yen over recent months economic data from the us has been more mixed of late whilst the outlook for the rest of the global economy remains murky with china continuing to slow japan back in recession europe remaining sluggish and the uk flagging ahead of the brexit vote perhaps on a more positive note us interest rates are not likely to increase as quickly as expected at the start of the year and elsewhere it is difficult to envisage anything other than a continuation of loose monetary policy either from the ecb the bank of japan or the authorities in china whilst the bank of england is unlikely to increase rates anytime soon regardless of the brexit outcome i expect markets to make little headway until there is greater clarity and resolution on some of the major economic and political uncertainties exercising investors and there could be a considerable amount of volatility in the interim  the prospects for the group are likely to remain restrained in the near term as a result  with the addition of new teams and the ongoing strength in a good number of our strategies we believe the group remains well placed to generate aum and earnings growth over the longer term annual general meeting the annual general meeting will again this year be held at  palace street london swe jd at pm on  july  and i would encourage shareholders to attend and meet the directors full details of the meeting are given in the separate notice of annual

we announced an evolution of our strategy expanding our targeted number of teams from a range of  to  to  to  this was the first change in strategy we have made since the group was founded  years ago despite the lack of progress we have made in terms of aum and profits growth over the last two years the group has continued to invest in new teams and in the business with further investment in client service operations and support staff and systems  this reflects our strategy of continuing to offer a diversified product range for our clients supported by a robust and scalable infrastructure  with our investment led culture active fund management talent continues to see us as an attractive destination in an increasingly challenging industry few talented investment managers would wish to set up on their own in the current environment given the escalating cost and complexity of the regulatory environment in addition the capital investment required into operations client service personnel and support systems to meet the necessary demands of many of todays clients is substantial there is also the simple fact of human nature  many investment managers prefer a collegiate environment of likeminded talent we see no change to these secular shifts in the industry with regulatory and client servicing costs continuing to rise these shifts will likely drive further consolidation in the industry which would most probably accelerate if market conditions remained poor for an extended period when we established polar capital in  we set out with the aim of creating an environment which would attract and retain talented active managers the talent we have assembled and the longevity of many of those teams is testimony to the model we provide and the investment led culture we have tried to create recently we announced that we had secured the services of a th team a highly rated uk value team with the addition of this team we reached the upper limit of our original target range for teams set all those years ago ironically we reached the limit at a time when we are being approached by more managers and teams than at any point in our history what seemed an ambitious target for team numbers when we started has now been achieved and this has caused us to reflect on whether we should stick with the original target or set a new target we decided on the latter as we believe we have the facilities people and systems to support further teams and the culture to do so as well funds and teams it was disappointing to experience the level of outflows we saw on our japan emerging markets and european longshort funds over the year the technology team also saw net outflows but on a very small scale we do though take encouragement from the fact that despite the generally difficult market conditions  of our  teams saw net inflows over the period they were healthcare financials north america global european income global convertibles and uk absolute whilst the value style of our japan and european longshort teams may remain out of favour for a while longer we believe the emerging markets income ucits fund and the technology ucits fund are well placed to grow assets again if market sentiment turns more positive we therefore see plenty of opportunity for growth within the existing product set the addition of the uk value team of george godber and georgina hamilton will provide significant further growth potential in calendar  and beyond and there are likely to be some additional products from our present teams within that timescale too challenges and opportunities ironically the issues we have had on japan have resulted in the business being better diversified today than at any point in our history although it is not the route we would ideally have chosen to achieve such a level of diversification the japan funds as a percentage of our aum peaked at around  but had fallen to  by the year end fractionally below the north america funds at  of aum it seems to be a major challenge within the industry to achieve growth without becoming overly reliant on a single strategy or team much larger competitors than us have had to grapple with the issue whilst smaller competitors inevitably have high concentration risks around a single strategy or team often in excess of  despite the undoubted challenges within the industry we also see tremendous opportunities as well some of the larger competitors struggle to provide a consistent and enjoyable environment for talented active managers to thrive and lack transparent models in terms of their remuneration some of the smaller boutiques are struggling to gain critical mass and cope with the growing burden complexity and cost of regulation and the increasing demands of clients whilst still being open to opportunistic opportunities we intend to evolve to incorporate a greater level of strategic planning in our development over the coming years we will look to strengthen the senior management team and continue investing in support personnel and systems and the opening up of new markets geographically and by type of client we serve our push into the institutional marketplace remains nascent and although we have been successful historically in raising assets from us clients for hedge fund products we have never made a concerted effort on the long only side of our business in terms of new team additions we will keep an open mind although strategically we would like to expand our global product capabilities particularly in the institutional market place we would also like to add additional resource on asia and expand our product offering beyond our current asia financials fund which despite its excellent long term performance record has limited appeal within our client base given its specialist nature regulation we all have an interest in operating in a serious and wellrespected regulatory environment  such an environment ensures a fair and level playing field between competitors and engenders trust and security for clients both domestically and overseas the financial conduct authority fca is doing an excellent job on many fronts in what is undoubtedly a very challenging environment however it is also vital that regulation does not become too parochial and thereby put the large elements of the uk fund management industry that operate globally at a competitive disadvantage to our north american and asian competitors we have already experienced this in relation to the fcas policy on corporate access which has put us at a disadvantage to our us competitors in terms of meeting company management in the us this disadvantage has not yet become material but it could become so if regulation were to continue to evolve in a manner that does not take account of the globally competitive market in which many both small and large uk fund management companies operate finally i wish to thank our shareholders for their understanding patience and support through this rather extended period of consolidation i can assure you we are working hard across the organisation and at a board level to get back in a position where we can deliver the growth in profits and dividends we had all previously anticipated tjwoolley  june      financial review   results of the year profits for the year are lower than in  revenues have fallen and although costs have also reduced they have not fallen sufficiently to protect the groups profits the analysis below explains the reasons for each variance starting with revenues revenues  march  £m  march  £m net management fees net of commissions and fees payable   performance fees   other income   total revenues £m £m   the fall in aum from the last year end to this year end is the cause of a lower year on year average of aum this accounts for the decrease in net management fees received over the year the decrease in performance fees received is a reflection of the weaker performance of some of the groups products over the year  other income the return on the groups balance sheet investments is unchanged from last year costs  march  £m  march  £m salaries bonuses and other staff costs   manager distributions   compensation costs   nic on share options   other operating costs   core operating costs   performance fee interests   total operating costs £m £m   total operating costs fell to £m from £m last year  the small decrease in salaries bonuses and other staff costs was despite a small increase in head count in the firm a product of reduced discretionary bonus pool being paid out due to the years lower profits the decrease in core distributions was a function of the fall in management fee revenues and the management fee profitability of the firm the national insurance cost relating to the groups conventional share option plan has returned to a more normal figure last years cost had been flagged as abnormal due to the increased quantity of options that became able to vest that year over half of the increase in operating costs to £m from £m is a combination of an increase in rent and rates and bloomberg terminal costs the increase in rent and rates was flagged last year when we stated that the move into our new premises would result from april  in a £m per annum increase in rent and rates the fall in performance fee interests to £m from £m in  is directly correlated to the reduction in performance fee revenues profits  march  £m  march  £m core operating profit   performance fee profit   interest and similar income   profit before sharebased payments and tax   sharebased payments   profit before tax £m £m   the headline profit before tax for the year has decreased to £m from last years £m the group believes that the best measure of the groups profitability is the profit before share based payments as detailed more fully below and tax on this basis the group shows a fall in profits to £m compared to last years £m the decrease can be attributed as follows •  core operating profits the decrease in profits reflects the reduction in management fee revenues driven by the decrease in average value of assets managed over the year •  performance fee profits weaker performance across the product range compared to  has resulted in the reduction in performance fee profits •  interest and similar income this contribution of profits has remained stable   sharebased payments the face of the consolidated income statement includes a line titled sharebased payments which accounts for a charge of £m  £m the figures are brokendown as follows      march  £m  march  £m cost attributed to preference shares   cost attributed to conventional options   total cost of sharebased payments £m £m   the increase in this charge is dominated by the increase in the charge associated with the groups preference shares arrangement which is explained below earnings per share the effect that the charge for sharebased payments has on the eps figures of the group is as follows    march  pence  march  pence diluted earnings per share   impact of share based payments   adjusted diluted earnings per share p p   preference shares part of the groups business model since  is a share based method of providing fund managers an economic interest in their funds in keeping with the entrepreneurial philosophy of the group a separate class of preference share is issued by polar capital partners limited for purchase by each new team of fund managers on their arrival at the firm these shares provide each team with an economic interest in the funds that they run and ultimately enable the teams to convert their interest in the revenues generated from their funds into equity in polar capital holdings plc the equity is awarded in return for the forfeiture of their current core economic interest and is issued over three years with the full quantum of the dilution being reflected in the diluted share count and so diluted eps from the point of conversion the event has been designed to be at both the actual and the diluted levels earnings enhancing to shareholders in the year to  march  as was also the case in the year to march  there were no new conversions of preference shares into polar capital holdings equity as at  march  three sets of preference shares have the ability to call for a conversion the call has to be made on or before  november  if any conversion is to take place with effect from  march  it is the relative success and profitability of the funds represented by these three sets of preference shares that accounts for the increase cost attributed to preference shares that has been identified above  £m versus  £m balance sheet and cash at the year end the cash balances of the group were £m  £m the increase was mainly a product of the reduction over the year in the groups portfolio of seed investments at the balance sheet date the group held £m of seed investments in its funds  £m capital management the group believes in retaining a strong balance sheet the capital that is retained in the business is used either to seed new investment products or if not so required is invested into the groups absolute return funds as investment capital as at march  there were no pure investments but £m of the groups balance sheet was invested to seed fledgling funds business risk there are a number of risks and uncertainties faced by the group which are more fully described later in the strategic report amongst the major risks to the business strategy is the loss of assets under management due to markets falling poor investment performance or the loss of key investment personnel these events will not only have an immediate impact on the management fees earned by the group but also deprive the group of possible performance fees going concern the financial reporting council has determined that all companies should carry out a rigorous assessment of all the factors affecting the business in deciding to adopt a going concern basis for the preparation of the accounts the directors have reviewed and examined the financial and other processes embedded in the business in particular the annual budget process and the financial stress testing inherent in the internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap on the basis of such review and the significant liquid assets underpinning the balance sheet relative to the groups predictable operating cost profile the directors consider that the adoption of a going concern basis covering a period of at least  months from the date of this report is appropriate   john mansell finance director  june        consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended  march     march  £  march  £ revenue

healthy relationships dogs trained through  paws meet the criteria for ‘service animals’ as defined by the americans with disabilities act ada these dogs serve in diverse areas • diabetic alert • seizure alert • hearing assistance • autism assistance • mobility assistance • multipurpose assistance • ptsd assistance • assistance for children with fetal alcohol • syndrome disorder fasddrug exposure the  paws journey begins with an inhouse breeding program that produces healthy dogs with the behavioral profile needed to succeed as an assistance animal the dogs are accustomed to human interaction from their first day of life staff and volunteers assist in the whelping rooms and continuously monitor the new litters as soon as the puppies are weaned they are moved to the puppy house this is a popular volunteer opportunity imagine walking into a house full of puppies spending hours playing and cuddling with them puppies soon begin public socialization this is a critical time in a puppy’s development puppies under careful supervision are slowly exposed to various stimuli  crowds grass leashes service dog vests  to acclimate them to life as a service dog they are then moved out of the puppy house and into the care of a puppy raiser some of our dogs enter a traditional foster home setting with volunteers who commit not only to the raising of a puppy that is not their own but also to the challenging and rewarding task of exposing that puppy to the widest possible number of socialization opportunities other dogs spend time at one of four ohio correctional facilities we use for foursix weeks learning basic obedience potty training and crate training by vetted inmates who attend a weekly class with a  paws trainer other puppies join the  paws university program currently  paws partners with  universities within a threehour radius of the facility student organizations are established on these campuses to foster several dogs at a time often in teams that allow for greater diversity in the puppies’ experiences college campuses provide an enormous variety of socialization opportunities from classroom environments important for those dogs who will serve a schoolaged child to sporting events many of our  paws dogs have walked with their college fosters across the stage as the students receive their diplomas the students love the chance to share this important achievement with their foster pup who helped make their college experience so memorable and rewarding around one year of age the professional training staff at  paws evaluate each dog to determine if the dog meets the strict criteria necessary to continue in advanced training some dogs are not selected for advanced training at this point they are made available for adoption the  paws team likes to call these dogs the ‘fabulous flunkies’  loving dogs who fell just short of the narrow standards needed for service doghood many happy dog owners have found their perfect companion  and many happy dogs have found ‘forever homes’  through the adoption program the dogs who continue in the advanced training program begin rigorous instruction with the training staff it is here the dog is trained for the specific task that will serve their ‘match’  the child or veteran who has been on their own journey while their service dog in training has been working so hard the dog you see is only half the team while the dog has been learning everything from ‘sit’ to ‘leave it’ to the intricate training required to alert a potential medical crisis the recipient of the dog has been busy service dogs are not covered by most insurance plans and a fully trained service dog through  paws costs between  families who have been approved by  paws are asked to pay or fundraise  except veterans who are completely free  paws provides promotional assistance and training during the fundraising process most families have multiple events during their fundraising period some families raise the required amount others find they raise enough money to cover the full cost of the dog excess funds are administered through  paws to families who may have fallen short during the fundraising process adhering to one of the most fundamental principles of the  paws mission no one approved through the  paws application process is denied because of the inability to pay the final steps of the journey are made together by the child or veteran with disabilities and the service dog who has been trained as their companion the final two weeks of training show the recipient how to work with and begin life with a new service dog during this time the bonding process begins  the start of a lifetime partnership between human and canine a graduation ceremony at the end of the training allows the puppy raisers and the new service dog families to celebrate the successful completion of the training process connecting individuals who were impacted by the raising and training of these dogs
