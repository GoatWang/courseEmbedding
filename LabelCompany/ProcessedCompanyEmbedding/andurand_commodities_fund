discretionary commodity trading firm led by highprofile exbluegold and vitol man pierre andurand is on a roll right now after correctly positioning its portfolio to profit from the late tumble in the oil price that caught many other investors offguard pierre andurand recent months have seen a dramatic fall in the price of oil following a prolonged bull run – a downturn that was both rapid and for many traders and investors unexpected while many market participants including hedge funds were wrongfooted to their cost wellknown and experienced oil trader pierre andurand had positioned his twoyearold andurand commodities fund specifically to exploit the price fall andurand’s shrewd assessment of the oil markets and his judgement that the market was oversupplied while demand had cooled

betting iran will increase production after reaching agreement with the us and european union over sanctions tied to its nuclear program and that a nov  meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries that will decide whether to reduce production won’t go far enough some hedge funds profit from steep decline in oil prices wsj  november  mr andurand shorted oil in early october as it became clear to him that saudi arabia the world’s biggest crudeoil exporter was unlikely to cut output sharply to shore up prices “over my career i’ve been long more than i’ve been short but that’s because we’ve been in a market that’s going up” mr andurand said referring to bets on both rising and falling oil prices “you have to be agnostic i try not to be limited by any longterm view the market has changed” reuterscnbc  october  reuters  pierre andurand one of the most respected and successful fund managers in the oil industry said he believed us light crude oil could fall as low as  per barrel the us benchmark oil price also known as wti will be volatile but assuming no more supply disruptions i think we can overshoot down to  a barrel andurand told reuters on the sidelines of the oil  money conference on wednesday the move will mainly be in the front of the curve but not just the first three months  the first six months or so he said adding that brent would come down as well  andurand told the oil and money conference that he thought it unlikely that opec would cut production even though current supply and demand trends suggested the market could be in a  million barrelperday surplus next year opec which is really saudi kuwait uae could take the heat between them and cut  million bpd next year then another  million next year then another  million  months after that he said but if they did that prices would rise and us output would keep growing and wed keep seeing large efficiency gains  us production growth has to slow down otherwise there will need to be more supply disruptions in large producing countries he added supply growth has been higher than expected  the period of stable oil prices weve had over the last three or so years has really been by chance with supply disruptions masking this shale oil production we are going to be in a bear market  i think we go lower before we go higher he declined to say whether his fund was currently shorting

strategy of the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund includes a quantitative strategic indexbased approach to commodity investing exposure to  commodities that can individually be long or flat if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash the ability to make position changes intramonth based on trends monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract why invest in the fund the longflat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable longonly commodity indices has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position
