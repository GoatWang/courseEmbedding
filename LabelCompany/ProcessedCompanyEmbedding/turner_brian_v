of our website we encourage you to go to our website and bring up the accompanying powerpoint slides so that you may follow along with us with that let me turn the call over to dave cole david w cole over the last seven years coinstar has evolved in to the category captain for the th wall today’s announcement of our intent to acquire the remaining equity stake in redbox we have taken yet another step in that evolution as many of you know when i arrived here in  we were a one product company in a single channel and at that time our revenue was  million with ebitda of about  million just seven years later coinstar has a platform of technology customer relationships field operations and infrastructure that reaches  countries and  points of presence and all of this has translated in to significantly higher revenue and ebitda in  we had our best year ever in terms of revenue ebitda and installations and in  we expect revenue to be over  billion with ebitda just shy of  million well ahead of plan of course not everything is perfect but against the current economic background our bundle of products and services is delivering superior value to retailers and consumers we’ve come this far because we’ve formulated a strategy that appeals to both retailers and consumers and we’ve assembled the right team of people committed to excellent execution this strategy combined cyclical and counter cyclical product lines and include early stage adolescent and mature businesses and includes home grown as well as acquired product lines but as a whole we believe coinstar’s th wall business model is our growth engine and has the relevance and durability to deliver results to stockholders for years to come this is my last conference call as ceo of coinstar so before turning the reins over to paul i want to thank our dedicated employees our loyal customers and our shareholders who i’ve gotten to know over the years it has been a privilege to lead this organization since  and i know the company has exceptionally strong management as coinstar embarks on its next stage of growth thanks to all of you for making the experience a special one with that i will turn the call over to paul paul d davis on behalf of everyone at coinstar i want to pass along our heartfelt thanks for your leadership over the years a strong foundation has been developed over the past several years and we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to grow not only the company’s revenues but also its profitability well beyond where it is today that’s the opportunity that i saw when i came here and i have a great deal of enthusiasm and confidence in our unique business model and our future our vision for coinstar is to be the leading supplier of valuable services that make life easier for consumers generate strong returns for our retail partners and provide robust value creation for our shareholders coinstar was founded on a truly innovative idea of turning consumer change in to cash conveniently and at a self service kiosk over time the company has not only expanded its footprint and product lines but we’ve leveraged our expertise to bring incremental value to consumers and retailers at the front of the store we will continue to innovate focusing on consumers’ needs and we will look both inside and outside the company to add even greater value to our th wall offering as you expect from an incoming ceo i’m looking in depth at our overall business model and at each of our product lines and specifically i’m looking for relevance and value as it relates to our retailers i’m also looking at crossing selling potential and short and long term trends i’m reviewing how we will organize the revenue and cost synergies we’ve achieved and finally i am looking at the value we have the ability to create for our shareholders now let’s turn to the business of the moment looking at chart one for the year ended december   coinstar posted record consolidated annual revenues with record ebitda we generated  of gaap eps and  of adjusted eps we installed more coin units in  than any year in our history in just over three years we now have a dvd kiosk network that rivals our coin network in terms of size and profitability and has more physical locations for consumers than any dvd rental operator in the us and we exceeded the revenue and ebitda guidance we provided at the beginning of the year as shown in chart two we outperformed some product lines offset by lower than expected results in others specifically our dvd kiosk business performed very well coin entertainment money transfer and epay all were affected by the economy however we believe they performed fairly well all things considered now let me take a deeper dive on each of our product lines starting with the dvd kiosk space today we announced our intent to purchase getamovie or gam’s  equity stake in redbox automated retail llc for those of you who are unfamiliar gam is a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdonalds corporation in addition to acquiring mcdonald’s share we expect to exercise our right to acquire the remaining interest owned by other minority holders brian will go through the financial details shortly we entered in to this agreement for two simple reasons first the return on investment and second redbox’s attractive growth characteristics to that point if you turn to charts four through  we are seeing some exceptional trends in the current environment as shown in chart five  pro forma dvd revenues increased  to approximately  million with  pro forma ebitda increasing approximately  to  million these results were driven by approximately  net installs for the fourth quarter on the heels of  through the first three quarters of the year between dvdxpress and redbox we now have over  units installed and our same store sales growth for the full year  was  factors driving success continue to be strong installations the terrific unit economics which i’ll revisit in a moment and the counter cyclical nature of dvd rentals to the economy as shown in chart six through eight utilizing the coinstar sales force redbox as seen an exceptional installation pace over the last there years resulting in redbox having by our estimates more than twice as many locations as the next largest dvd rental operators and more than five times as many locations deployed in the next leading kiosk operator as for  we expect redbox to install in the vicinity of  to  new units up from our prior expectation of  to  kiosks this will bring our total to over  units by the end of  twice our original expectations when we made our initial investment in  these increases are being driven by escalating retailer demand and the consumers desire to find a more convenient alternative to brick and mortar locations without sacrificing quality in terms of how those installations affect financial performance we expect our dvd revenues to increase about  in  to between  to  million with corresponding ebitda of  to  these margins reflect a network mix that’s skewed heavily to immature machines which typically experience lower margins as they ramp to that point as shown on chart nine the revenue ramp continues to remain strong with year three revenues of over  per unit per unit manufacturing and installation costs continue to decline with units costing between  and  for  therefore with a per unit capital cost of just over  and increasing revenue trends a redbox unit produces a healthy roic in charts  through  we see redbox rentals progressing quite rapidly resulting in steady market share gains for all dvd rentals you can see the effect of combining and excellent redbox management team with coinstar’s th wall sales force starting  and particularly successes is evident in the markets where we’ve had the longest presence when we made the initial investment in  we thought we might be able to get  share in any given market as is shown in chart  houston and denver two of our oldest markets would suggest our ability to gain more than  share a result much greater than expected we’ve achieved this growth with relatively minimal marketing so you might ask why are so many consumers using redbox consumers tell us price point ease of use convenience selection the return anywhere option and online reservation feature guaranteeing in stock status one of the more startling revelations as shown on chart  is redbox net promoter score which is a major that asks “would you recommend this product or service to your friend” redbox’s net promoter score was a whopping  putting it in elite company with the likes of ebay apple amazon and others a net promoter score of  is considered quite good a net promoter score of  is outstanding in chart  you will note that redbox’ margins have expanded with scale for  the margin will take a slight dip due primarily to a higher than expected installations which will push the mix further towards immature machines we believe this is great for long term profitability however it does put pressure on short term margins additionally we are seeing the resale price of previously viewed videos decline somewhat and the logistics cost for new videos increasing so we are pleased to have announced our intent to acquire the remaining equity in redbox the company has an excellent management team a proven record of execution and when combined with coinstar’s th wall platform sales force it has shown exceptional growth and has great opportunity finally it represents an allocation of capital in a known entity that has already proven itself financially turning to our coin product line as shown in chart  coin revenue for fiscal year  was up  to  million compared to  million a year ago this growth reflects a combination of revenue from new units installed less than  months and same store sales in units greater than  months old although lower than expectations we laid out early in  we were pleased to show positive growth in the current economic environment looking at the two pieces results were driven by continued strength in installations where we set an annual record in  of  net placements this is triple our normal installation of  to  per year and exceeded our beginning of the year expectation of  to  units with the placement of almost  units in the last two years i believe we are well positioned for revenue and ebitda growth in  and  as these units ramp you may recall that after being installed for five years a typical coin unit produces an average of  in annual revenue however in its first year it will only generate about  of this average and in its second year only about  therefore in  the  units placed in  would be expected to generate about  on average with the units placed in  generating about  on average we would expect both classes to improve from there in terms of unit growth after the extraordinary number of installations in  and  we expect to return to our normal installation target of  to  net new units in  moving to same store sales they were  for the full year as shown in chart  this was partially due to the significant increase in installations over the past  months along with the struggling economy while coin exchanging is not in and of itself cyclical or noncyclical we do believe that the economy and weak store traffic patterns due impact our machine usage and to that extent that the machines show some cyclicality however as mentioned on previous calls we have seen a second indicator that seems to have a high correlation in troubled economic times as shown in chart  we have seen an emerging correlation between coin usage and the consumer confidence index recognizing these same store sales trends we are going to take two specific actions in  first we have already started to look at individual locations roic for each coin unit for those locations that do not meet minimum thresholds we will consider redeploying those units to other locations these expenses will be incurred in the first and second quarters of  second we will be increasing our marketing spend the last three quarters of the year and we believe this will drive more consumers to our coin kiosk and will drive incremental profitability finally we remain very excited about the future prospects for the coin business and see significant volume potential for immature machines we see excellent leverage in driving more first time users to our domestic locations and significant installation opportunities in international markets in future years for these reasons we believe we can continue to drive top line and ebitda growth for years to come and that this growth will be more apparent under more normalized economic circumstances now let’s move to money transfer in chart  on a pro forma basis wire transactions were up approximately  for fiscal  from  and the average transaction was roughly  with our acquisition of groupex in january  we now have over  agents in approximately  countries certainly the news in money transfer is mixed with the industry the crucial us to mexico corridor transactions were down  in the fourth quarter which contrasts with coinstar’s us to mexico money transfer business which was up  in the period so while we are certainly affected along with the industry coinstar is advancing its money transfer initiatives albeit at a slower pace these improvements were offset by the planned deemphasis of money orders and home deliver for money transfer in mexico outside the us to mexico and guatemala corridors we saw our  revenue and transactions up approximately  plus as we previously stated we are seeing the emergence of china as a corridor of interest within the fourth quarter we agreed with the china construction bank or ccb one of the their largest banks in china to extend our current money transfer services across all ccb locations in all provinces of china system integration was completed with ccb in the fourth quarter as is shown in the chart on the lower right portion of chart  as transactions and revenue have increased the cost per transaction has declined based upon these trends we continue to believe that driving increased volumes across our fixed costs will get us to profitability part of the decline and the cost per transaction is integrating our two money transfer acquisitions during  we undertook significant integration efforts to combine our compliance and it systems and to reduce our overhead costs we also combined our management teams and moved our back office centers from london and los angeles to lower costs centers in mumbai and guadalajara these efforts will continue this year looking to  it’s our belief that the transitory workforce will continue to be affected by global economic forces people have less discretionary income to transfer and there are fewer jobs for immigrants especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors in europe and the us so while our money transfer business continues to grow and outperform the industry we do not expect it to grow as fast in  as we did in  however in looking at charts  through  we do view the current economic situation as an opportunity to gain market share and position ourselves for the next three years secular trends continue to indicate strong underlying fundamentals for the money transfer business so while the short term trends are not as strong we continue to believe money transfer is an area the retailers will care about on their th wall for a long time for this reason as we gain scale of money transfer business our goal is still to be ebitda positive exiting  moving to epay as reflected in chart  coinstar solid  million in face value a  yearoveryear increase resulted in commissions to coinstar of approximately  million in the us our  transaction volume increases approximately  and we added more than  travel center of america locations  hess locations and just one to stripes a leading convenience store chain in texas where we be installing  locations in the first quarter of  in the uk in  our gift card transaction volume increased  versus  we added over  locations bring total uk epay locations to over  we added new retailers like birthdays bp and superdrive and we added  new cards bringing the total to  cards and over  skus in the uk as we look at the demand side of the business it’s becoming consistently a top draw for retailers and consumers in fact coinstar just won top honors at the recent uk prepaid awards in addition through our epay convenience store relationships we are successfully showing that the th wall category management strategy resonates beyond big box retailers today redbox has agreement with over  c store chains including  valero maverick exxonmobil and cumberland farms to name a few and we have our premium coffee kiosk in pilot in a number of well known convenience store retailers therefore while the economy has certainly slowed our growth in epay in  we saw healthy trends and as we look to  between the uk and the us we expect to continue to add locations cards and retailers and the face value of cards sold to increase another  to  turning to entertainment revenues totaled  million for fiscal year  which is at the lower end of our original range the yearoveryear decrease reflects the deinstallation of machines during  in addition much like the overall trend in  the broader economy negatively affected performance finally with respect to the coffee pilot we continue to be encouraged by the early results throughout the year we rolled out  coffee units to grocery and convenience store customers as expected the convenience store format yielded the highest cup count and highest returns we’ve learned a lot during the pilot and will continue to run this pilot throughout mid  before making a decision relative to a larger scale roll out with that let me turn the call over to brian brian v turner coinstar generated  million in  revenue we generated ebitda of  million for the full year up  our gaap fully diluted fully taxed earnings per share was  with adjusted fully taxed fully diluted earnings per share of  for the quarter coinstar generated  million in revenue we generated ebitda of  million and our gaap fully diluted fully taxed earnings per share was  with adjusted fully diluted fully taxed earnings per share of  looking at charts  and  you’ll see a comparison of both full year and quarterly revenues by product line on a pro forma basis similarly on charts  and  is a comparison of both full year and quarterly ebitda on a pro forma basis as we’ve stated due to the fact that a high percentage of direct and indirect costs are shared among business lines exact ebitda by product line is only an estimate as we look to pro forma full year  ebitda you will note the decline in coin entertainment ebitda this is primarily due to the planned transition in the entertainment product line where we saw a corresponding revenue decline the coin ebitda margins remain consistent with prior years so more than anything it’s a mix issue with respect to epay pro forma ebitda declined primarily as a result of expansion in the uk as you compare epay yearoveryear please recall that the third quarter  includes the telco refund of  million from a business that was losing money when we made our first acquisition in  epay has begun to achieve operational leverage and ebitda margins have now settled in around  in the us we expect the same will happen in the uk after getting through the initial losses that are required to start up the business moving to expenses shown on chart  as a percentage of revenues direct operating expenses for the full year increased to  of revenues this is primarily due to the inclusion of redbox which runs at a higher direct operating cost percentage than our other product lines general and administrative expenses stayed relatively flat as a percentage of revenues at  from  compared to  this is attributable to leverage we are achieving in the dvd product line offset by deleveraging in the entertainment product line depreciation and other for the year totaled  million versus  million in  the increase was primarily due to the consolidation of redbox for  the installation of  coin units and  dvd units over the last four quarters moving to interest expense during the fourth quarter our average interest rate was  or libor plus  this compares to our expected interest rate for the fourth quarter which was approximately  to  in this very volatile debit market i am very pleased that our average interest rate was only  when many borrowers are being hit by much higher borrowing costs within the quarter we continued to see foreign currency gains and losses consistent with past quarters depending on the strengthening or weakening of the dollar we have offsetting currency effects from our uk coin profits foreign currency exposure on our daily money transfer transactions and the uk gift card mall losses and the international money transfer losses for  we recorded a loss of  million through our income statement resulting from foreign currency transactions moving to taxes our effective tax rate for the year was  which was considerably higher than we anticipated at the start of  as we have stated in recent quarters the greater than expected effective rate was due to the interplay of foreign and domestic profits and losses the results of the greater than expected rate was a  in gaap eps please remember that this is the book rate and is not indicative of cash taxes paid during the year actual cash taxes paid during the year totaled just  million significantly less than the  million recorded for book purposes with respect to cap ex for  which is reflected in chart  excluding redbox the company spent  million of which the majority was for new coin units this was higher than anticipated at the beginning of  due to retailer demand for coin units for  redbox’s cap ex was  million which was funded by redbox’s cash flows and some lease financing finally i would like to discuss our debt at the end of december coinstar had  million in revolving debt due in november of  our leverage ratio at december st was just  to  and we’ve been very judicious over the last several years in keeping our debt modest relative to our ebitda this has certainly paid off and with the anticipated closing of today’s redbox equity piece we believe our balance sheet will be even stronger which i will describe in a moment at december   our fully diluted outstanding share count was  million shares and we estimate that our average fully diluted share count for  will range between  and  million shares excluding any buyback activity before i go to our outlook i would like to give you the particulars of today’s acquisition announcement today coinstar entered in to an agreement with getamovie or gam and affiliated mcdonalds corporation coinstar has agreed to acquire gam’s  voting interest in redbox and gam’s right title and interest and  promissory note made by redbox in exchange for a combination of cash and coinstar common stock coinstar will initially pay gam  million in cash and  million in shares of coinstar common stock on the closing date which is expected to be february   in addition coinstar will pay deferred compensation to gam that will be payable in cash andor shares of coinstar common stock at coinstar’s election and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions the agreement with gam also provides that in no event with the shares of coinstar’s common stock issued to gam as consideration exceed  shares at least  of the deferred compensation is payable by july   and the remaining portion is payable by october   the total consideration to be paid to gam is expected to be between approximately  million and  million gam will be entitled to registration rights under the securities act of  as amended with respect to the shares of common stock acquired in connection with the transaction in addition coinstar is expected to purchase the remaining outstanding interest of redbox from minority interest and nonvoting interest holders in redbox consideration will be paid on similar terms as those of the gam purchase agreement the total consideration to be paid in these transactions is expected to be between  million and  million the closing of these transactions are subject to various closing conditions at this time it is coinstar’s intent to pay off the sellers note in cash not in stock and we will decide on the prepayment option over the next few months including the  million paid for our original  of redbox this will bring our total investment in the brand to approximately  million additionally for certain key employees we intend to grant a combination of new performance and time based restricted stock options and retention cash payment as part of their compensation packages going forward pro forma for the transaction our balance sheet will be stronger in fact we expect our leverage ratio to improve from the current  to  to  to  immediately after this transaction closes concurrent with today’s transaction we also amended our credit facility key terms include pledging the redbox assets as collateral for the credit facility which allows us to borrow against the combined ebitda of coinstar and redbox additionally as shown in chart  the bank syndicate increased the capital lease and cap ex baskets in return coinstar paid an amendment fee and bank syndicate plus adjusted the interest rate pricing grid the amendment along with our forecasted cash flows enables us via available credit facility to pay off the remaining transaction value in cash not in stock should we choose to do so before the next earnings call coinstar will review the purchase accounting for this transaction under the newly amended accounting standard for business combination all deal costs related to the transaction will be expensed within the first quarter of  in addition the transaction may give rise to greater intangible assets and the associated amortization of intangible assets taking these items in to consideration coinstar believes that the transaction will be accretive for  now on to full year guidance which represents an upward revision starting with the top line we’re estimating that coinstar’s revenue will be between  and  billion representing a  increase at the midpoint which is reflected in chart  this accelerates our revenue growth from what we had previously estimated which was to be at a billion run rate beginning in mid  the revenue range is based upon certain assumptions including coin revenues ranging from  to  million driven by  to  net new coin units and a same store sales estimate of a  to a  we expect coin ebtida margins to remain consistent with  levels with respect specifically to dvd we are looking to install  to  new units in  along with the existing units this will produce a revenue range of between  million and  million with ebitda margins between  and  our entertainment revenue range is based upon certain assumptions including stagnant retail traffic in most locations in this segment we expect revenue of between  million and  million moving to epay we expect  revenues inclusive of cmt to be between  and  million the economy is affecting money transfer throughout the world and the latin america corridor is one of the hardest hit fortunately the business model of money transfer and prepaid card business allows for significantly leverage on the upside as well so when the economy turns we are confident that our market share gains will translate disproportionally to the bottom lines therefore we expect consolidated ebitda for coinstar to grow between  and  in  to between  and  million with respect to taxes we anticipate an effective tax rate for  of between  and  finally with respect to cap ex for  looking to chart  we expect to spend in aggregate  million to  million our  cap ex includes approximately  million in new coin machines approximately  million in new equipment for epay including cmt and approximately  million on new dvd kiosks turning to the first quarter of  based on current trends we expect first quarter of roughly  million to  million with gaap earnings per fully taxed fully diluted share in the range of  to  in the first quarter several factors will affect gaap eps including the implementation of fas r which will require expensing of past capitalized and currently incurred acquisition costs of approximately  to  million the implementation of fas  and fas  and potentially purchase accounting effects of the acquisition of the remaining equity of redbox in addition we are making certain investments in the first quarter in the infrastructure of coinstar especially in the area of it hr and business intelligence to better serve our retailers these investments which total approximately  million are primarily in the first half of  we are also further integrating our money transfer acquisitions in the first quarter of  this will include incurring additional expense to optimize headcount restructure corridors and closing offices to consolidate in lower cost countries these money transfer moves will increase expenses by approximately  million in the first quarter however will ultimately create a lower cost structure i’ll now turn the call back to paul for closing remarks paul d davis we are fortunate to have a diverse product portfolio a diverse customer base the financial and technological resources to manage large networks for thousands of retail stores and importantly we have a unique business model that allows us to add value to our retailers every day giving us the opportunity to introduce new products and services over time as we’ve said before due to declining foot traffic and softening sales we’re seeing retailers increasingly op for professionally delivered services in fewer vendors we believe they prefer to outsource this function to a group that brings in an overall category management strategy to the table for this reason smaller one product or one service providers are often times at a disadvantage unable to get credit and unable to invest in technology in our multiple network products allinall we see  and  as a significant opportunity for coinstar to gain market share and separate ourselves from the competition we believe the platform we’ve created is ideal for that we evolved in to the th wall layer we are aligned with leading retailers including walmart tessco walgreens mcdonalds kroger inaudible supervalue and many others we continue to nurture these relationships and establish new ones that we believe are unmatched by our competitors if you look at it from the retailers perspective coinstar pays for all the cap ex takes care of all the labor and servicing and bears all the theft risk we monetize underutilized space and deliver some of the higher profit per square foot anywhere in the store low capital costs and high returns in this economy that value proposition speaks volumes to the retailer finally i’m proud to be accelerating our outlook for revenue and ebitda with that we’ll open up the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from john kraft – d a davidson  co john kraft – d a davidson  co the one thing that you did not talk about at all was the lawsuit between you and universal is there anything new there that we could hear about brian v turner there’s really not a lot new at this point we’ve continued to do the work arounds that we’ve talked about in the past it hasn’t really been a major disruption at all to our business so not much new to really report john kraft – d a davidson  co is the decision on mcdonalds’ part to actually sell to you rather than go with the ipo is it related at all to the lawsuit david w cole i think for that you’d have to ask mcdonalds john kraft – d a davidson  co is it fair to at last blame some of the ebitda reduction in  at least relative to kind of some of your targets due to some of the higher logistical costs that you talked about with handling the universal dvds david w cole yes we talked about that before there will be greater logistic cost in connection with obtaining universal titles so yes that is part of it john kraft – d a davidson  co as you kind of foresee the potential scenarios of how this may pan out is it possible that you’ll be sticking with kind of the status quo for several quarters or even years paul d davis what do you mean by status quo john kraft – d a davidson  co sort of working around the studios and packaging them in your jewel cases yourselves david w cole i hope that we successfully resolve this with universal you just never know with these things but often civil suits take years and years to resolve and we’ll just have to see john kraft – d a davidson  co paul at the very beginning of your comments you mentioned that you’re looking around and reviewing the business lines have you taken any thought to potentially making divestitures paul d davis i don’t think i’m there yet john we’re just doing as you would expect a deep dive on each one of our verticals and looking at the role it plays in the portfolio i’ve always believed a business needs to stand on its own two feet but never to the point that we’d make short term decisions because a lot of our businesses when we’re in the investment mode it takes a while for them to really start turning to profitability so we’re taking all that in to consideration we’re doing the work as we speak john kraft – d a davidson  co then as far as the redbox they’ve certainly proved themselves as a great management team i assume you’re going to be taking a somewhat of a hands off approach it sounds like you want to let them kind of be and leave their facilities in illinois alone david w cole the team there is one of the best teams we’ve ever seen we’re very very proud to be working with them they’ve had great leadership and the continue to lever yearoveryear we’ve always worked with them we have our sales organization at the coinstar side has been the sales agent for the past three years so we’ll continue that relationship we’ll look as we move down the path together but it’s a great team john kraft – d a davidson  co just the last question on redbox i think you’ve talked in the past about some seasonality will you just i guess remind me of the seasonal nature there’s some certain lulls and when good or new releases are released brian v turner i think if you look at chart  that we provide you see certain seasonality and what you see there is some peaks in july and then another peak around sort of thanksgiving to december what this matches is the release from the studios of the dvds to dvds so you have your theatrical releases and then you have a time lag and then they hit dvds so where you see those blockbusters coming out where again the studios tend to group them in two groups you will see that sort of junejuly and then the novemberdecember type grouping john kraft – d a davidson  co just one more for you brian as far as the tax rate as you look out in the longer term and work through i guess some of these international losses do you see it moving to sort of more normal ranges that you’ve had soon brian v turner absolutely i think if you were to normalize this all out we’d be somewhere in the  to  range eventually we’ll get back there book taxes are always interesting i worry frankly more about the cash taxes we’re paying so at the end of the day of course we want to pay our fair share but minimize our cash taxes operator your next question comes from bob evans – craighallum capital group bob evans – craighallum capital group first a few questions the  to  million that you had mentioned brian on the r charge is that part of the guidance that you gave brian v turner yes we gave gaap eps guidance that includes this  to  million bob evans – craighallum capital group and the ebitda guidance includes that as well brian v turner yes bob evans – craighallum capital group if you were to quantify kind of investments and accounting charges how much – i’m just trying to get a sense of kind of nonrecurring if you will items that are part of that ebitda guidance brian v turner there’s several things the  to  million which is both the current redbox thing that we intend to finish and then past ones so we had a couple of things that were in process which under the new accounting standards you can no longer capitalize they have to be expensed so there’s a little cumulative one there so first the  to  if you look at the first half of the year the  million that we’re investing in infrastructure such as it hr business intelligence those are things that as paul has come on he’s identified some things that he would like or as we’ve talked to our retailers there’s things we’d do there we’ve just decided to invest in those in the first half of the year so i look at those as really nonrecurring then lastly money transfers paul talked about in his part and then i talked about it in my part we’re going to spend about  million optimizing our money transfer headquarters such things as moving from london and los angeles which are very high cost places to do business more to mumbai guadalajara lower cost we pay costs now so that we can get the lower cost structure for the long term that will add almost  million primarily to q so you total all that up and just in q there’s easily  to  million of nonrecurring charges bob evans – craighallum capital group and the money transfer doesn’t really hit q to any large extent brian v turner of the  million it all depends on timing sometimes you take your best guess but i would say the majority of that million is going to hit in q some of it will hit in q bob evans – craighallum capital group can you give us any sense of potential cost savings from the money transfer and it infrastructure investments brian v turner if i look at money transfer it will easily save that amount plus  to  per year each year as we go along a lot of those benefits you won’t see till ’ or ’ but it something as we look at the long term it’s worth investing now for the long term bob evans – craighallum capital group as it relates to redbox and the service infrastructure is there any opportunities to integrate what you have existing with coinstar and redbox david w cole that’s a good question we often times are asked that and i don’t think so we would explore that but it’s not on our radar screen right now it’s not an obvious opportunity because what’s required inside the stores the service frequency are quite a bit different so it’s not there right yet bob evans – craighallum capital group could you give us a little more insight given the magnitude of your revenue increase ’ versus ’ given your ebitda increase the percentages are certainly down in terms of ebitda margin percent ’ versus ’ give us a sense of how much of that is conservatism on your part versus something that maybe i’m not fully seeing brian v turner no we always try to guide to where we think we’ll end up we don’t intentionally try to be overly conservative or overly optimistic with that i think you know we had talked about before if we install  to  redbox units where we would clearly the market demand is much greater than that and so we upped our guidance to  to  that puts quite a bit of pressure in ebitda so you’re seeing that reflected in the ebitda growth rate with that said in this economy seeing  to  ebitda growth boy i think we’re happy with that in this economy bob evans – craighallum capital group is it fair to say given more scale and maturity of the machines that  ebitda target that we’ve seen in the past can occur again in the future brian v turner sure as you look at things like that you saw that peak through in q and q of ’ because there were lower install quarters in q of ’ then as we started to install aggressively again in the mid part of the year the ebitda margins came down because it’s a blended if you look to next year let’s say we put out the midpoint between  and  say  units we’ve got  out between redbox and dvdxpress now that’s another  on top of what we’ve got that’s quite a bit of immature machines affecting your ebitda margin bob evans – craighallum capital group i’m wondering from a business model standpoint basically you’re saying the business model that’s been there from a margin standpoint remains intact it’s just a function of you’ve got more and more immature machines out there brian v turner absolutely we believe the business model for redbox coin and our other businesses are as vibrant as ever bob evans – craighallum capital group finally depreciation and amortization i know you’ve got a lot of data out there and maybe i missed it what should we look at for ’ as an all in kind of range for da brian v turner that’s a good question do you have another question while i look that one up let me look that up as we go to the next question operator your next question comes from steven rees – jp morgan steven rees – jp morgan just given the counter cyclical nature of the dvd business can you just comment on how the same unit trends trended throughout maybe the second half of this year when it seems like retail foot traffic decelerated throughout the year just comment on that please paul d davis i think i’m going to ask gregg kaplan who’s on the phone with us gregg’s the ceo of redbox gregg do you want to answer gregg kaplan over the course of the year we generally saw same store sales remain relatively constant in this sort of  range sometimes a little bit higher sometimes a little bit lower that’s often affected by installations as brian was talking about before as we install a lot of machines and machines are sort of becoming their th month that has impact but we’re seeing pretty consistent same store sales growth in that  range steven rees – jp morgan then just on the decision to increase the installs to  to  can you just sort of talk about what’s driving that are there any major new retailers that you’re going with or is it just more of working with your existing partners david w cole when we’ve gone out there and looked at the pull in the marketplace there’s a pretty significant demand so upping it from kind of a run rate of  up to  the number could have actually been a lot bigger than that but just in terms of trying to balance it out and how much capital we can afford to spend and trying to have good predictable returns we opted for the  target but candidly it could have been a much bigger number steven rees – jp morgan then as i just think about the overall dvd base of about  how much overlap is there today with your other product suites i mean how many of those  are colocated with a coin machine or something else brian v turner we’re seeing more and more overlap and so if you look at – the exact number i don’t have right at my fingertip but i would say the majority have some overlap now as you see from our recent announcement we’re going in to new channels so as redbox goes in to let’s say the commune store channels we won’t have quite as much overlap so that number is going to jump up and down but we see that as an opportunity that will actually open up more cross sell opportunity for our other product lines the desire is to have the majority of the locations overlap between redbox and some other product line or vice versa some other product line and redbox david w cole where the coin line is deepest in its penetration the super market channel that’s also the case where our deepest penetration is with dvd brian is right as we’re broadening the footprint and going in to convenience stores you’ll start to see more diversity there steven rees – jp morgan as i think about the coin deceleration in same store sales is there anything in particular with regards to the type of retailer or geography that you saw change in the fourth quarter or is perhaps the cannibalization impact rising or higher than you originally thought david w cole cannibalization is always going to be a small percentage of the issue really the major issue to point to is the economy and what’s happening with kind of foot traffic and that direct correlation with consumer confidence index what’s good here is as we’ve expanded especially we’ve talked about walmart expansion and in the mass merchant channel and their superstores over the last year and in to this year that’s where a lot of the traffic is moving to so in particular where you get in to high penetration where there’s really tight overlap you might start seeing the same store sales dip a bit but mostly it’s foot traffic as a result of the economy paul d davis one of the things we saw is the fed just realized what the saw for coin shift by the fed now this is not total in circulation it’s dropping less but just new coin shipped dropped  in  that just came out from the us mint that’s a reflection of the economy now certainly the overall that’s in the economy dropped much more minor than that but we’re seeing coin in the overall economy as well as just general purchases in the overall economy they’re down last we saw somewhere between  and  so that certainly affects the coin people are generating steven rees – jp morgan at this point would you expect that same store sales trend to decelerate further or will a lower install plan help that paul d davis we always said the piece of that would be q ’ now we don’t know exactly it’s the interplay of the economy to the installs but as we looked at the installs we put in last year as they’re moving up the ramp curve as they lap  months and one day our theory has always been and this has been consistent for about five quarters that the peak would be a q  of that affect and then it starts to trend the other way now we’ll have to see where the economy goes and let’s all hope the economy gets better david w cole we’ve modeled that out and i think the range we’ve talked about is in safe grounds just given the kind of new machine ramp and the sort of historical predictive levels brian v turner before we go to the next question bob back to your question da for  was roughly  million as we look to ’ we see it landing somewhere between  million and  million hopefully that answers your question operator your next question comes from nate brochmann – william blair  company nate brochmann – william blair  company i wanted to talk a little bit about where we stand with walmart i know that’s largely over in terms of the installs and deinstalls and how you see some of the initial performance there and maybe what’s left in that area david w cole we will have completed coin in to this year that we’re just through brian v turner in coin we still have about  more to go and we expect those to finish by q and so that’s on track then redbox i don’t have quite the number in front of me but we have more to go on redbox but we expect to finish those in ’ right on schedule so everything is right on schedule for walmart as we look at the ramp curves for walmart they’re doing as we expected which is good in the current economics we’re actually quite pleased with both the timing of the roll out and how the ramps are nate brochmann – william blair  company paul this is another strategy question but given where we are in the economy and given kind of digesting the opportunity with redbox this year how do you think about the kind of foreign strategy with each of the different units maybe today and also three years down the road paul d davis you’re asking by line of business the expansion outside of sort of domestic nate brochmann – william blair  company correct paul d davis i think for sure there’s a big opportunity in coin we have been just so busy on executing primarily in the uk and the us we did expand in to canada and in to ireland and those expansions have gone very well the teams they have done a deep dive and have a great understanding of what would be some likely next countries if we were to do that it gets down to capital allocations and just priorities so within the next three years i suspect you’ll see us start to expand broader than where we are today we are expanding as you know with our epay business what we did a year and a half ago and started in the uk gift card mall and based on early results i mean you saw were up  on that business versus a year ago and we had the first mover advantage there so that’s proven to be very beneficial if i were to project forward and say could you take the success of what we’re doing in the uk and expand that across the continent the answer is absolutely but we’re going to be really prudent and diligent on that roll out to make sure that this is something that’s really got legs early results we’re getting great top line and we have a good line of sight on what it’s going to take on a transaction basis to make that ebitda positive money transfer speaks for itself that is the business it’s in relative to dvd gregg if i don’t get this right chime in but we have so much opportunity right in our own backyard in the states that that’s really where we’re focused right now i know that gregg and his team they’ve scoped out kind of rest of the world and there are some big opportunities but it just gets down to pace gregg kaplan i would agree with that we get what feels like weekly invitations to try and take this to other countries which we investigate but we’ve continued to say that our best opportunity is to just continue going after the us and stay focused there but we’ll continue to look at the international opportunities which may be very promising nate brochmann – william blair  company kind of in conjunction with that not to give away any competitive type of information but how do you allocate as you decide the number of installs you’d like to target for say ’ and i’m sure that there’s a lot of convenience stores and a lot of other chains that i know there’s a lot of demand for the dvd product how do you kind of allocate where those go and prioritize that paul d davis this gets in to the overall allocation strategy so we’ve always said we never want to put all our eggs in one basket and so we try to run a diversified portfolio of ideas if you look at just the top level allocation and you can see this in our cap ex for next year we’ve got some investment in coin investment in dvd but investment in other lines of business as well as new product ideas we’ve always got a couple of things back in the lab that goes to any individual product line for coin for example we’re going in to banks we’re going in to more grocery we’re going in to mass merchants for redbox we want to run a diversified strategy of grocery mass merchant qsr or quick service restaurants and convenience stores so as we look at this certainly we’re looking at the ramp curves of individual units within a channel but we’re also trying to run a portfolio approach so we don’t have all our eggs in one basket operator your next question comes from bob evans – craighallum capital group bob evans – craighallum capital group first just to clarify on the da you had give the  to  does that include amortization of intangibles brian v turner yes by the way that includes amortization of intangibles that we know of we still have to do the work around redbox and we won’t know the final answer to that over the next conference call bob evans – craighallum capital group so it could be a bit higher then brian v turner it will be i just don’t know exactly bob evans – craighallum capital group then i think redbox same store sales i think you said  for the year do you happen to have q same store sales gregg kaplan i’m doing a little bit of calculation here i can get you an approximate number in the mid s bob evans – craighallum capital group i know you broke out revenue by segment for ’ i don’t know if i see ebitda by segment i’m just wondering if money transfer if can give us some general idea in terms of how you view money transfer from an ebitda standpoint in ’ brian v turner i think it’s very consistent with what we’ve been saying in the past we do expect money transfer to be ebitda negative for ’ we expect it to exit  being ebitda positive so our goals have not changed there i don’t have the exact percentage in front of me but if we look at dollars somewhere between  and  million of ebitda losses for next year i think that will largely depend on the money transfer flow and there are quite a bit of opinions about this listening to the western union conference call listening to the world bank seeing our own growth is going against the industry the industry is struggling more we are growing there i’m giving you a wide range because it is not exactly clearly what immigration patterns will be for all of ’ bob evans – craighallum capital group by the end of ’ do you think you’re closer to breakeven on money transfer on a quarterly basis brian v turner i’d like to say yes but this one i am going to be conservative because you asked that earlier in the call we’re looking at the construction industry and the manufacturing industries in europe and united states we’re not seeing a lot of strength there that is what employees a lot of first generation legal immigrants so with the weakness there it is going to slow our progression with money transfer so no i don’t think we’ll be at breakeven exiting ’ i think it just pushes it off a year to  bob evans – craighallum capital group final question and maybe it’s more appropriate for gregg bluray and redbox i know you’re doing some testing there can you give us a sense of how that’s going and is there a potential for a potential higher price gregg kaplan sure we are testing bluray and so far have good results clearly there’s bluray adoption is still in its early stages so we continue to test and we expect bluray results to continue to get better in terms of pricing we will test at different price levels with bluray and haven’t made a decision yet as to ultimately what the price will be we need to see what the results come out at operator at this time there are no further question in the queue david w cole thank you everyone we do appreciate everyone’s support and
