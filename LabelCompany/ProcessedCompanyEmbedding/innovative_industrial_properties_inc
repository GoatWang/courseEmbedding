investors there remains a quandary how do you find a way to get in on the ground floor of this new growth industrywhile wealthy silicon valley investors have been seeking out cannibis startups this year the options are few and far between for public investors who often lack the high net worth needed to access the private markets that may begin changing this week as the first cannabis company

mattel plans to win over ipadobsessed kidsafter decades of life as a black market staple cannabis has become a nascent industry poised for rapid growth california massachusetts nevada and maine this

report by arcview market research and new frontier data sales are projected to grow to  billion this year and to  billion by  when medical pot will make up less than half the total “legalization of cannabis is one of greatest business opportunities of our time and it’s still early enough to see huge growth” said arcview ceo troy dayton a separate report from cowen  co projects a  billion market in  yearsgetting in on the ground floor of the cannabis industry hasnt been easy nasdaq lists a handful of biotech companies that develop cannabinoid medicines arena pharmaceuticals for example produces a therapy treating chronic pain while gw pharmaceuticals has a cannabisbased drug to treat epilepsy but these companies wont benefit from the growth of the retail marijuana marketthere are also several dozen potthemed companies trading over the counter — that is outside formal exchanges like the nyse or nasdaq these include companies that sell smoking devices produce medical marijuana or do lab testing many have colorful names like pineapple express bud genius and namaste technologies the problem the otc markets are high risk illiquid and volatile at best a wild west of fraud and manipulation at worst although its listing on the nyse innovative industrial properties carries its own share of risk the san diego company has no revenue to date but it plans on buying a acre property in new yorks hudson valley shortly after the ipo for  million and its working to spend another  million on several other properties after that most of its revenue will come from rents to licensed medical marijuana startupsperhaps more importantly iips ipo will be watched as an interesting test case for other cannabis companies that want to list on public exchanges in may nasdaq denied an ipo bid by a marijuanacentric social network massroots citing federal laws that prohibit the drugs usebecause marijuana remains classified as a schedule i drug some banks and financial institutions have been reluctant to finance the fledgling industry that may worsen under a trump administration which could overrule state laws that have already legalized marijuana the incoming us attorney general has called cannabis “a very real danger” and said “good people dont smoke marijuana”indeed there are already signs that iips trailblazing offering may be hitting speed bumps the company filed for its ipo in october and initially planned to raise  million by going public before thanksgiving after the offering was delayed iip refiled monday for a more modest  million offering on tuesday it filed yet again for an  million offeringstartups that pioneer new industries typically offer a shot at big returns with the tradeoff of high risk cannabis startups are no different except the regulatory concerns could make them even riskier still many investors practicing the old dictum “invest in what you know” might be eager to have an opportunity to invest in a business they patronize
