fixedincome fund strategic bond fund news provided by american funds apr    et share this article los angeles april   prnewswire  capital group one of the worlds leading investment management firms announced today that it has launched its new fixedincome fund american funds strategic bond fundsm sbf sbf takes a distinctive approach to multisector investing and will be benchmarked against the barclays us aggregate index the funds strategy can be considered a flexible coreplus strategy where investors have the potential to benefit from greater flexibility in changing interest rate environments at the same time the strategy will remain focused on achieving the funds total return objective and providing diversification to the equity market the fund will invest at least  of its assets in bonds and other debt securities we have been monitoring the multisector bond category for many years and have been managing this fund strategy internally since july  so that we could feel certain of its potential to meet our investors objectives said mike gitlin head of fixed income at capital group the fund will seek to generate returns through multiple sources including interest rate management and yield curve positioning while the fund will have broad flexibility to invest in credit significant reliance on credit especially exposure from high yield securities is less likely to be a characteristic of sbf capital group believes that this approach can help the fund maintain low to negative correlation to the equity markets thereby providing important portfolio diversification benefits many investment offerings in the nontraditional bond universe are highly correlated with the equity market due to significant high yield exposure noted gitlin while credit will play a role in our strategic bond fund strategy there is a keen focus on the value we can add to clients through a rates perspective as opposed to an overreliance on subinvestment grade credit we believe this is a key differentiator of strategic bond fund portfolio managers david hoag ritchie tuazon and damien mccann will manage the fund as a team using the research and risk management capabilities of capital groups fixedincome group and broader organization capital group is committed to offering our clients fixedincome strategies to meet their evolving investment needs added gitlin we are very excited to offer our strategic bond fund because it is another vehicle to help our clients better balance their portfolios and ultimately achieve their goals capital group now has  bond funds available to investors  about capital group since  capital group has been singularly focused on delivering superior results for longterm investors using highconviction portfolios rigorous research and individual accountability today capital group manages more than us  trillion in longterm equity and fixedincome assets for millions of individual and institutional investors around the world as of december
