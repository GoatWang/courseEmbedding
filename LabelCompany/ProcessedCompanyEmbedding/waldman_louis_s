taking a job in a cardboard box factory waldman graduated from high school in the spring of  and owing to a lack of funds for college enrolled in the cooper union to study engineering that fall waldman was a shocked member of the crowd on the street that witnessed the catastrophic triangle waist company fire of  an event which clearly always remained with him and served as one of the landmarks of his life waldman described the grim scene in his  memoirs one saturday afternoon in march of that year — march  to be precise — i was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old astor library it was a raw unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed i was deeply engrossed in my book when i became aware of fire engines racing past the building by this time i was sufficiently americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines along with several others in the library i ran out to see what was happening and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire a few blocks away the asch building at the corner of washington place and greene street was ablaze when we arrived at the scene the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze the eighth ninth and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames word had spread through the east side by some magic of terror that the plant of the triangle waist company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped horrified and helpless the crowds — i among them — looked up at the burning building saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows pause for a terrified moment and then leap to the pavement below to land as mangled bloody pulp this went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and screaming with clothing and hair ablaze plunged like a living torch to the street life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies the emotions of the crowd were indescribable women were hysterical scores fainted men wept as in paroxysms of frenzy they hurled themselves against the police lines  packed into a tight space and locked away from means of escape  workers from the buildings th floor died that day in one of the greatest tragedies in new york citys history at a memorial meeting held at cooper union in the aftermath of the fire waldman saw and heard socialist leader morris hillquit speak for the first time an event which inspired waldman to engage in a veritable orgy of reading on socialism and thereby won the young man over to the socialist cause waldman graduated from cooper union in june  with a degree in engineering and worked as a construction engineer during the day while following his ambition to become a lawyer by attending law school in the evenings he was admitted to the new york state bar in  and worked thereafter as counsel for the amalgamated clothing workers of america for the new york central trades and labor council and for various other unions in the building and garment trades socialist in the new york assemblyedit louis waldman c  in  the young engineer louis waldman was approached at a meeting of his socialist party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the new york state assembly although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning the party official approaching him smiled and replied campaigning who said anything about campaigning we just want someone to run for office if you get more than seven hundred votes well be lucky the real campaigns this year will be for meyer london and morris hillquit and thus was born a socialist party politician waldman did actually campaign however mounting the platform to give public speeches at which he gradually improved waldman performed well in the  election tripling the socialist tally while losing to his democratic opponent by a few hundred votes in the fall of  with america embroiled in the european conflict and a section of the american electorate radicalized by the turn towards war by the democratic administration of woodrow wilson waldman ran for the assembly again as a socialist this time winning election waldman was a member of the state assembly new york co th d sitting in the st new york state legislature one of  socialists elected to the assembly of  the best electoral performance that the organization would ever achieve in november  waldman met with defeat but he ran again for state assembly in  against a fusion candidate of the democratic and republican parties and emerged victorious along with four other socialist party comrades august claessens samuel orr charles solomon and samuel a dewitt the five socialist assemblymen were suspended on the first day of the new legislative session by the republicandominated body and their expulsion trial before the judiciary committee of the assembly and subsequent court fight became a cause celebre of the red scare they were expelled on april  all five were reelected at a special election on september  and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on september  the next day dewitt and orr were permitted to take their seats but claessens solomon and waldman were expelled again protesting against the reexpulsion of their comrades dewitt and orr resigned their seats in  he ran on the socialist ticket for new york attorney general waldman was elected chairman of the socialist party of new york state in  a position which he retained through the first half of the s he also stood as the sp candidate for governor of new york in   and  polling over  votes in each of these races along with morris hillquit james oneal and algernon lee waldman was recognized as a leader of the sps old guard faction which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the american federation of labor and pursuance of gradual ameliorative reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation this perspective brought waldman and the old guard into opposition of the largely youth based militant faction in the party who favored reconciliation with the communist party usa in keeping with the united front policy of the comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalisms collapse factional leader in the sedit during the first half of the s waldman was one of the leading figures of the socalled old guard of the socialist party — an organized faction based in new york city which sought to continue the partys traditional orientation towards electoral politics and close cooperation with the trade union movement the old guard organized itself in opposition to a socalled militant faction which emerged in  and  consisting of younger and more radical members who sought a turn towards direct action and a program endorsing revolutionary socialism although both of these main factions considered themselves orthodox marxists the social democratic old guard considered their militant opponents to be adventurists with a deluded sense of enthusiasm for the soviet union and the world communist movement while the militants considered the old guard to be dyedinthewood reformists unwilling to challenge antidemocratic behavior in the union movement personal and personnel issues entered into play the militants sought to replace socialist party national chairman morris hillquit the best known and most widely respected of the old guard leaders as an impediment to the future growth of the party the old guard similarly sought the removal of the partys national executive secretary clarence senior a protégé of the charismatic spokesman for the radical wing of the party former presidential candidate norman thomas an outspoken pacifist who had made common cause with the organized militant group in an effort to build the spa into a mass movement the critical moment in the struggle between the two main factions came in june  at the socialist partys national convention in detroit michigan there the assembled delegates took up debate of an aggressively antimilitarist declaration of principles for the party written by thomas ally devere allen louis waldman was one of the key spokesmen for the old guard in the debate over this document at the detroit convention waldman took issue with the clause of the proposed declaration of principles which called for massed war resistance by the party in the face of a new war comrades what does that phrase mean massed war resistance is one of the clauses which constituted the basis of indictment of thousands of people during the last war massed war resistance is one of those provocative phrases which is capable of all kinds of construction what does a political party dedicated to lawful and peaceful struggle mean when it declares itself dedicated to the use of massed war resistance if it does not mean extralegal means for myself comrades it is inconceivable to me that i can remain a social democrat and become bound by this declaration i make my appeal to you comrades if we have to adjourn without a declaration i would a thousand times rather do that than commit the socialist party to an anarchistic illegal and communistic doctrine following the conclusion of debate the declaration of principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to the membership of the party for ratification by referendum vote the old guard minority issued a formal statement on the matter calling the declaration of principles inadequate and confused and a step towards turning the spa into an underground organization the old guard statement continued existing democracy incomplete though it be is immensely valuable to the workers through whose struggles it has been won let communists and fascists call it bogus our duty is to defend and perfect it the pledge to support any comrade coming into conflict with the law by any antiwar activity invites fanatics and provocators sic to join the party and involve it in responsibility for acts inconsistent with socialist prinicples it is also an incitement to unlawful acts such incitement is itself a crime for which courts could hold every party member liable the membership of the party was encouraged to defeat proposed new declaration of principles in favor of retention of the existing  declaration the  declaration of principles was ratified by the party membership nonetheless the factional war within the socialist party continued unabated for more than a year more with the old guard faction ultimately exiting the party en masse to form the social democratic federation sdf at the time of the partys may  convention in cleveland social democratic federation yearsedit louis waldman as he appeared at the time of publication of his first memoir in  waldman continued to play a leading role in the new sdf organization an organizational meeting was held of the new group in early july at which waldman sought to endorse franklin delano roosevelt for president of the united states in lieu of the socialist nominee norman thomas the gathering found itself split on the issue however and no endorsement was forthcoming waldmans foes such as new york socialist party executive secretary jack altman and socialist candidate for governor harry w laidler were quick to attack waldman charging him with a betrayal of socialist principles in attempting to divert  socialist votes to the roosevelt column many sdf members became involved in the american labor party when it was formed in  supporting the faction led by david dubinsky waldman however resigned from the alp in  feeling it had been taken over by a procommunist faction led by sidney hillman it was not for another four years until dubinsky and his supporters reached the same conclusion and bolted to form the liberal party after resigning from the alp waldman had virtually no political involvements and devoted himself to his law practice becoming one of the most distinguished labor lawyers in the nation during this period he represented walter krivitsky among others he was also active in the new york state bar association and served over the years on numerous state commissions representing unions as varied as the amalgamated clothing workers of america and the international longshoremens association waldman continued his practice right up to his death perspective of civil rights movementedit like many liberals of his time waldman expressed sympathy for the endeavors of civil rights activists but did not agree with their tactic of breaking the law in an article published by the new york state bar journal in  he expressed his worries he begins by assuring his readers that he espoused and still espouses the cause of civil rights for all people and then argues “those who assert rights under the constitution and the laws made thereunder must abide by that constitution and the law if that constitution is to survive they cannot pick and choose they cannot say they will abide by those laws which they think are just and refuse to abide by those laws which they think are unjust the country therefore cannot accept dr king’s doctrine that he and his followers will pick and choose knowing that it is illegal to do so i say such a doctrine is not only illegal and for that reason alone should be abandoned but that it is also immoral destructive of the principles of democratic government and a danger to the very civil rights dr king seeks to promote in such a way waldman asserted defying the law is on its face generally a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases especially if the legal system is basically decent therefore in order to meet this objection those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law answering waldmans objections king often used such a particular argument the evils being opposed were so serious so numerous and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort although the means were regrettable the end justified the means death and legacyedit

helped found now vladeck waldman elias and engelhardt continues to exist as one of the leadingcitation needed labor law firms in new york labor lawyeredit in  louis waldman published his first autobiography labor lawyer in which he laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career among other things waldman became very critical of the new deal considering it to be overly accommodating to the communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies somewhat echoing the critique of the old right he was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during world war ii labor lawyer also represents an important primary source for the history of the socialist party in the years following the death of eugene victor debs it is worthy of note that many of the figures he denounces as dangerous procommunists in his book such as reinhold niebuhr and andrew biemiller would later become pillars of anticommunist liberals of the postwar years while waldman himself was mostly apolitical after the war this perspective clearly informed younger old guard supporters such as morrie ryskind and ralph de toledano who moved to the right from the anticommunist left time possibly whittaker chambers reviewed the book saying waldmans experiences in the years that followed were part of the tumultuous coming of age of us social consciousness labor lawyer waldmans autobiography is an esoteric jumble above all it is an old socialists insistent desperate warning against communism as the no  despoiler of the democratic ideal waldman believes that the strength of communism in the us is now reaching a new peak in the cios political action committee time july   the catchall for the political activities of unions dominated by communists militant socialists and others willing to cooperate with them he concludes flatly unless the new deal casts out the seeds of leftwing totalitarianism which it fosters

thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a doortodoor peddler of ribbon before taking a job in a cardboard box factory waldman graduated from high school in the spring of  and owing to a lack of funds for college enrolled in the cooper union to study engineering that fall waldman was a shocked member of the crowd on the street that witnessed the catastrophic triangle waist company fire of  an event which clearly always remained with him and served as one of the landmarks of his life waldman described the grim scene in his  memoirs one saturday afternoon in march of that year — march  to be precise — i was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old astor library it was a raw unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed i was deeply engrossed in my book when i became aware of fire engines racing past the building by this time i was sufficiently americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines along with several others in the library i ran out to see what was happening and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire a few blocks away the asch building at the corner of washington place and greene street was ablaze when we arrived at the scene the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze the eighth ninth and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames word had spread through the east side by some magic of terror that the plant of the triangle waist company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped horrified and helpless the crowds — i among them — looked up at the burning building saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows pause for a terrified moment and then leap to the pavement below to land as mangled bloody pulp this went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and screaming with clothing and hair ablaze plunged like a living torch to the street life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies the emotions of the crowd were indescribable women were hysterical scores fainted men wept as in paroxysms of frenzy they hurled themselves against the police lines  packed into a tight space and locked away from means of escape  workers from the buildings th floor died that day in one of the greatest tragedies in new york citys history at a memorial meeting held at cooper union in the aftermath of the fire waldman saw and heard socialist leader morris hillquit speak for the first time an event which inspired waldman to engage in a veritable orgy of reading on socialism and thereby won the young man over to the socialist cause waldman graduated from cooper union in june  with a degree in engineering and worked as a construction engineer during the day while following his ambition to become a lawyer by attending law school in the evenings he was admitted to the new york state bar in  and worked thereafter as counsel for the amalgamated clothing workers of america for the new york central trades and labor council and for various other unions in the building and garment trades socialist in the new york assemblyedit louis waldman c  in  the young engineer louis waldman was approached at a meeting of his socialist party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the new york state assembly although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning the party official approaching him smiled and replied campaigning who said anything about campaigning we just want someone to run for office if you get more than seven hundred votes well be lucky the real campaigns this year will be for meyer london and morris hillquit and thus was born a socialist party politician waldman did actually campaign however mounting the platform to give public speeches at which he gradually improved waldman performed well in the  election tripling the socialist tally while losing to his democratic opponent by a few hundred votes in the fall of  with america embroiled in the european conflict and a section of the american electorate radicalized by the turn towards war by the democratic administration of woodrow wilson waldman ran for the assembly again as a socialist this time winning election waldman was a member of the state assembly new york co th d sitting in the st new york state legislature one of  socialists elected to the assembly of  the best electoral performance that the organization would ever achieve in november  waldman met with defeat but he ran again for state assembly in  against a fusion candidate of the democratic and republican parties and emerged victorious along with four other socialist party comrades august claessens samuel orr charles solomon and samuel a dewitt the five socialist assemblymen were suspended on the first day of the new legislative session by the republicandominated body and their expulsion trial before the judiciary committee of the assembly and subsequent court fight became a cause celebre of the red scare they were expelled on april  all five were reelected at a special election on september  and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on september  the next day dewitt and orr were permitted to take their seats but claessens solomon and waldman were expelled again protesting against the reexpulsion of their comrades dewitt and orr resigned their seats in  he ran on the socialist ticket for new york attorney general waldman was elected chairman of the socialist party of new york state in  a position which he retained through the first half of the s he also stood as the sp candidate for governor of new york in   and  polling over  votes in each of these races along with morris hillquit james oneal and algernon lee waldman was recognized as a leader of the sps old guard faction which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the american federation of labor and pursuance of gradual ameliorative reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation this perspective brought waldman and the old guard into opposition of the largely youth based militant faction in the party who favored reconciliation with the communist party usa in keeping with the united front policy of the comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalisms collapse factional leader in the sedit during the first half of the s waldman was one of the leading figures of the socalled old guard of the socialist party — an organized faction based in new york city which sought to continue the partys traditional orientation towards electoral politics and close cooperation with the trade union movement the old guard organized itself in opposition to a socalled militant faction which emerged in  and  consisting of younger and more radical members who sought a turn towards direct action and a program endorsing revolutionary socialism although both of these main factions considered themselves orthodox marxists the social democratic old guard considered their militant opponents to be adventurists with a deluded sense of enthusiasm for the soviet union and the world communist movement while the militants considered the old guard to be dyedinthewood reformists unwilling to challenge antidemocratic behavior in the union movement personal and personnel issues entered into play the militants sought to replace socialist party national chairman morris hillquit the best known and most widely respected of the old guard leaders as an impediment to the future growth of the party the old guard similarly sought the removal of the partys national executive secretary clarence senior a protégé of the charismatic spokesman for the radical wing of the party former presidential candidate norman thomas an outspoken pacifist who had made common cause with the organized militant group in an effort to build the spa into a mass movement the critical moment in the struggle between the two main factions came in june  at the socialist partys national convention in detroit michigan there the assembled delegates took up debate of an aggressively antimilitarist declaration of principles for the party written by thomas ally devere allen louis waldman was one of the key spokesmen for the old guard in the debate over this document at the detroit convention waldman took issue with the clause of the proposed declaration of principles which called for massed war resistance by the party in the face of a new war comrades what does that phrase mean massed war resistance is one of the clauses which constituted the basis of indictment of thousands of people during the last war massed war resistance is one of those provocative phrases which is capable of all kinds of construction what does a political party dedicated to lawful and peaceful struggle mean when it declares itself dedicated to the use of massed war resistance if it does not mean extralegal means for myself comrades it is inconceivable to me that i can remain a social democrat and become bound by this declaration i make my appeal to you comrades if we have to adjourn without a declaration i would a thousand times rather do that than commit the socialist party to an anarchistic illegal and communistic doctrine following the conclusion of debate the declaration of principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to the membership of the party for ratification by referendum vote the old guard minority issued a formal statement on the matter calling the declaration of principles inadequate and confused and a step towards turning the spa into an underground organization the old guard statement continued existing democracy incomplete though it be is immensely valuable to the workers through whose struggles it has been won let communists and fascists call it bogus our duty is to defend and perfect it the pledge to support any comrade coming into conflict with the law by any antiwar activity invites fanatics and provocators sic to join the party and involve it in responsibility for acts inconsistent with socialist prinicples it is also an incitement to unlawful acts such incitement is itself a crime for which courts could hold every party member liable the membership of the party was encouraged to defeat proposed new declaration of principles in favor of retention of the existing  declaration the  declaration of principles was ratified by the party membership nonetheless the factional war within the socialist party continued unabated for more than a year more with the old guard faction ultimately exiting the party en masse to form the social democratic federation sdf at the time of the partys may  convention in cleveland social democratic federation yearsedit louis waldman as he appeared at the time of publication of his first memoir in  waldman continued to play a leading role in the new sdf organization an organizational meeting was held of the new group in early july at which waldman sought to endorse franklin delano roosevelt for president of the united states in lieu of the socialist nominee norman thomas the gathering found itself split on the issue however and no endorsement was forthcoming waldmans foes such as new york socialist party executive secretary jack altman and socialist candidate for governor harry w laidler were quick to attack waldman charging him with a betrayal of socialist principles in attempting to divert  socialist votes to the roosevelt column many sdf members became involved in the american labor party when it was formed in  supporting the faction led by david dubinsky waldman however resigned from the alp in  feeling it had been taken over by a procommunist faction led by sidney hillman it was not for another four years until dubinsky and his supporters reached the same conclusion and bolted to form the liberal party after resigning from the alp waldman had virtually no political involvements and devoted himself to his law practice becoming one of the most distinguished labor lawyers in the nation during this period he represented walter krivitsky among others he was also active in the new york state bar association and served over the years on numerous state commissions representing unions as varied as the amalgamated clothing workers of america and the international longshoremens association waldman continued his practice right up to his death perspective of civil rights movementedit like many liberals of his time waldman expressed sympathy for the endeavors of civil rights activists but did not agree with their tactic of breaking the law in an article published by the new york state bar journal in  he expressed his worries he begins by assuring his readers that he espoused and still espouses the cause of civil rights for all people and then argues “those who assert rights under the constitution and the laws made thereunder must abide by that constitution and the law if that constitution is to survive they cannot pick and choose they cannot say they will abide by those laws which they think are just and refuse to abide by those laws which they think are unjust the country therefore cannot accept dr king’s doctrine that he and his followers will pick and choose knowing that it is illegal to do so i say such a doctrine is not only illegal and for that reason alone should be abandoned but that it is also immoral destructive of the principles of democratic government and a danger to the very civil rights dr king seeks to promote in such a way waldman asserted defying the law is on its face generally a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases especially if the legal system is basically decent therefore in order to meet this objection those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law answering waldmans objections king often used such a particular argument the evils being opposed were so serious so numerous and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort although the means were regrettable the end justified the means death and legacyedit louis waldman was married to bella b waldman with whom he had two sons he died on september   his papers reside at the new york public library vladeck waldman elias and engelhardtedit the law firm he helped found now vladeck waldman elias and engelhardt continues to exist as one of the leadingcitation needed labor law firms in new york labor lawyeredit in  louis waldman published his first autobiography labor lawyer in which he laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career among other things waldman became very critical of the new deal considering it to be overly accommodating to the communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies somewhat echoing the critique of the old right he was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during world war ii labor lawyer also represents an important primary source for the history of the socialist party in the years following the death of eugene victor debs it is worthy of note that many of the figures he denounces as dangerous procommunists in his book such as reinhold niebuhr and andrew biemiller would later become pillars of anticommunist liberals of the postwar years while waldman himself was mostly apolitical after the war this perspective clearly informed younger old guard supporters such as morrie ryskind and ralph de toledano who moved to the right from the anticommunist left time possibly whittaker chambers reviewed the book saying waldmans experiences in the years that followed were part of the tumultuous coming of age of us social consciousness labor lawyer waldmans autobiography is an esoteric jumble above all it is an old socialists insistent desperate warning against communism as the no  despoiler of the democratic ideal waldman believes that the strength of communism in the us is now reaching a new peak in the cios political action committee time july   the catchall for the political activities of unions dominated by communists militant

principles in attempting to divert  socialist votes to the roosevelt column many sdf members became involved in the american labor party when it was formed in  supporting the faction led by david dubinsky waldman however resigned from the alp in  feeling it had been taken over by a procommunist faction led by sidney hillman it was not for another four years until dubinsky and his supporters reached the same conclusion and bolted to form the liberal party after resigning from the alp waldman had virtually no political involvements and devoted himself to his law practice becoming one of the most distinguished labor lawyers in the nation during this period he represented walter krivitsky among others he was also active in the new york state bar association and served over the years on numerous state commissions representing unions as varied as the amalgamated clothing workers of america and the international longshoremens association waldman continued his practice right up to his death perspective of civil rights movementedit like many liberals of his time waldman expressed sympathy for the endeavors of civil rights activists but did not agree with their tactic of breaking the law in an article published by the new york state bar journal in  he expressed his worries he begins by assuring his readers that he espoused and still espouses the cause of civil rights for all people and then argues “those who assert rights under the constitution and the laws made thereunder must abide by that constitution and the law if that constitution is to survive they cannot pick and choose they cannot say they will abide by those laws which they think are just and refuse to abide by those laws which they think are unjust the country therefore cannot accept dr king’s doctrine that he and his followers will pick and choose knowing that it is illegal to do so i say such a doctrine is not only illegal and for that reason alone should be abandoned but that it is also immoral destructive of the principles of democratic government and a danger to the very civil rights dr king seeks to promote in such a way waldman asserted defying the law is on its face generally a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases especially if the legal system is basically decent therefore in order to meet this objection those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law answering waldmans objections king often used such a particular argument the evils being opposed were so serious so numerous and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort although the means were regrettable the end justified the means death and legacyedit louis waldman was married to bella b

occur during world war ii labor lawyer also represents an important primary source for the history of the socialist party in the years following the death of eugene victor debs it is worthy of note

early yearsedit louis waldman was born on january   in yancherudnia ukraine not far from kiev the son of a jewish innkeeper who was one of the few literate men of the village waldman emigrated to america in the summer  at the age of  arriving in new york city to join his sisters on september  waldman first worked in a metal shop before becoming an apprentice garment lining cutter in one of the sweatshops of the city he joined a union and participated in the week new york cloakmakers strike of  while attending high school in the evenings upon conclusion of the strike and resumption of his job waldman was fired and blacklisted for carrying out his function as a union representative in supervising the enforcement of the union contract in his shop barred from the garment industry waldman thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a doortodoor peddler of ribbon before taking a job in a cardboard box factory waldman graduated from high school in the spring of  and owing to a lack of funds for college enrolled in the cooper union to study engineering that fall waldman was a shocked member of the crowd on the street that witnessed the catastrophic triangle waist company fire of  an event which clearly always remained with him and served as one of the landmarks of his life waldman described the grim scene in his  memoirs one saturday afternoon in march of that year — march  to be precise — i was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old astor library it was a raw unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed i was deeply engrossed in my book when i became aware of fire engines racing past the building by this time i was sufficiently americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines along with several others in the library i ran out to see what was happening and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire a few blocks away the asch building at the corner of washington place and greene street was ablaze when we arrived at the scene the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze the eighth ninth and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames word had spread through the east side by some magic of terror that the plant of the triangle waist company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped horrified and helpless the crowds — i among them — looked up at the burning building saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows pause for a terrified moment and then leap to the pavement below to land as mangled bloody pulp this went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and screaming with clothing and hair ablaze plunged like a living torch to the street life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies the emotions of the crowd were indescribable women were hysterical scores fainted men wept as in paroxysms of frenzy they hurled themselves against the police lines  packed into a tight space and locked away from means of escape  workers from the buildings th floor died that day in one of the greatest tragedies in new york citys history at a memorial meeting held at cooper union in the aftermath of the fire waldman saw and heard socialist leader morris hillquit speak for the first time an event which inspired waldman to engage in a veritable orgy of reading on socialism and thereby won the young man over to the socialist cause waldman graduated from cooper union in june  with a degree in engineering and worked as a construction engineer during the day while following his ambition to become a lawyer by attending law school in the evenings he was admitted to the new york state bar in  and worked thereafter as counsel for the amalgamated clothing workers of america for the new york central trades and labor council and for various other unions in the building and garment trades socialist in the new york assemblyedit louis waldman c  in  the young engineer louis waldman was approached at a meeting of his socialist party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the new york state assembly although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning the party official approaching him smiled and replied campaigning who said anything about campaigning we just want someone to run for office if you get more than seven hundred votes well be lucky the real campaigns this year will be for meyer london and morris hillquit and thus was born a socialist party politician waldman did actually campaign however mounting the platform to give public speeches at which he gradually improved waldman performed well in the  election tripling the socialist tally while losing to his democratic opponent by a few hundred votes in the fall of  with america embroiled in the european conflict and a section of the american electorate radicalized by the turn towards war by the democratic administration of woodrow wilson waldman ran for the assembly again as a socialist this time winning election waldman was a member of the state assembly new york co th d sitting in the st new york state legislature one of  socialists elected to the assembly of  the best electoral performance that the organization would ever achieve in november  waldman met with defeat but he ran again for state assembly in  against a fusion candidate of the democratic and republican parties and emerged victorious along with four other socialist party comrades august claessens samuel orr charles solomon and samuel a dewitt the five socialist assemblymen were suspended on the first day of the new legislative session by the republicandominated body and their expulsion trial before the judiciary committee of the assembly and subsequent court fight became a cause celebre of the red scare they were expelled on april  all five were reelected at a special election on september  and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on september  the next day dewitt and orr were permitted to take their seats but claessens solomon and waldman were expelled again protesting against the reexpulsion of their comrades dewitt and orr resigned their seats in  he ran on the socialist ticket for new york attorney general waldman was elected chairman of the socialist party of new york state in  a position which he retained through the first half of the s he also stood as the sp candidate for governor of new york in   and  polling over  votes in each of these races along with morris hillquit james oneal and algernon lee waldman was recognized as a leader of the sps old guard faction which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the american federation of labor and pursuance of gradual ameliorative reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation this perspective brought waldman and the old guard into opposition of the largely youth based militant faction in the party who favored reconciliation with the communist party usa in keeping with the united front policy of the comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalisms collapse factional leader in the sedit during the first half of the s waldman was one of the leading figures of the socalled old guard of the socialist party — an organized faction based in new york city which sought to continue the partys traditional orientation towards electoral politics and close cooperation with the trade union movement the old guard organized itself in opposition to a socalled militant faction which emerged in  and  consisting of younger and more radical members who sought a turn towards direct action and a program endorsing revolutionary socialism although both of these main factions considered themselves orthodox marxists the social democratic old guard considered their militant opponents to be adventurists with a deluded sense of enthusiasm for the soviet union and the world communist movement while the militants considered the old guard to be dyedinthewood reformists unwilling to challenge antidemocratic behavior in the union movement personal and personnel issues entered into play the militants sought to replace socialist party national chairman morris hillquit the best known and most widely respected of the old guard leaders as an impediment to the future growth of the party the old guard similarly sought the removal of the partys national executive secretary clarence senior a protégé of the charismatic spokesman for the radical wing of the party former presidential candidate norman thomas an outspoken pacifist who had made common cause with the organized militant group in an effort to build the spa into a mass movement the critical moment in the struggle between the two main factions came in june  at the socialist partys national convention in detroit michigan there the assembled delegates took up debate of an aggressively antimilitarist declaration of principles for the party written by thomas ally devere allen louis waldman was one of the key spokesmen for the old guard in the debate over this document at the detroit convention waldman took issue with the clause of the proposed declaration of principles which called for massed war resistance by the party in the face of a new war comrades what does that phrase mean massed war resistance is one of the clauses which constituted the basis of indictment of thousands of people during the last war massed war resistance is one of those provocative phrases which is capable of all kinds of construction what does a political party dedicated to lawful and peaceful struggle mean when it declares itself dedicated to the use of massed war resistance if it does not mean extralegal means for myself comrades it is inconceivable to me that i can remain a social democrat and become bound by this declaration i make my appeal to you comrades if we have to adjourn without a declaration i would a thousand times rather do that than commit the socialist party to an anarchistic illegal and communistic doctrine following the conclusion of debate the declaration of principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to the membership of the party for ratification by referendum vote the old guard minority issued a formal statement on the matter calling the declaration of principles inadequate and confused and a step towards turning the spa into an underground organization the old guard statement continued existing democracy incomplete though it be is immensely valuable to the workers through whose struggles it has been won let communists and fascists call it bogus our duty is to defend and perfect it the pledge to support any comrade coming into conflict with the law by any antiwar activity invites fanatics and provocators sic to join the party and involve it in responsibility for acts inconsistent with socialist prinicples it is also an incitement to unlawful acts such incitement is itself a crime for which courts could hold every party member liable the membership of the party was encouraged to defeat proposed new declaration of principles in favor of retention of the existing  declaration the  declaration of principles was ratified by the party membership nonetheless the factional war within the socialist party continued unabated for more than a year more with the old guard faction ultimately exiting the party en masse to form the social democratic federation sdf at the time of the partys may  convention in cleveland social democratic federation yearsedit louis waldman as he appeared at the time of publication of his first memoir in  waldman continued to play a leading role in the new sdf organization an organizational meeting was held of the new group in early july at which waldman sought to endorse franklin

early yearsedit louis waldman was born on january   in yancherudnia ukraine not far from kiev the son of a jewish innkeeper who was one of the few literate men of the village waldman emigrated to america in the summer  at the age of  arriving in new york city to join his sisters on september  waldman first worked in a metal shop before becoming an apprentice garment lining cutter in one of the sweatshops of the city he joined a union and participated in the week new york cloakmakers strike of  while attending high school in the evenings upon conclusion of the strike and resumption of his job waldman was fired and blacklisted for carrying out his function as a union representative in supervising the enforcement of the union contract in his shop barred from the garment industry waldman thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a doortodoor peddler of ribbon before taking a job in a cardboard box factory waldman graduated from high school in the spring of  and owing to a lack of funds for college enrolled in the cooper union to study engineering that fall waldman was a shocked member of the crowd on the street that witnessed the catastrophic triangle waist company fire of  an event which clearly always remained with him and served as one of the landmarks of his life waldman described the grim scene in his  memoirs one saturday afternoon in march of that year — march  to be precise — i was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old astor library it was a raw unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed i was deeply engrossed in my book when i became aware of fire engines racing past the building by this time i was sufficiently americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines along with several others in the library i ran out to see what was happening and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire a few blocks away the asch building at the corner of washington place and greene street was ablaze when we arrived at the scene the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze the eighth ninth and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames word had spread through the east side by some magic of terror that the plant of the triangle waist company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped horrified and helpless the crowds — i among them — looked up at the burning building saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows pause for a terrified moment and then leap to the pavement below to land as mangled bloody pulp this went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and screaming with clothing and hair ablaze plunged like a living torch to the street life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies the emotions of the crowd were indescribable women were hysterical scores fainted men wept as in paroxysms of frenzy they hurled themselves against the police lines  packed into a tight space and locked away from means of escape  workers from the buildings th floor died that day in one of the greatest tragedies in new york citys history at a memorial meeting held at cooper union in the aftermath of the fire waldman saw and heard socialist leader morris hillquit speak for the first time an event which inspired waldman to engage in a veritable orgy of reading on socialism and thereby won the young man over to the socialist cause waldman graduated from cooper union in june  with a degree in engineering and worked as a construction engineer during the day while following his ambition to become a lawyer by attending law school in the evenings he was admitted to the new york state bar in  and worked thereafter as counsel for the amalgamated clothing workers of america for the new york central trades and labor council and for various other unions in the building and garment trades socialist in the new york assemblyedit louis waldman c  in  the young engineer louis waldman was approached at a meeting of his socialist party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the new york state assembly although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning the party official approaching him smiled and replied campaigning who said anything about campaigning we just want someone to run for office if you get more than seven hundred votes well be lucky the real campaigns this year will be for meyer london and morris hillquit and thus was born a socialist party politician waldman did actually campaign however mounting the platform to give public speeches at which he gradually improved waldman performed well in the  election tripling the socialist tally while losing to his democratic opponent by a few hundred votes in the fall of  with america embroiled in the european conflict and a section of the american electorate radicalized by the turn towards war by the democratic administration of woodrow wilson waldman ran for the assembly again as a socialist this time winning election waldman was a member of the state assembly new york co th d sitting in the st new york state legislature one of  socialists elected to the assembly of  the best electoral performance that the organization would ever achieve in november  waldman met with defeat but he ran again for state assembly in  against a fusion candidate of the democratic and republican parties and emerged victorious along with four other socialist party comrades august claessens samuel orr charles solomon and samuel a dewitt the five socialist assemblymen were suspended on the first day of the new legislative session by the republicandominated body and their expulsion trial before the judiciary committee of the assembly and subsequent court fight became a cause celebre of the red scare they were expelled on april  all five were reelected at a special election on september  and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on september  the next day dewitt and orr were permitted to take their seats but claessens solomon and waldman were expelled again protesting against the reexpulsion of their comrades dewitt and orr resigned their seats in  he ran on the socialist ticket for new york attorney general waldman was elected chairman of the socialist party of new york state in  a position which he retained through the first half of the s he also stood as the sp candidate for governor of new york in   and  polling over  votes in each of these races along with morris hillquit james oneal and algernon lee waldman was recognized as a leader of the sps old guard faction which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the american federation of labor and pursuance of gradual ameliorative reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation this perspective brought waldman and the old guard into opposition of the largely youth based militant faction in the party who favored reconciliation with the communist party usa in keeping with the united front policy of the comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalisms collapse factional leader in the sedit during the first half of the s waldman was one of the leading figures of the socalled old guard of the socialist party — an organized faction based in new york city which sought to continue the partys traditional orientation towards electoral politics and close cooperation with the trade union movement the old guard organized itself in opposition to a socalled militant faction which emerged in  and  consisting of younger and more radical members who sought a turn towards direct action and a program endorsing revolutionary socialism although both of these main factions considered themselves orthodox marxists the social democratic old guard considered their militant opponents to be adventurists with a deluded sense of enthusiasm for the soviet union and the world communist movement while the militants considered the old guard to be dyedinthewood reformists unwilling to challenge antidemocratic behavior in the union movement personal and personnel issues entered into play the militants sought to replace socialist party national chairman morris hillquit the best known and most widely respected of the old guard leaders as an impediment to the future growth of the party the old guard similarly sought the removal of the partys national executive secretary clarence senior a protégé of the charismatic spokesman for the radical wing of the party former presidential candidate norman thomas an outspoken pacifist who had made common cause with the organized militant group in an effort to build the spa into a mass movement the critical moment in the struggle between the two main factions came in june  at the socialist partys national convention in detroit michigan there the assembled delegates took up debate of an aggressively antimilitarist declaration of principles for the party written by thomas ally devere allen louis waldman was one of the key spokesmen for the old guard in the debate over this document at the detroit convention waldman took issue with the clause of the proposed declaration of principles which called for massed war resistance by the party in the face of a new war comrades what does that phrase mean massed war resistance is one of the clauses which constituted the basis of indictment of thousands of people during the last war massed war resistance is one of those provocative phrases which is capable of all kinds of construction what does a political party dedicated to lawful and peaceful struggle mean when it declares itself dedicated to the use of massed war resistance if it does not mean extralegal means for myself comrades it is inconceivable to me that i can remain a social democrat and become bound by this declaration i make my appeal to you comrades if we have to adjourn without a declaration i would a thousand times rather do that than commit the socialist party to an anarchistic illegal and communistic doctrine following the conclusion of debate the declaration of principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to the membership of the party for ratification by referendum vote the old guard minority issued a formal statement on the matter calling the declaration of principles inadequate and confused and a step towards turning the spa into an underground organization the old guard statement continued existing democracy incomplete though it be is immensely valuable to the workers through whose struggles it has been won let communists and fascists call it bogus our duty is to defend and perfect it the pledge to support any comrade coming into conflict with the law by any antiwar activity invites fanatics and provocators sic to join the party and involve it in responsibility for acts inconsistent with socialist prinicples it is also an incitement to unlawful acts such incitement is itself a crime for which courts could hold every party member liable the membership of the party was encouraged to defeat proposed new declaration of principles in favor of retention of the existing  declaration the  declaration of principles was ratified by the party membership nonetheless the factional war within the socialist party continued unabated for more than a year more with the old guard faction ultimately exiting the party en masse to form the social democratic federation sdf at the time of the partys may  convention in cleveland social democratic federation yearsedit louis waldman as he appeared at the time of publication of his first memoir in  waldman continued to play a leading role in the new sdf organization an organizational meeting was held of the new group in early july at which waldman sought to endorse franklin delano roosevelt for president of the united states in lieu of the socialist nominee norman thomas the gathering found itself split on the issue however and no endorsement was forthcoming waldmans foes such as new york socialist party executive secretary jack altman and socialist candidate for governor harry w laidler were quick to attack waldman charging him with a betrayal of socialist principles in attempting to divert  socialist votes to the roosevelt column many sdf members became involved in the american labor party when it was formed in  supporting the faction led by david dubinsky waldman however resigned from the alp in  feeling it had been taken over by a procommunist faction led by sidney hillman it was not for another four years until dubinsky and his supporters reached the same conclusion and bolted to form the liberal party after resigning from the alp waldman had virtually no political involvements and devoted himself to his law practice becoming one of the most distinguished labor lawyers in the nation during this period he represented walter krivitsky among others he was also active in the new york state bar association and served over the years on numerous state commissions representing unions as varied as the amalgamated clothing workers of america and the international longshoremens association waldman continued his practice right up to his death perspective of civil rights movementedit like many liberals of his time waldman expressed sympathy for the endeavors of civil rights activists but did not agree with their tactic of breaking the law in an article published by the new york state bar journal in  he expressed his worries he begins by assuring his readers that he espoused and still espouses the cause of civil rights for all people and then argues “those who assert rights under the constitution and the laws made thereunder must abide by that constitution and the law if that constitution is to survive they cannot pick and choose they cannot say they will abide by those laws which they think are just and refuse to abide by those laws which they think are unjust the country therefore cannot accept dr king’s doctrine that he and his followers will pick and choose knowing that it is illegal to do so i say such a doctrine is not only illegal and for that reason alone should be abandoned but that it is also immoral destructive of the principles of democratic government and a danger to the very civil rights dr king seeks to promote in such a way waldman asserted defying the law is on its face generally a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases especially if the legal system is basically decent therefore in order to meet this objection those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law answering waldmans objections king often used such a particular argument the evils being opposed were so serious so numerous and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort although the means were regrettable the end justified the means death and legacyedit louis waldman was married to bella b waldman with whom he had two sons he died on september   his papers reside at the new york public library vladeck waldman elias and engelhardtedit the law firm he helped found now vladeck waldman elias and engelhardt continues to exist as one of the leadingcitation needed labor law firms in new york labor lawyeredit in  louis waldman published his first autobiography labor lawyer in which he laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career among other things waldman became very critical of the new deal considering it to be overly accommodating to the communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies somewhat echoing the critique of the old right he was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during world war ii labor lawyer also represents an important primary source for the history of the socialist party in the years following the death of eugene victor debs it is worthy of note that many of the figures he denounces as dangerous procommunists in his book such as reinhold niebuhr and andrew biemiller would later become pillars of anticommunist liberals of the postwar years while waldman himself was mostly apolitical after the war this perspective clearly informed younger old guard supporters such as morrie ryskind and ralph de toledano who moved to the right from the anticommunist left time possibly whittaker chambers reviewed the book saying waldmans experiences in the years that followed were part of the tumultuous coming of age of us social consciousness labor lawyer waldmans autobiography is an esoteric jumble above all it is an old socialists insistent desperate warning against communism as the no  despoiler of the democratic ideal waldman believes that the strength of communism in the us is now reaching a new peak in the cios political action committee time july   the catchall for the political activities of unions dominated by communists militant socialists and others willing to cooperate with them he concludes flatly unless the new deal casts out the seeds of leftwing totalitarianism which it fosters today it may either lead to an american variety of communism or what is more likely provoke an american expression of unadorned fascism waldman published a second memoir the good fight in  footnotesedit  louis waldman labor lawyer new york
