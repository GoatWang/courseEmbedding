consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions the methods estimates and judgment we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based upon this definition our most critical estimates relate to the fair value of warrant liabilities impairment of longlived assets commitments and contingencies and revenue recognition we also have other key accounting estimates and policies but we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period for additional information see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report although we believe that our estimates and
