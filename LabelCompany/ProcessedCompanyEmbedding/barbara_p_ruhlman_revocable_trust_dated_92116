effect on the company generally speaking the compensation policies are consistent for all business units of the company additionally incentives are not designed to and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company as the incentives generally reward growth and profitability the companys various bonus programs are based on consistent growth of the company relying for example on the total return on investment or including language that requires any increases in sales to be on appropriate and consistent margins as such they do not encourage employees to take risks in order to receive incentive compensation nor are they reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company    directors and executive officers compensation compensation discussion and analysis   role of the compensation committee the compensation committee the committee administers the companys executive compensation programs the committees primary role is to oversee the companys compensation and benefit plans and policies for its elected executive officers including the executive officers listed in the summary compensation table below named executive officers or neos who are the companys principal executive officer robert g ruhlman chairman president and chief executive officer principal financial officer eric r graef chief financial officer and vice president  finance and the three other most highly compensated executive officers the committee reviews and approves all executive compensation decisions relating to the officers including all neos in the performance of its duties the committee has the authority to allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to a committee formed for that purpose subject to approval from the entire board additionally the committee may select and appoint outside consultants to assist it philosophy of the compensation program the philosophy of the committee is to provide a compensation program that will attract motivate and retain key members of the leadership team in order to give the company a competitive advantage while ensuring the success and growth of the company the compensation program should ensure that a significant portion of compensation will be directly related to the companys performance by tying annual cash bonus and longterm incentive awards to company performance the compensation program is intended to motivate the officers to enable the company to achieve its shortterm and longterm business goals the committee has three goals to guide it in this endeavor a compensation paid to officers should be aligned with the performance of the company on both a long and shortterm basis b compensation should be competitive within the employment environment and c compensation should be designed to reward officers for meeting performance targets compensation program the committee strives to craft a compensation program that pays the officers at competitive levels reflective of their individual responsibilities while maintaining consistency and pay equity among the individual officers the committee conducts an annual review of the compensation program as well as changes in the overall composition of the management team and the responsibilities of the individual officers to ensure that the compensation is competitive within the market supports retention objectives and is internally equitable reliance upon various tools and the findings from such tools assists the committee in its analysis and leads to decisions regarding the mix of the various compensation elements to be included additionally the cost of the compensation program is considered in recognition that the optimal compensation program motivates employees to improve company results on a costeffective basis typically the committee finalizes compensation elements for a calendar year in december of the prior year tools and findings from analysis  the committee relies upon tools to analyze the compensation program internally and within the competitive landscape historically these tools have been outside data compiled by various consultants tally sheets detailing overall compensation packages for each individual officer and discussions with the ceo regarding performance levels and goals the committee also considers the results of the most recent nonbinding advisory say on pay vote of the companys shareholders on executive compensation consultant the committee has the authority to retain its own advisor for  the committee did not retain an advisor    external data  the committee generally relies upon various independent surveys which are matched to specific positions with similar functional descriptions as those for the officers the committee reviews surveys primarily to gain perspective on how the companys executive compensation compares to other similarlysized companies so that it can assess whether the companys pay levels are generally competitive and represent a reward for strong performance for  the committee utilized the towerswatson annual compensation level survey using this independent survey the committee analyzed the compensation paid to officers including the ceo compared against the compensation paid to executives holding equivalent positions in the peer classification group consisting of surveyed manufacturers of durable goods with employment levels of between  and  the peer group the survey did not include any revenue limitations as using such limitations would have resulted in a peer group that was too small to be statistically relevant the committee reviews base salary and total compensation at both the  th and  th percentile levels to highlight where the companys compensation is relative to peers for competitive purposes and takes into account the individuals experience and performance and the companys results for  the officers including the ceo were near the  th percentile when reviewing base salary alone the committee decided that salary levels that are near the  th percentile were appropriate for  given the sales and operating income levels achieved by the company the committee also reviews total cash compensation which included salary and the maximum available bonus for the officers and compares that data with the peer group data the committee does not engage in specific benchmarking when comparing total compensation because a significant portion is tied to the companys performance which can cause a great variation relative to the amounts paid by comparable companies with different performance results as a result the committee considers the total compensation paid by other companies to ensure that the companys pay is competitive and to assess whether its payout levels for strong performance represents an incentive to achieve such performance for  total compensation of the officers was found to align near the  th percentile depending on the actual payout to be achieved discussions with the ceo all of the nonceo officers report directly to the ceo who performs a yearly evaluation of the performance of each officer the ceos assessment of the individual performance forms the basis for the proposed compensation levels of each officer other than the ceo in light of the information derived from the aforementioned survey the ceo provides a written evaluation for each officer other than the ceo that includes his recommendations for salary adjustments for the subsequent year to the committee which weighs these recommendations in determining salary levels results of  say on pay vote  the proxy statement filed by the company in  included a nonbinding advisory say on pay vote on executive compensation although the vote was nonbinding the board of directors and the committee value the opinions of the shareholders and considered the outcome of the vote when making  compensation decisions for the companys neos the companys compensation program received an affirmative vote from over  of the companys common shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy at the  annual meeting the company views this shareholder approval as an endorsement of a sound compensation program the companys shareholders are being asked to cast a nonbinding advisory sayonpay vote on executive compensation at the  annual meeting of shareholders see proposal two advisory vote on executive compensation compensation elements  the company recognizes that its success depends in large part on a leadership team with the skills and commitment necessary to successfully manage a global organization the compensation program assists in achieving this objective by relying on the elements of compensation detailed below certain elements are designed to enable the company to attract and retain the officers with the skills to anticipate and respond to the market while other elements are intended to motivate the officers to achieve financial results to enhance shareholder value the companys  compensation program for officers consisted of the following elements        base salaries        annual cash incentive awards        longterm equity grants        retirement benefits and        health and welfare benefits      the company structures the total compensation program so that its reliance on any particular element of compensation is flexible thus the compensation program strives to meet the goals outlined above by balancing shortterm ie base salaries annual cash incentive awards and longterm incentives ie longterm equity grants competitively in the market and to address the volatility in the companys performance due to external factors there is no difference in the policies and their application for each of the officers except for the ceo base salaries  the companys goal is to establish salaries at a level sufficient to attract and retain talented executives this goal is based on the companys belief that it is important to maintain salary levels near a midpoint of comparable company executives to be competitive within the general market and the peer group the base salaries of the officers are reviewed annually in each case factors considered in establishing an officers salary level include a review of the individuals performance initiated by the ceo an accounting of the companys performance the experience level for the position the peer group executive compensation information derived from the independent compensation survey using companies in similar industries and with similar employee levels and internal equity for  the committee ratified the ceos recommendations for no increases for either the officers or the ceo in light of the companys performance and a return to a biannual salary review for the officers annual cash incentive awards  the annual cash incentive award is designed to motivate and reward the officers for their contributions to the companys performance by making a significant portion of their total compensation variable and dependent upon the companys annual financial performance it is tied directly to the financial performance of the company on a sliding scale of return on shareholders equity the committee believes that compensating management by aligning compensation with shareholders return on their investment is an effective way to connect the achievement of performance goals and to encourage growth in the company while rewarding officers for their contributions the calculation is based on the companys pretax return on equity and assessed over a range of  to  the implied target is  which assumes a linear symmetrical bonus curve with onehalf of the maximum bonus earned at the midpoint of the performance range from this calculation the awards are determined based on a schedule that provides certain percentages to be applied to base salaries the companys pretax return on shareholders equity for  was  which would have resulted in a payout of  for the ceo and  for the other neos the maximum bonuses are  of salary for the ceo and  of salary for the other officers the committee has the ability to exercise discretion and make adjustments and in reviewing the  payout amounts the committee recognized the extraordinary effort of the management team during difficult economic conditions for the companys industry because the companys customers are primarily governments or governmentalregulated entities the economic woes facing the majority of governments in the last few years have forced most of the customers to curtail capital expenditures as such capital expenditures at public utilities around the world have slowed precipitously due to these significant variations in market demand the committee believed that the management team should receive a greater bonus at lower levels of return on shareholders equity to also compensate them for achievements with respect to market share and volumerelated expense management the committee approved an adjustment of the annual cash bonus award so that the cash incentive awards for  were  of salary for the ceo and  of salary for the other neos longterm equity grants  the committee has the discretion under the companys equity award plans to set the amounts and terms of any equity compensation and may vary the equity award program from year to year to address the companys thencurrent compensation objectives and strategic goals the committee believes that the companys shareholders will be well served if a greater percentage of the longterm equity incentive program is related to achievement of the companys boardapproved strategic objectives to that end the balanced lti program consisting of service vested restricted share units rsus and performance vested rsus is a way to achieve its objectives generally performancevesting aligns executive longterm incentive rewards more directly with shareholders interests since achieving strategic objectives is a better measure of managements performance than the volatility of the stock market furthermore the committee believes that the shareholders are served well by decisions that further the companys longterm strategic plan the committee also believes that the ceos longterm incentive should generally be  dependent on the achievement of the companys strategic objectives nevertheless the committee believes that it is appropriate to include some service vested rsus in the longterm incentive program of the other officers in order to encourage retention of key executives over the duration of a business cycle additionally upon vesting it was mandated that the officers defer receipt of the shares received from the grants in  through  until at the earliest their retirementtermination date this policy was replaced by the ownership guidelines discussed below in     longterm equity incentive grants were made under the preformed line products company long term incentive plan of  ltip which was initially approved by the board and by the shareholders in  and amended and restated by the board and approved by the shareholders during  going forward long term incentive grants will be made under the  incentive plan  plan which was approved by the board and by the shareholders in  the ceos typical annual equity compensation awards are performancebased rsus vesting in three years based upon achieving performance standards approved at the time of the grant by the companys board of directors the typical annual equity compensation awards to the other participants are as follows twothirds of the award is performancebased rsus vesting in three years based on achieving performance standards approved at the time of the grant by the companys board of directors and onethird of the award is servicebased rsus vesting three years after the date of the grant based solely on continued employment by the company the committee chose to emphasize performance over three years rather than weigh performance and service equally because it believes this approach aligns the companys performance with shareholders interests while acknowledging the benefit from longterm service for the performancebased rsus the number of shares in which the participant becomes vested will depend upon the specific level of growth in pretax income and sales growth measured over a specified period historically either oneyear or threeyear performance period with thresholds of   and  for pretax income growth and   and  for sales growth the threshold payout is at  of the maximum number of performancebased rsus if both measures are achieved the target is at  if both  growth in pretax income and  growth in sales are achieved and the maximum is at  of the number of rsus subject to the award if  growth in each measure is achieved at the end of the threeyear period if only one of the two measures is achieved at any of these levels the vesting percentage is weighted to provide for some additional vesting for achieving the higher measure dividends declared on rsus are accrued as cash dividends for the  grants the committee once again analyzed the history of the rsu grants and whether such grants effectively aligned the interests of the neos with the companys interests taking into account industry data and input from officers regarding the companys markets projections and costs the committees intention is to incentivize management to grow the company while maintaining profit margins given the economic conditions and volatile company performance over the past few years and the challenges in forecasting the external factors that drive the companys sales the committee determined that it would use a threeyear base as it had done so from  to  to measure growth during the performance period and set the performance metrics at the growth percentages discussed above the committee recommended and the board approved the grants in february  to each of the officers including the ceo the ceos award is set at a number of rsus equal to  of the ceos salary if target performance is achieved with a maximum award equal to  of his salary if the maximum performance is achieved the awards to the other officers are as follows the award is set at a number of rsus equal to that percentage of participants salary that is specified at the time of grant if target performance is achieved the maximum amount of the performance portion of the award is equal to two times the target award the amount of the servicevested award that can be earned is equal to the target award each officer was granted the number of rsus equal to the maximum level under the performance criteria retirement benefits  the company believes that retirement benefits are an important component of total compensation the companys primary retirement benefit consists of the companys k and profit sharing plan under which all salaried employees of the company including officers participate starting in their third year of employment the amount the company provides to the profit sharing plan is based on the recommendation of management with the boards approval typically the companys contribution under this plan is approximately  of the thencurrent years cash compensation which is consistent with the amount contributed for all fulltime salaried employees of the company including the cash incentive award when calculating the companys contributions under    the profit sharing plan the company does not consider gains from prior awards every aspect of this plan is the same for all salaried employees including officers thus each salaried participant elects the investment options with the same options offered to all salaried employees and officers the plan does not involve any guaranteed minimum return or abovemarket returns rather the investment returns are dependent upon actual investment results to the extent an employees award exceeds the maximum allowable contribution permitted under existing tax laws the excess is accrued for but not funded under a nonqualified supplemental profit sharing plan the return under this supplemental profit sharing plan is calculated at a weighted average of the treasury constant maturity oneyear rate plus  executive perquisites  perquisites and other personal benefits do not comprise a significant aspect of the companys compensation program although officers participate in the same benefit programs as the companys other employees the company provides a few additional benefits to its officers these benefits are designed to enable the officers to balance their personal business and travel schedules in  benefits include the companys payment of club dues which was less than  annually per membership for three of the neos as indicated in the accompanying summary compensation table the company also pays annual dues for robert g ruhlman at a club located near the companys rogers arkansas facility which totaled approximately  in  this benefit is also provided to four other nonofficer employees primarily for business entertainment purposes except as described here the company aircraft is available to all of the employees including the officers for businessrelated travel only the ceo is permitted to use the companys aircraft for personal purposes as shown on the summary compensation table the company also makes personal financial advice available to the ceo and tax advice available to all its officers ownership guidelines  in  the board established a requirement that the neos defer receipt of all shares received upon vesting of rsus until retirement or termination of employment upon advice from aon hewitt during its  engagement the committee determined that ownership guidelines would provide a more flexible way to ensure executives maintain sufficient ownership position in the company in february  the committee recommended and the board approved ownership guidelines to ensure that the neos have a stake in the future of the company in lieu of the deferral requirement the ownership guidelines require the ceo to hold six times his annualized base salary in equity of the company and the other officers to hold three times their annualized base salaries the ownership guidelines state that the types of equity that count toward the ownership requirement are stock owned directly stock owned in a companysponsored retirement plan and the unvested portion of rsus that are subject only to timevesting each covered executive will have up to five years from the effective date of the  ownership guidelines or the date such person becomes a covered executive to meet the stock ownership requirement tax deductibility of pay  section m of the internal revenue code of  places a limit of  million on the amount of compensation that a company may deduct in any one year with respect to each of its neos all officers were below this threshold in  except the ceo compensation committee

nonbinding basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with sec rules executive compensation is an important matter for the companys shareholders as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled compensation discussion and analysis cda a fundamental principle the companys executive compensation philosophy and

its shareholders you are urged to read the cda section of this proxy statement for additional details on the companys executive compensation including the companys compensation philosophy and objectives for the compensation of the neos as an advisory vote this proposal is nonbinding although the vote is nonbinding the board of directors and the compensation committee value the opinions of the shareholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for the companys neos proposal three advisory vote on frequency of voting on executive compensation   the board recommends that you vote for every three years for the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation the company is required under the doddfrank act to seek a nonbinding advisory shareholder vote every six years regarding the frequency annually every other year or every three years at which the company will ask its shareholders to provide the advisory vote on executive compensation the company believes that holding the advisory vote on executive compensation every three years is appropriate given the history of few changes to the executive compensation as well as the composition of the officers and the cycle on reviewing compensation policies as followed by the compensation committee therefore the company is asking shareholders to vote for every three years for the frequency of executive pay voting    as an advisory vote this proposal is nonbinding although the vote is nonbinding the board of directors and the compensation committee value the
