production micl lenses that could be used to monitor shelflife we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate your firm’s technical study document number trr revision a dated “” to assess the functional performance of the icl at the end of labeled shelf life failed to indicate the finished product approval date and lens sizes of the sample lenses used for this study also your response states your firm used “b lenses” for this study instead of micl lenses please identify which lens serial numbers listed in the technical study are b lenses also please submit objective evidence demonstrating that the b lenses manufacturing process from beginning to end is identical to the micl also explain why sterility testing is not performed during interval testing and at

multiple firm management were interviewed during the inspection concerning the software its use and its source a software development planspecification and validation for a micl calculator was provided finally on day seven of the inspection the firm stated that they provided this software to their subcontractor b but do not know which codealgorithms from this plan were incorporated into the current staar website calculator moreover this software calculator was never submitted in the pma filing to the fda we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate because your
