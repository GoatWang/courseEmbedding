company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor

causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to

suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing

controversiesedit clean air act violationedit in july  caterpillar and five other diesel engine manufacturers signed a consent decree with the justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal agents raided caterpillars headquarters in peoria ill it was

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness caterpillar company formed edit a horsepower caterpillar sixty being used for road work in the cibola national forest new mexico united states in  the banks who held the companys large debt forced the holt board of directors to accept their candidate thomas a baxter to succeed benjamin holt baxter initially cut the large tractors from the companys product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the caterpillar tractor co the new company was headquartered in san leandro until  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to peoria baxter had been removed as ceo earlier in  and clarence leo best assumed the title of ceo and remained in that role until october  the caterpillar company consolidated its product lines offering only five tracktype tractors the  ton  ton and  ton from the holt

a sharp downturn in product demand as competition with japanese rival komatsu increased at the time komatsu used the internal slogan encircle caterpillar caterpillar suffered further when the united states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for  months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in  caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  to  per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of  that was paid to workers at deere  company in  during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry analysts caterpillar began to execute a southern strategy this involved opening new smaller plants termed focus facilities in righttowork states caterpillar opened these new facilities in clayton and sanford north carolina greenville south carolina corinth mississippi dyersburg tennessee griffin and lagrange georgia seguin texas and north little rock arkansas in  the company locked out workers at

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal agents raided caterpillars headquarters in peoria ill it was already evident that the company engaged in aggressive measures to control tax costs since april  the companys tax policies have been

subsidiary caterpillar sarl csarl in geneva in  the former caterpillar executive daniel schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits from replacement parts to switzerland where it had no warehouses or factories the internal revenue service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years  to  at the same time the architect of caterpillars fiscal strategy

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness caterpillar company formed edit a horsepower caterpillar sixty being used for road work in the cibola national forest new mexico united states in  the banks who held the companys large debt forced the holt board of directors to accept their candidate thomas a baxter to succeed benjamin holt baxter initially cut the large tractors from the companys product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the caterpillar tractor co the new company was headquartered in san leandro until  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to peoria baxter had been removed as ceo earlier in  and clarence leo

a sharp downturn in product demand as competition with japanese rival komatsu increased at the time komatsu used the internal slogan encircle caterpillar caterpillar suffered further when the united states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for  months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in  caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  to  per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of  that was paid to workers at deere  company in  during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry analysts caterpillar began to execute a southern strategy this involved opening new smaller plants termed focus facilities in righttowork states caterpillar opened these new facilities in clayton and sanford north carolina greenville south carolina corinth mississippi dyersburg tennessee griffin and lagrange georgia seguin texas and north little rock arkansas in  the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in london ontario canada and demanded some accept up to a  cut in pay in order to become costcompetitive with comparable caterpillar manufacturing facilities in the united states

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal agents raided caterpillars headquarters in peoria ill it was already evident that the company engaged in aggressive measures to control tax costs since april  the companys tax policies have been

warehouses or factories the internal revenue service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years  to  at the same time the architect of caterpillars fiscal strategy pricewaterhousecoopers pwc came also under scrutiny owing this to a conflict of interest acting as caterpillars global tax consultant and controller the senate uncovered documents from pwc saying the

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness caterpillar company formed edit a horsepower caterpillar sixty being used for road work in the cibola national forest new mexico united states in  the banks who held the companys large debt forced the holt board of directors to accept their candidate thomas a baxter to succeed benjamin holt baxter initially cut the large tractors from the companys product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the caterpillar tractor co the new company was headquartered in san leandro until  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to peoria baxter had been removed as ceo earlier in  and clarence leo

caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the

analysts caterpillar began to execute a southern strategy this involved opening new smaller plants termed focus facilities in righttowork states caterpillar opened these new facilities in clayton and

caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of

were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by

states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for

caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal
