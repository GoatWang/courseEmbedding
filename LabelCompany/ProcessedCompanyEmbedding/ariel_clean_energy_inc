accounting principles applicable to a going concern this contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business currently the company does not have material assets nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs and allow it to continue as a going concern the company has an accumulated deficit of  the

assurance that the company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue in existence accordingly these factors raise

q to the company ariel clean energy “ariel” we us or our are to ariel clean energy inc   general overview   we are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business in certain instances a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge we have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements   we may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities to develop a new product or service or for other corporate purposes we may acquire assets and establish whollyowned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity we may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity we may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business upon the consummation of a transaction it is likely that our present management will no longer retain a majority control of our company in addition it is likely that as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction one or more new officers and directors would join our company   we anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success we believe that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered corporation business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want we can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities   we have not yet entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate business opportunity or acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue a transaction if an appropriate opportunity is identified        table of contents   currently we do not have a source of revenue we are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations historically we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through loans from a company controlled by our management but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise additional funds privately we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we locate a prospective business opportunity through which we can pursue our plan of operation further we expect that any new acquisition or business opportunities that may become available to our company will require additional financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation if our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds our business may fail if we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail   results of operations   during the three months ended march   we incurred operating expenses of  compared to operating expenses of  incurred during the three months ended march   with  increase in operating expense primarily for maintaining reporting status with the securities and exchange commission and  increase in interest expense accrued from amount due to related party       three months ended march                      changes

liabilities                     working capital deficiency                  our working capital deficiency increased by  as of march   from december    this was driven by the increase in amounts due to a related party for paying the company’s operating expenses   cash flows   cash flow from operating activities   net cash used in operating activities was nil for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   we had a net loss of  which was increased by a change in prepaid expenses of  and reduced by  for increase in accounts payable and  for increase in amounts due to a related party during the three months ended march   we had a net loss of  which was increased by a change in prepaid expenses of  and reduced by  for increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and  for increase in amounts due to a related party   cash flow from investing activities   we did not use any cash in investing activities for the three months ended march   and         table of contents   cash flow from financing activities   we did not have any cash provided from financing activities for the three months ended march   and    limited operating history need for additional capital   there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance  we are a development stage corporation and have not generated sufficient revenues from operations to fully implement our business plan  we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations  our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and competition from larger organizations  we will require equity andor debt financing to provide for the capital required to implement our plans we will require additional funds to operate for the next year   we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations   capital resources   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of march     off balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors   as of march   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as guarantees retained or contingent interest in assets transferred obligation under a derivative instrument and obligation arising out of or a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity   going concern   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended december   this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain sufficient debt or equity financing to fund our operating expenses this is because we have not commenced planned principal operations  we have no actual or potential revenue source there is no assurance we will ever reach this point our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern   the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing or acquiring a new business and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations in that new business the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders it is not probable we would be able to obtaining traditional loans from financial institutions because we have no business operations no assets and no revenues   there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through private placements bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements to the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements public offerings andor bank financing are insufficient we will have to raise additional working capital no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or if available will be on terms acceptable to us  we have been reliant on our majority shareholder to provide financial contributions and services to keep the company operating  we currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions        table of contents   critical accounting policies   we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material we have identified below the critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position results of operations and cash flows    due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  on a regular basis we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   as a “smaller reporting company” we are not required to provide the information required by this item   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of march   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  management is dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive and financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of march     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        table of contents   part ii
