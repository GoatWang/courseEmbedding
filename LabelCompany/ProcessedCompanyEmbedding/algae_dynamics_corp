development collaborating with universities of waterloo  western ontario in rd strategy to capture market share of nonsmoke mmj products for mmj patients who don’t want to take up smoking algae dynamics corp otcqb adynf is developing nonsmoking delivery systems for cannabinoids the company aims to produce new formulations of algae and cannabis oils that deliver health benefits without the attendant dangers that result from smoking smoking is a killer statistics published by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimate that ‘cigarette smoking kills more than  americans each year with more than  of these deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke’ httpdtnfmdkhx smoking–related illness costs the us economy ‘more than  billion a year including nearly  billion in direct medical care for adults and  billion in lost productivity’ yet tobacco use is a preventable cause of death and disease which the  percent of the population who smoke can avoid and many would do so if they are presented with nonsmoking ways to use tobacco or cannabis luckily there is more than one way to skin the cannabis cat for not only can it be smoked but it can be vaporized and its oil can be extracted or tinctures may be made from it smoking is undoubtedly a common method of delivery the simplest way of using cannabis is burning and smoking the female inflorescence the flowers and buds of female plants contain the highest concentrations of cannabinoids while male flowers contain much less leaves of both genders contain cannabinoids and may be mixed with the inflorescence to be smoked extracts from the plant are also processed to produce hashish for example which tends to be smoked as well cannabis is sometimes heated to produce a vapor that can be inhaled or the inflorescence may be immersed in a solvent such as alcohol to produce a tincture rich in cannabinoids the algae dynamics corp way however is the extraction of the oils from cannabis in december  the company announced a new oil extraction initiative in the canadian cannabis industry httpdtnfmzbsh it plans to deploy its existing extraction technology of algae oil to cannabis to supplement this initiative adynf is expanding its research and product development rd partnerships with canadian academia planning to sign supply service and sales agreements with existing access to cannabis for medical purposes regulations acmpr licensed producers and the company plans to submit an application to become a producer and seller of medical marijuana under the acmpr the cannabis oil extraction industry is expected to hit c billion by  this exponential growth will in part be propelled by a desire for cannabinoid delivery methods that do not involve smoking a study by mackie research capital found that  percent of dried marijuana users in colorado state would eventually convert to marijuana extracts and oils if that is indicative of cannabis use generally then adynf’s safer delivery methodology is soon likely to be very much in demand for more information visit the company’s website at wwwalgaedynamicscom let us hear your thoughts algae dynamics corp message board about qualitystocks

cannabis biotech market next article qualitystocksnewsbreaks – orhub inc orhb announces exercise price for series b and d warrants algae dynamics corp adynf is “one to watch” june   algae dynamics corp otcqb adynf is focused on developing proprietary research and products involving botanical oils derived from cannabis and algae the original core of the company’s product development strategy was the extraction of omega fatty acids from certain strains of algae with high concentrations of dha to create various nutraceutical products as a result of the many demonstrated health benefits of other botanical oils most notably cannabis oil algae dynamics developed a strategy aimed at developing products that combined the health benefits of algae and cannabis oils capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for cannabis oil and other smokefree alternatives to marijuana consumption will help support ongoing initiatives to create and market researchdriven product formulations although the company is publicly traded in the us business is conducted in canada with no exposure to us federal regulation involving cannabis the canadian cannabis oil extraction marketplace is projected to grow from c million in  to c billion in  which is more than a fold increase with the government of canada indicating a target date for full legalization on or before july  numerous opportunities for sales in extracts and oils will open up very soon using colorado as a comparable example a study performed by mackie research capital found that  of dried marijuana users in the state would eventually convert to marijuana extracts and oils this is because most consumers taking cannabis for medical purposes are increasingly looking for delivery systems that do not involve smoking marijuana the market’s attractiveness can be further realized when considering that the canada’s licensed producer marketplace is far less competitive with  current licensed producers for the whole country vs  licensed cultivators in colorado collaborating with prominent canadian universities is a core part of the algae dynamics’ plan to bolster cannabis extraction expertise develop premium products and add to its portfolio of intellectual property through its agreements with the university of waterloo and the university of western ontario the company is focusing primarily on the use of extracts from cannabis oil and algae oil in the context of cancer as well as the development of new pharmacotherapies for mental health nearterm goals include expanding research and development work with existing and new canadian universities securing supplyservice agreements with licensed producers and submitting an application to health canada to become a licensed producer of medical marijuana and ultimately have a license to sell products derived from cannabinoids algae dynamics also owns a proprietary technology for the cultivation of low cost highly pure algae biomass which will be developed as a vertical integration strategy in the future to support the need to source algae oil for researchdriven product formulations the management team leading these initiatives has nearly a century of beneficial experience spanning from management and process experience to successful fund raising and commercialization as part of its key objective to be the  research canadian cannabis oil researchdriven product formulator the company has also formed a strong team of scientific and strategic advisors that complement ongoing rd relationships and initiatives individuals who support the company’s initiatives include dr jonathan blay phd frsb fibms csci cbiol who performs research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of colorectum pancreas breast and prostate cancers and dr steven laviolette bsc phd who performs research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of depression posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and schizophrenia with such a strong foundation laid in the areas being pursued algae dynamics is well positioned to execute on its carefully developed business plan to fasttrack to revenue growth
