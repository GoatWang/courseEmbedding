defendants united states district court d minnesota january   attorneys appearing for the case christopher w madel and k craig wildfang  robins kaplan miller  ciresi llp  lasalle plaza  lasalle avenue minneapolis mn  for plaintiff jeff i ross  ross  orenstein llc  south ninth street suite  minneapolis mn  for defendant memorandum opinion and order transfering venue john r tunheim district judge the question before the court is whether exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed in minnesota while the same parties are currently involved in litigation in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia after a venue change is proper the court ordered the parties to submit simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issues of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure a compulsory counter claims and the doctrine of abstention as outlined in colorado river water conservation dist v united states  us    see also mo ex rel nixon v prudential health care plan inc  fd   th cir  both parties have responded for the reasons set forth below the court transfers venue to the northern district of georgia background the defendants in this litigation collectively noteholders were plaintiffs in an earlier action brought in the district of minnesota against compucredit holdings corporation compucredit who is the plaintiff in this action akanthos capital mgmt llc et al v compucredit holdings corp case no cv d minn dec   hereinafter the georgia litigation in that litigation compucredit moved for a transfer of venue under  usc § a citing expense and the convenience of the parties the court granted the request for a change of venue to the northern district of georgia within weeks of the transfer compucredit filed suit in minnesota alleging antitrust violations the minnesota litigation docket no  the allegations in the minnesota litigation are closely related to the issues in the georgia litigation for example noteholders complaint in the georgia litigation alleges that on december   compucredit announced a plan to give away  million and spin off a profitable subsidiary primarily to insiders compl ¶  docket no  this announcement resulted in a dramatic drop in the trading prices of compucredit notes after the drop in prices compucredit initiated a tender offer for the notes at the lower prices noteholders boycotted this tender offer which is a key fact in compucredits antitrust claims in the minnesota litigation id noteholders initiated the georgia litigation to try to protect the value of their shares and were required to enter into settlement negotiations with compucredit portions of which are now a part of the allegations of conspiracy in the minnesota litigation id ¶ discussion a district court should    consider abstaining from exercising jurisdiction in a case where a parallel    lawsuit is pending the court may raise the issue of the appropriateness of abstention sua sponte cincinnati indem co v a  k const co  fd   th cir  discussing abstention in a case involving parallel federal and state claims internal citations omitted courts in other jurisdictions have similarly noted that federal courts should avoid duplicitous litigation ongoing in other federal courts particularly when potentially compulsory counterclaims are involved natl equip rental ltd v fowler  fd   d cir  further  usc § a the general transfer provision provides for the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought in analyzing a motion to transfer under § a a district court employs a threefactor balancing test that considers  the convenience of the parties  the convenience of the witnesses and  the interests of justice terra intl inc v miss chem corp  fd   th cir  these factors are not exclusive and a district courts decision on a motion to transfer requires a casebycase evaluation of the particular circumstances at hand and a consideration of all relevant factors id ultimately a district court enjoys much discretion when deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer id at  see also cent regl emps benefit fund v smithkline beecham corp no   wl  at  d minn aug   in the instant case the court finds that the relevant factors to the decision to transfer venue are whether the issues raised in the minnesota litigation could be considered compulsory counterclaims and whether the colorado river doctrine of abstention is implicated i venue considerations in the georgia litigation the court found that venue transfer was warranted primarily for the expense and convenience of the parties regarding the first factor of the balancing test the court noted that all of the parties are corporations more than twothirds of whom have no ties to minnesota at all hrg on mot to change venue at  docket no  akanthos capital mgmt llc et al no cv d minn mar   further noteholders claimed compucredit was insolvent so the court found that none of the parties would be served by the increased expense of litigating in minnesota as opposed to georgia where compucredit is located id at  regarding the second factor the court also noted that the primary witnesses in the case were located in georgia and that no fact witnesses were located in minnesota id at  finally on the third factor the court noted the considerations for evaluating the interests of justice are the relative familiarity of the two courts with the law to be applied the relative ability of the parties to bear the expenses of litigating in a distant forum judicial economy the plaintiffs choice of forum obstacles to a fair trial and each partys ability to enforce a judgment id at  citing graff v qwest commcns corp  fsuppd   d minn  the court determined the last consideration was not relevant and the others either carried no weight or were equally balanced with the exception of the ability to bear the costs of the litigation id at  again the court cited compucredits potential insolvency as determinative on this point id the court finds that the earlier determination on these three factors is applicable to the instant litigation since the parties are the same and the issues to be litigated revolve around the same factual scenarios the court notes that the instant litigation presents further issues related to judicial economy and the interests of justice that support a transfer of venue that were not present in the georgia litigation the potential of compulsory counterclaims and colorado river concerns of duplicative litigation ii compulsory counterclaims while a claim that could be a compulsory counterclaim in a different litigation does not necessarily make venue improper courts have noted that when there undoubtedly are judicial economy and preclusion issues involved    the availability of a counterclaim in another court is a factor to consider in determining whether to transfer the case pursuant to  usc § a jomico llc v traxys n am llc no   wl  at  ed okla june   emphasis omitted without determining precisely if claims were compulsory counterclaims other courts have transferred cases to districts with pending litigation in part because even if the cases are not ultimately consolidated having the matters resolved in the same forum will increase the probability of consistent results neb beef ltd v advanced food co inc no cv  wl  at  d neb july   see also avaya inc v mitel networks corp  fsuppd   ed va  the federal rules of civil procedure state a pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that — at the time of its service — the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim a arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing partys claim and b does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction fed r civ p a the allegations in the minnesota litigation are factually intertwined with the claims asserted in the georgia litigation indeed one portion of the instant motion concerns settlement negotiations that occurred in the georgia litigation prior to the venue transfer the eighth circuit applies the logical relation test to determine if a counterclaim is mandatory tullos v parks  fd   th cir  under that test compulsory counterclaims may comprehend a series of many occurrences depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship id citing moore v n y cotton exch  us    under this test the allegations in this complaint are logically related to those in the georgia litigation since they are the reactions of two parties to each others actions around the sale of the notes at issue in this manner the two lawsuits are intrinsically intertwined the court declines to determine whether the claims in the minnesota litigation are actually compulsory counterclaims — this determination properly belongs with the court hearing the underlying claims however the court finds that the probability that the minnesota claims are compulsory in the georgia litigation weighs in favor of transferring venue in the interests of justice iii colorado river the supreme court has noted that when an action in federal court is closely related to an action already pending in state court prudential factors should be considered when deciding whether to exercise federal jurisdiction colo river  us at  the principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is even stronger with regard to parallel proceedings in two federal courts id at  see also mo ex rel nixon  fd at  when faced with duplicative litigation a court has at its disposal a variety of mechanisms    to deal with this issue such as venue transfer     mastro v momot no   wl  at  d ariz july   see also haworth inc v herman miller inc  fsupp   nd ga  where exceptional circumstances grounded on considerations of wise judicial administration giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation exist a district court may decline to review a case where proper jurisdiction exists or transfer the case to a more appropriate venue internal quotation marks omitted citing colorado river  us at  given identical parties and the similarity of issues presented in the instant case the court finds that the colorado river principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is a relevant factor in the interests of justice weighing in favor of venue transfer in sum the court determines that the convenience of the parties and witnesses weighs in favor of venue transfer further for the interests of justice the purpose of judicial economy and to avoid potentially duplicitous proceedings with contradictory outcomes the court transfers venue for the instant case to united states district court for the northern district of georgia through its discretionary power under  usc § a order based on the above considerations it is hereby ordered that this case is transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia footnotes  under section a a court must first determine whether the action might have been brought in the proposed transferee district however given that the minnesota district court previously reached this conclusion with regard to the same parties and over intrinsically similar factual allegations this court does not repeat this analysis hrg on mot to change venue akanthos capital mgmt llc et al case no cv d minn mar   comment your name your email

awkward and factually prolix memorandum opinion reserves outstanding motions to dismiss in favor of consideration of motions for partial summary judgment which appeared to offer lowhanging fruit which if reaped at the outset might avoid significant litigation effort the two issues so addressed involve the standard of care in the governing limited liability company agreement and the effect of a release agreement entered by the principal of the main plaintiff here on that entity’s ability to proceed with its claims plucking that fruit has proved more difficult than i anticipated and whether its elimination from the menu of this litigation will shorten the meal remains to be seen with these issues resolved at any rate i encourage the parties to mediate this dispute litigation of which will no doubt involve much more unpalatable effort this action arises out of an alleged conspiracy to funnel valuable pharmaceutical interests away from an entity in which the plaintiff celestialrx llc “celestialrx” is a member the operative amended complaint brings sixteen different counts against over a dozen defendants the numerous defendants have banded together into five groups each group has moved to dismiss this action two groups have moved for partial summary judgment the parties have identified two preliminary issues which if decided could significantly clarify the legal issues in this action the first is whether a july   release the “release agreement” bars causes of action brought by celestialrx that accrued prior to the release the  second is the extent to which the limited liability company agreement the “llc agreement” and a july   amendment to that agreement “amendment no ” limit or modify fiduciary duties this memorandum opinion addresses those preliminary issues because these two preliminary issues were raised by defendants’ motions for partial summary judgment i will address them under that standard i am reserving decision on the outstanding motions to dismiss and will ask for further guidance from the parties in light of my decisions below on these two preliminary legal issues i undertake this unusual procedure in the interest of efficiency i background this action involves a tangled web of pharmaceutical transactions licensing and sales agreements among various related entities thus this case’s background is dense the following provides a detailed but nonexhaustive overview of the context of this dispute sufficient to understand this court’s analysis of the two legal issues addressed interpretation of the july   release agreement and interpretation of certain dutyrelated provisions in the llc agreement and amendment no  a heavier focus is given to the prejuly   events as such context is helpful to understand the documents executed that day there are substantial disputes in this  except where otherwise noted the information in this section is undisputed and taken from the verified pleadings affidavits and other evidence submitted to the court reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party—the plaintiffs here  litigation arising after july   because of the nature of this memorandum opinion those are discussed with less detail the casual reader may be satisfied with the brief summary below this action arises from allegedly improper selfdealing transactions by two members of a threemember limited liability company the company akrimax pharmaceuticals llc “akrimax” or the “company” is a defendant in this action along with the two alleged wrongdoers—joseph j krivulka and leonard mazur the third member of akrimax is itself a limited liability company and brings this action challenging such transactions on various grounds that third member plaintiff celestialrx is wholly owned by a nonparty steve laumas akrimax is a pharmaceutical business and engaged in a morass of licensing and sales agreements underlying this dispute the plaintiffs allege that krivulka improperly inserted various entities that he controlled or was invested in the “middlemen entities” as middlemen between akrimax and other drug companies from whom akrimax sought to receive drug rights the middlemen entities received a cut of the sales or marketing performed by akrimax the favorability of the terms under which the middlemen entities were interposed between the company and third parties is heavily disputed in the spring of  krivulka and his entities notified akrimax of their intention to terminate akrimax’s rights to sell and distribute certain drugs  allegedly this was the first time celestialrx and laumas learned of the middlemen entities’ existence and dealings with akrimax and laumas thereafter began investigating—and disputing the propriety of—krivulka’s actions ultimately a “settlement” was reached whereby the middlemen entities agreed that akrimax would retain certain drug rights in exchange for paying additional fees among other concessions in connection with the settlement laumas but according to the plaintiffs not celestialrx released all claims against krivulka and mazur these higher fees ultimately were not paid allegedly as part of a scheme by krivulka to damage akrimax and akrimax eventually lost the rights returned to it via the settlement celestialrx brings this action alleging misconduct by krivulka and others for almost every transaction between krivulka’s related entities and akrimax a parties  the plaintiffs plaintiff celestialrx is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in old greenwich connecticut celestialrx’s sole member

akrimax  the krivulka defendants’ spin on the vote is that it fundamentally changed akrimax as a company the defendants argue akrimax “transitioned from an entity receiving revenues based on manufacturing” and revenue streams from its initial inderal purchase in  “to an entity earning revenues marketing and selling pharmaceuticals under rights acquired by other entities” see id at §

demonstrate the “absence of a material factual dispute” if the moving party satisfies its initial burden then “the burden shifts to the nonmovant to present some specific admissible evidence that there is a genuine issue of fact for a trial” at this point the nonmoving party may not simply rest on their pleadings but must point to conflicting evidence in the record that creates a genuine dispute of material fact in reviewing a motion for summary judgment the facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom “must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party” however the

enrique v state farm mut auto ins co  ad   del  citation omitted  id citation omitted   iii analysis in analyzing the defendants’ motions for partial summary judgment each of which requires me to construe a contract i am guided by our case law discussing when summary judgment is appropriate in such a context generally “when the issue before the court involves the interpretation of a contract summary judgment is appropriate only if the contract in question is unambiguous”  our supreme court has explained that this court has long upheld awards of summary judgment in contract disputes where the language at issue is clear and unambiguous in such cases the parol evidence rule bars the admission of evidence from outside the contracts four corners to vary or contradict that unambiguous language but where reasonable minds could differ as to the contracts meaning a factual dispute results and the factfinder must consider admissible extrinsic evidence in those cases summary judgment is improper specifically the supreme court has indicated that “in a dispute over the proper interpretation of a contract summary judgment may not be awarded if the language is ambiguous and the moving party has failed to offer uncontested evidence as to the proper interpretation” i note this same standard applies to the construction of a  united rentals inc v ram holdings inc  ad   del ch  gmg

the llc agreement will proceed in light of this standard a the release agreement the defendants seek partial summary judgment that the plaintiff celestialrx has released all claims existing as of the date of execution of the release agreement the defendants argue that the release agreement signed by laumas individually “is general and broad in scope” and released claims predating july   including a count for fraudulent inducement now brought in the present action by laumas’ wholly owned entity celestialrx the plaintiffs argue that the release agreement is clear that only laumas’ individual claims were released and that celestialrx and krittika were not parties to the agreement and thus it is not enforceable against them further the plaintiffs allege the agreement was fraudulently induced and therefore not enforceable under new york law because in re nextmedia invrs llc  wl  at  del ch may   “in a dispute requiring interpretation of a contract summary judgment is appropriate

neutral precept of contract interpretation is that agreements are construed in accord with the parties intent and that the best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing” “thus a written agreement that is complete clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms” under new york law “ambiguity in a contract arises when the contract read as a whole fails to disclose its purpose and the parties intent     or when specific language is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations” courts applying new york law have recognized that “a contract is ambiguous when it could suggest multiple meanings to a reasonable objective reader familiar with the context of the contract    the court should take into account both the language of the contract and the inferences that can be drawn from that language” similarly  eakins aff ex  §  innophos inc v rhodia sa  nyd   ny  quoting greenfield v philles records

unreasonable or contrary to the reasonable expectations of the parties” however “extrinsic evidence of the parties intent may be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous which is an issue of law for the courts to decide” in broyhill furniture industries inc v hudson furniture galleries llc the new york appellate division explained interpretation of a release under new york law as follows as with contracts generally the courts must look to the language of a release—the words used by the parties—to determine their intent resorting to extrinsic evidence only when the court concludes as a matter of law that the contract is ambiguous    the scope of a general release depends on the controversy being settled and the purpose for which the release is actually given     however if from the recitals therein or otherwise it appears that the release is to be limited to only particular claims demands or obligations the instrument will be operative as to those matters alone regarding

recitals in a contract cannot grant rights extending beyond those particularly described in the agreement they may be useful in construing the rights and obligations created by the agreement” thus under new york law a recital may be helpful in interpreting the scope of a release but it cannot create a substantive right beyond the express operative terms of the agreement with this guidance i turn to an analysis of the release agreement’s terms  who released what the release agreement was executed on july   as part of akrimax’s reorganization and settlement the release agreement in its introduction defines the term parties to mean steve laumas leonard mazur and joseph krivulka the “parties” i note that celestialrx is not included as a “party” the recitals to the release agreement indicate that “the parties directly or indirectly own one hundred percent  of the outstanding membership interests of akrimax pharmaceuticals llc a delaware limited liability company the ‘company’”

or in any way connected to any actions taken by the parties in connection with the company the “release of claims” subheading of the agreement quoted above defines releasing parties and released parties but it also uses terms previously defined in either the recitals the company or in the introduction the parties the release agreement provides at a subheading titled “ entire agreement” that this is a ‘fully integrated’ agreement this agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter and all prior oral or written agreements contracts negotiations representations and discussions if any pertaining to this matter and the parties hereto are merged into this agreement no party to this agreement has made any oral or written representation other than those set forth in this agreement and no party has relied upon or is entering into this agreement in reliance upon any representation other than those set forth in this agreement the release agreement was signed over each individual parties’ name the issue before the court on the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment is whether celestialrx is barred from bringing claims for prejuly   conduct by the release “parties” is a defined contractual term specified to mean mazur laumas and krivulka the releasing parties—those releasing their claims—are defined as “the  id at §

present and future agents officers directors shareholders members partners partnerships employees representatives attorneys estates vendors owners parents subsidiaries affiliates successors and assigns” i find the language of the release agreement clear celestialrx is a released party but not a releasing party as those terms are explicitly described therefore the plaintiff here celestialrx did not release claims existing as of july   the defendants point out that the recitals to the contract express that laumas along with the other named parties is an owner direct or indirect of akrimax and that the named parties expressed the desire to settle all claims “known and unknown among themselves” they argue that this precatory language is inconsistent with  id at §  id emphasis added i note that “affiliates” is an undefined contractual term but its ordinary meaning would presumably include celestialrx and krittika  while it does not inform my decision here based on the unambiguous language of the release agreement i note that the signature block of the release agreement was signed over laumas’ own name with no reference to celestialrx whereas other documents executed on july

claims by laumas but not his entity celestialrx the direct member of akrimax it is not clear to me that the intent expressed by the language of the recitals is inconsistent with the contractual release in any event to the extent the defendants are correct it is unhelpful to them under new york law the recitals can be employed to help to interpret an ambiguous contract or limit the scope of an agreement but not to vary the terms where no ambiguity exists or expand the scope of an operative section the individual parties to the release entered a contract that explicitly defined releasing parties more narrowly than released parties celestialrx is included in the latter not the former the defendants argue vehemently that the intention of the parties at the time they entered the release agreement as reflected in the record is contrary to this express language they point to much of the record evidence recited in the background section of this memorandum opinion highlighting the dispute over the middlemen entities that had arisen among the akrimax principals and argue that in light of that dispute and in light of the drafting history it would be nonsensical and contrary to all parties’ subjective intent to have excluded celestialrx from the release perhaps so the argument may raise issues of reformation but that issue is neither before me on the current motion nor generally susceptible to summary judgment accordingly the  see grand manor health related facility inc v hamilton equities inc  nysd   ny app div  rsl commcns plc v bildirici  wl  at  sdny mar    defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment that celestialrx has released claims existing as of july   is denied b duties under the llc agreement the second prong of defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment seeks a judicial determination that akrimax’s llc agreement together with amendment no  thereto “eliminated fiduciary duties” additionally defendants seek partial summary judgment that “sections  and  of the llc agreement provide the applicable contractual burden of proof andor persuasion for conflict transactions” thus the defendants seek a determination that even if amendment

transactions that displaced whatever remaining fiduciary duty might otherwise apply”  the defendants’ assert that their position presents “two paths” to the same result these provisions are analyzed

litigation or settlement decisions going forward the discussion below defines only duties applicable to the defendants after july    amendment no  resolving the issues stated above requires interpretation of the fiduciary duties provided by akrimax’s llc agreement specifically the parties dispute the meaning of the language in section h which was added by amendment no  on july   contemporaneously with the release agreement discussed above under the delaware limited liability company act “llc act” our courts have implied fiduciary duties to managers of an llc unless contractually waived this approach has been embodied in the llc act itself in other words the intention of the parties to the agreement that fiduciary duties apply to managers is implied where that agreement does not provide otherwise the llc act is explicitly contractarian however and permits the elimination of some or all fiduciary duties for members managers or others through a provision in an llc agreement  i note that delaware law applies to the interpretation of amendment no  and the llc agreement see eakins aff ex  ¶  eakins aff ex  §   see kelly v blum  wl  at  n del ch feb

equity including the rules of law and equity relating to fiduciary duties and the law merchant shall govern”  “provided that the limited liability company agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing” similarly in the context of construing llc agreements this court has recognized that although fiduciary duties may be disclaimed agreements drafters must do so clearly and should not be incentivized to obfuscate or surprise investors by ambiguously stripping away the protections investors would ordinarily receive” thus this court has consistently found that removal of a manager’s default fiduciary duties from an llc agreement must be clear and unambiguous the parties dispute the extent to which amendment no ’s language removes modifies or alters fiduciary duties owed by members managers and officers of akrimax the battleground in this dispute centers around whether the following language completely removes fiduciary duties—or removes fiduciary duties except for subparts i and ii notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement neither the manager nor any of the members of the board of directors nor any member shall have any fiduciary duties to the company or the members or shall be personally liable to the company or its members for a breach of any duty that does not involve i an act or omission not

to waive or amend any restriction on competition confidentiality disclosure solicitation or other activities which may be governed by applicable law or included in an employment agreement confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement or any other contract between the company and any member or manager which restrictions shall in all such matters control a section  this section eschews the corporate opportunity doctrine and permits conflicted interests to be held by directors and members unless provided otherwise by separate contract the requirements under which conflicted transactions are permitted are set out in the safeharbor provisions of section  discussed below b section  the safe harbor of section a exists where a conflicted transaction involving the company and its members or “any indemnified party”—a defined term that includes officers and affiliates—is  entered in the absence of bad faith and  the “manager” before july   collectively mazur krivulka and laumas thereafter krivulka determines—in good faith—that the transaction is  id at §  see id at article i defining “indemnified parties” stating it “shall mean the manager the directors any affiliate of the directors and each officer of the company and their respective successors and assigns each in their capacity as such”   “fair and reasonable to the company” in such case the conflicted party bears no liability to the “company or to any other person” arising from the transaction section b as i read it provides an alternative safe harbor with respect to conflicted transactions as defined in section a the terms of which are limited to those “fair and reasonable to the company or any member” the conflicted party who seeks a safe harbor under subsection b is charged with “resolving such conflict” by “considering    the relative interest of each party including its own interest to such    transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests any customary or acceptable industry practices and gaap” where the conflicted party has acted in good faith and makes the required resolution of the conflict by a goodfaith balancing of the factors above he is insulated from liability since he is deemed not in “breach of this agreement    or of any duty or obligation    at law or in equity    ” conflicted transactions not achieving one of these safe harbors are by contrast transactions from which the party may be shown to have derived an improper personal benefit under section hii in breach of his duty under that section the parties do not contend that the safe harbor of section a applies here therefore the defendants will be found not to have breached a duty under section  id at § a id at § b  id   hii and are insulated from liability under section b where the conflicted transaction was  entered in good faith and  where the particular defendant subjectively determined that the transaction was fair and reasonable to the company and members after the required goodfaith balancing of interests that is the standard against which the challenged transactions entered on or after july   shall be evaluated this specific contractual standard applies to all indemnified parties as defined in the llc agreement i note that good faith—a subjective standard applies separately to both the transaction and to the conflicted party’s analysis of whether it is “fair and reasonable” i do however note that the subjective good faith standard here must be read consistently with the purpose of sections  and  which is to permit conflicted transactions in certain circumstances  our supreme court when faced with an undefined good faith or bad faith provision in an alternative entity situation has employed the following standard “an action ‘so far beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment that it seems essentially inexplicable on any ground other than bad faith’” dv realty advisors llc v policemens annuity  ben fund of chicago  ad   del  quoting brinckerhoff v enbridge energy co  ad   del   see zahler aff ex  at article i § b  see related westpac llc v jer snowmass llc  wl  at  del ch july   explaining that when parties to an alternative entity “cover a particular subject in an express manner their contractual choice governs and cannot be supplanted by the application of inconsistent fiduciary duty principles that might otherwise apply as a default”  iv conclusion for the forgoing reasons the defendants’ motions for partial summary judgment are granted in part and denied in part specifically the prong of the motion regarding the release is denied the prong of the motion interpreting fiduciary duties owed by the governing documents is resolved consistent with the discussion above the parties should confer regarding the

above two of the defendants are secregistered investment advisors none of the defendants is a secregistered reporting company  defendants compete against one another with respect to the purchase and sale of compucredit’s convertible senior notes jurisdiction and venue  this court possesses jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to  usc §§    and  usc §§      among other things defendants’ conspiracy as well as their buying and selling of compucredit’s convertible senior notes has affected and currently affects a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   venue is appropriately laid in this judicial district pursuant to  usc § b a substantial part of the events giving rise to this case arose in the district of minnesota the akanthos lawsuit was filed by defendants in the district of minnesota and three hearings were held in minnesota the law firm that was the agent of defendants and acted at their direction at all times pertinent to this action has its principal place of business in the district of minnesota and sent the purported “settlement” offer from defendants to compucredit from the district of minnesota facts  beginning not later than sometime in december  defendants agreed to coerce compucredit to repurchase its convertible senior notes from each defendant at inflated abovemarket prices i compucredit’s convertible senior notes and the indentures  defendants claim to own approximately  of compucredit’s outstanding convertible senior notes collectively the “notes” which were issued by compucredit in two series a  convertible notes due in the year  pursuant to and governed by an indenture dated may   the “ notes” and b  convertible senior notes due in the year  pursuant to and governed by an indenture dated november   the “ notes” the holders of the  notes may require the company to repurchase some or all of their notes in  the  notes have no similar provision the notes were originally issued pursuant to private placements    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   each indenture sets forth the rights of the noteholders as is customary with convertible notes the noteholders negotiated for the right to convert their notes into common stock in lieu of the financial covenants that might restrict or require noteholder approval of certain transactions consequently there are no covenants prohibiting the payment of dividends or spinoff transactions in fact the indentures expressly contemplate a variety of corporate transactions and provide for adjustments to the conversion rate when they occur ii compucredit’s dividend and defendants’ original demand  in a december   press release compucredit announced “a dividend of  per share payable to holders of record as of the close of trading on december  ” totaling approximately  million in the same press release compucredit also announced that it was “considering a taxfree spinoff of its us and uk microloan businesses into a publiclytraded company” emphasis added this press release made clear that the proposed spinoff had not yet been approved by compucredit’s board of directors in accordance with the indentures written notice of the dividend was provided to the indenture trustee us bank national association  in a december   letter defendants complained to compucredit about the dividend and the contemplated spinoff among other things defendants demanded that compucredit retract its thenplanned dividend    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   however as later events have now made clear defendants followed this strategy as part and parcel of a conspiracy to coerce compucredit to buy defendants’ notes at inflated abovemarket prices iii the akanthos lawsuit a  compucredit’s solvency in compucredit’s form q for the quarterly period ended september   filed november   compucredit reported equity in excess of  million and over  million in cash  in compucredit’s form k relating to the year  filed march   compucredit reported equity in excess of  million and over  million in cash  compucredit has never missed a single interest payment with respect to the  notes or the  notes  b compucredit has paid and is paying its debts as they come due defendants’ first complaint  defendants filed the akanthos lawsuit on december   along with a motion for temporary restraining order preliminary injunction and expedited discovery defendants sought to enjoin the dividend as well as the contemplated but not yet approved spinoff defendants falsely alleged that both the distribution and the spinoff were fraudulent transfers because among other things compucredit was allegedly “insolvent”    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   defendants’ first complaint contained two counts a a claim under the uniform fraudulent transfers act “ufta” and b a claim under the georgia corporate code  in defendants’ first complaint defendants did not seek damages in any form  in defendants’ first complaint defendants did not ask the court to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at any price  the defendants’ decision not to ask the court to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes illustrates that the defendants filed the akanthos lawsuit for the improper purpose of coercing compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes rather than for the legitimate purpose of seeking judicial relief c the december   tro hearing  on december   after a hearing on the merits of defendants’ motion for a temporary restraining order this court denied defendants’ request to enjoin compucredit’s distribution to shareholders as well as defendants’ request for expedited discovery accordingly compucredit made the dividend payment to shareholders on december    as part of his order denying the defendants’ requested preliminary injunctive relief the honorable james m rosenbaum for the united states district court of minnesota specifically found that compucredit was not insolvent but third and in its way the most profoundly troubling to the court is the claim that the corporation is insolvent it is not insolvent the plaintiffs advance the affidavit of an accountant who is an accounting expert a cpa    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  who says it is insolvent on a proforma basis a pro forma is a set of assumptions that are made about events in the view of the person who advances it and if you add and subtract the numbers mr mcdonough thinks need to be added and subtracted you could extract i guess the fact that the corporation is insolvent on the other hand there’s no indication whatsoever that there is an accepted methodology for applying to a regular and ongoing corporation his set of proforma assumptions in a fashion which shows that this court ought to step in into what is otherwise a functioning marketplace and substitute its judgment for that of the board of directors    but at this point there is precious little other than his own ad hominem belief in the validity of his own opinions that this company is somehow insolvent transcript of proceedings dec   at  emphasis added d compucredit’s possible spinoff  on january   a form  was filed with the sec regarding purpose financial holdings inc “purpose financial” purpose financial is compucredit’s microloan business that could be subject to the possible “spinoff” transaction if the spinoff occurs compucredit shareholders will receive shares in purpose financial the sec approval process is a necessary preliminary step that must be completed before compucredit’s board of directors can consider approving the spinoff e defendants’ amended complaint  on january   compucredit filed a motion to dismiss the first complaint after this motion was filed defendants voluntarily dismissed count ii of their first complaint ie the count relating to the alleged violation of the georgia corporate code    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   on february   defendants filed their amended complaint in their amended complaint defendants asserted a single cause of action claiming that the dividend and the possible spinoff violated the ufta  the focus of the amended complaint is the possible spinoff of purpose financial however recognizing that the original claim to enjoin the payment to shareholders was now moot defendants inserted a naked and unsupported claim for damages related to the dividend specifically defendants seek  million ie the same amount as the december   dividend as damages  in defendants’ amended complaint defendants have not asked the court to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at any price  defendants’ amended complaint is equally baseless as their first complaint defendants do not believe—nor would any reasonable litigant believe—that compucredit’s publiclyannounced and contemplated spinoff constitutes a fraudulent transfer because among other things defendants know that compucredit is not insolvent  the damages claim included in defendants’ amended complaint is baseless neither minnesota nor georgia’s ufta permits a damages claim against the transferordebtor ie compucredit moreover defendants know—as any reasonable litigant would know—that they have not suffered any monetary losses as a result of the conduct that they challenge because as noted above and as judge rosenbaum found compucredit is not insolvent    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  iv defendants’ conspiracy to boycott compucredit’s january  offer to repurchase its notes a defendants suggest that compucredit use its cash to repurchase compucredit’s notes at discounted prices  at the december   hearing relating to defendants’ motion for a temporary restraining order defendants’ counsel argued that compucredit should not use its cash to declare a dividend but should instead use its cash to repurchase its bonds at discounted prices  for example at the december   hearing defendants’ counsel stated a “a good strategy would be to take any cash and buy back their debt buy back these notes at deeply discounted prices” transcript of proceedings dec   at  “they could get huge reductions—  percent” id at  b compucredit’s january  offer to repurchase its notes b  on january   defendants’ counsel filed a sworn declaration stating that “   counsel for the compucredit informed me that compucredit sic was interested in purchasing holders’ notes and that holders should speak directly with company management on that topic later that day and subsequently i was contacted by several note holders sic both clients and non clients who informed me that the company offered to buy their notes at current market prices”  on january   compucredit made an offer to repurchase up to  million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes the prices that    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  compucredit offered to pay in this offer were either equal to or slightly above then existing market prices  pursuant to the january   offer compucredit recently repurchased  million in aggregate face amount of the  and  notes approximately  and  of the outstanding principal amount of the notes respectively for an aggregate total cost of  million compucredit repurchased the  notes for  per  principal amount of such notes for a total cost of  the  notes were repurchased at a price of  per  principal amount of such notes for a total cost of  excluding accrued interest and fees and other expenses in connection with the january   offer the notes were repurchased for an aggregate total cost of  upon information and belief those that accepted compucredit’s january   offer are sophisticated parties with knowledge of the fair value of compucredit’s notes  none of the defendants tendered their notes to compucredit pursuant to compucredit’s january   offer  on information and belief defendants agreed among themselves to refrain from tendering their notes to compucredit pursuant to compucredit’s january   offer c  defendants’ boycott of the january   offer and collusive demand on compucredit harmed competition there exists a relevant market the product dimension of which is compucredit notes and the geographic dimension of which is the united states    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   compucredit’s notes are unique among other things they could be converted into compucredit’s common stock and from compucredit’s perspective there is no reasonable substitute for compucredit’s notes because the repurchase or redemption of its own notes is the only means by which compucredit can extinguish this debt prior to maturity  compucredit cannot repurchase its notes from any source other than compucredit noteholders  defendants have market power in the market for compucredit notes as they claim to hold approximately  of the notes  defendants’ boycott of the january   offer and their collusive demand that compucredit repurchase their notes at par harms competition by inflating the price at which compucredit and others can purchase compucredit’s notes v defendants made false statements as part of their conspiracy to coerce compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at inflated abovemarket prices  after failing in federal court defendants began seeking nonjudicial routes to coerce compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at inflated abovemarket prices specifically as part of their conspiracy defendants proceeded to make and publish several false outofcourt statements regarding compucredit’s alleged insolvency and breaches of the indentures  by advancing the belowdescribed communications defendants acted against the unilateral and individual economic interests to promote their pricefixing and bidrigging conspiracy indeed unless a conspiracy exists defendants have no incentive    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  to make communications that compucredit is insolvent or breached the indentures indeed such communications would logically decrease compucredit bond prices and thus harm defendants’ economic selfinterests but for the same reasons that defendants’ statements are against their own economic selfinterests defendants know that their communications will harm compucredit and therefore pressure it to bring the akanthos lawsuit to an end by any means possible including purchasing defendants’ notes at inflated prices thus by advancing the belowdescribed communications defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic interests to promote their pricefixing and bidrigging conspiracy  defendants’ belowdescribed communications are acts in furtherance of their conspiracy to coerce compucredit to pay inflated abovemarket prices for its convertible senior notes these joint communications further demonstrated the concerted nature of defendants’ actions and the existence of an agreement combination and conspiracy in restraint to trade a  the january   bdo letter almost one month after the us district court for the district of minnesota specifically found that compucredit was solvent on january   defendants’ counsel sent a letter to compucredit’s auditor bdo seidman llp “bdo letter”  the bdo letter attached a copy of defendants’ alleged expert report from edward m mcdonough “mcdonough report” by sending mcdonough’s report to bdo among other ways defendants adopted the statements contained therein as true    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   the bdo letter quoted mr mcdonough and falsely concluded that the “ability of compucredit to continue as a going concern” was “uncertain”  moreover the bdo letter falsely stated that “compucredit’s ability to continue as a going concern is not merely uncertain but is subject to ‘substantial doubt’” citing sas   defendants’ communications to bdo seidman would logically decrease the prices of compucredit’s convertible senior notes by making said communications therefore defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic selfinterests absent the conspiracy alleged herein defendants would not have made these communications to bdo seidman b  the february   sec letter by letter dated february   defendants wrote the securities and exchange commission “sec letter” and made similar false statements as in the bdo letter  in the sec letter defendants falsely stated “compucredit is already insolvent”  the sec letter was sent approximately  days after the us district court for the district of minnesota specifically found that compucredit was solvent  the defendants did not inform the sec of this finding by the us district court for the district of minnesota  defendants’ communications to the sec would logically decrease the prices of compucredit’s convertible senior notes by making said communications    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  therefore defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic selfinterests absent the conspiracy alleged herein defendants would not have made these communications to the sec c defendants’ communications to us bank  as stated above us bank national association “us bank” is the indenture trustee for the notes purchased by defendants  in court defendants contended that compucredit did not the breach indentures were “irrelevant” indentures and that the in court defendants contended that compucredit had not breached the  indentures and that the indentures were irrelevant to the akanthos lawsuit  for example at the december   hearing before judge rosenbaum defendants’ counsel stated that “this is not an indenture case” and that “we’re not here saying that that contract ie the indenture has been breached at this point in time” transcript of proceedings dec   at    in addition on march   defendants’ counsel stated that “the indenture is absolutely irrelevant to this case and to the issues which are before your honor” transcript of proceedings mar   at  out of court defendants contended that compucredit breached the indentures   according to us bank defendants communicated at least two times with us bank in late early     case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   these communications with us bank included false statements regarding compucredit’s alleged breaches of the indentures specifically and according to a march   letter sent by us bank to compucredit “us bank letter” defendants falsely communicated to us bank that compucredit “is violating the indentures and intends to do so in the future”  us bank noted that these communications were made in the form of “very vocal allegations by noteholders”  defendants’ communications to us bank would logically decrease the prices of compucredit’s convertible senior notes by making said communications therefore defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic selfinterests absent the conspiracy alleged herein defendants would not have made these communications to us bank vi defendants demand that compucredit repurchase defendants’ notes at par  on march   compucredit and defendants participated in a discovery conference in the akanthos lawsuit  on march   defendants’ counsel made the following demand on compucredit in anticipation of tomorrow’s pretrial conference plaintiffs hereby demand par with respect to their entire holdings of each of the two series of compucredit notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest as of the date of tender we look forward to your response    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   in early march  compucredit’s  notes traded at approximately  of par  in early march  compucredit’s  notes traded at approximately  of par  again defendants never sought relief to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at any price in their first complaint or amended complaint in the akanthos lawsuit let alone at par  no law permitted or permits defendants to seek relief to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at any price indeed if such law existed defendants would have alleged it in the akanthos lawsuit defendants’ march   demand therefore has no reasonable relation to the akanthos lawsuit  defendants’ agreement to refuse to sell the notes at anything other than inflated prices continues to this day vii defendants’ continued purchases of compucredit’s notes  if defendants truly believed—as they have contended in and out of court— that compucredit was insolvent they would not continue to purchase compucredit’s notes  on or about march   david kay on behalf of defendant tenor telephoned compucredit’s treasurer william r mccamey  during this march  telephone call kay told compucredit’s treasurer among other things the following    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  a the “group” ie defendants had recently purchased compucredit’s notes b defendants increased their purchases of compucredit’s notes after the december   hearing regarding defendants’ motion for a temporary restraining order specifically kay stated that defendants increased their stake in compucredit’s  notes and as a result of this increased stake they owned more than  of compucredit’s  notes c when a company such as compucredit engages in a offer to repurchase notes it is traditional to first establish the price of the offer with the largest noteholders prior to the tender d defendants agreed as a group not to participate in compucredit’s january   offer because the offered price according to defendants was too low and e defendants would sell their notes to compucredit between  of par which was a premium to the recent market trades and defendants thought that that was an appropriate reference price  on march   kay spoke to compucredit’s treasurer again during this call kay repeated the statements described in the immediatelypreceding paragraph  pursuant to defendants’ coordinated efforts another defendant represented to compucredit that it possessed a document containing the amount of notes held by all    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  defendants and that defendants now collectively owned over  of compucredit’s  notes  there is no legitimate procompetitive reason for defendants to possess information regarding the quantity of compucredit’s notes owned by other defendants  currently compucredit has approximately  of  notes outstanding therefore according to certain of the defendants defendants now own approximately  of compucredit’s  notes and approximately  of compucredit’s  notes and  notes combined viii defendants know the akanthos lawsuit is a sham  the akanthos lawsuit was filed and is maintained as a part of defendants’ conspiracy to coerce compucredit to pay inflated abovemarket prices for defendants’ notes  defendants’ march   demand demonstrates that defendants knew and know that the akanthos lawsuit was and is a sham objectively baseless and filed for the improper purpose of obtaining supracompetitive prices for their notes because among other things a defendants could not and did not seek relief to compel compucredit to repurchase defendants’ notes at any price b defendants thereafter demanded that compucredit repurchase their notes at full price c defendants know that compucredit has never missed a payment with respect to its convertible senior notes d defendants know that compucredit has over  million in equity as of december   and e if defendants truly believed that compucredit was or is    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  becoming insolvent as they represented in and out of court they would not have continued to purchase compucredit’s bonds  in light of the facts that defendants knew when they filed their two akanthos complaints no reasonable litigant could believe that the akanthos lawsuit would succeed  the defendants are not pursuing the akanthos lawsuit based upon an actual desire to secure judicial relief rather they are using it as a means of coercing compucredit to pay inflated abovemarket prices for the notes violation of the sherman act  usc §  count i  compucredit incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein  defendants entered into contracts combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade which continue to this day in violation of section  of the sherman act  usc §   the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies consist of agreements among the defendants to inflate compucredit’s bond prices to boycott compucredit’s january   tender offer and future tender offers and instead jointly demand that compucredit repurchase defendants’ notes at par  each of the defendants had actual knowledge of and knowingly participated in the contracts combinations and conspiracies described herein    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies alleged herein unreasonably restrain trade in the market for compucredit notes in that they have the effect of inflating the price at which compucredit can extinguish its debt by purchasing these notes  the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies alleged herein have harmed and continue to harm compucredit in its business or property  the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies described herein are likely to continue unless enjoined  compucredit has been injured and is currently threatened with injury by reason of the anticompetitive agreement and actions taken by the defendants in violation of section  of the sherman act  compucredit’s notes are unique to compucredit compucredit cannot purchase reasonablysubstitutable notes from any other person  moreover and due to among other things the part of defendants’ conspiracy that requires them to publish false statements regarding compucredit monetary damages are inadequate to remedy the harm that plaintiff compucredit has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the contracts combinations and conspiracies described herein  defendants’ agreement includes an agreement not to sell the notes at market prices and only to sell the notes at inflated abovemarket prices resulting from their conspiracy and accordingly is illegal per se    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of   plaintiff compucredit therefore requests that this court issue an order pursuant to  usc § a and fed r civ p  that the contracts combinations and conspiracies described herein violate section  of the sherman act  usc §  violation of the sherman act  usc §  count ii  compucredit incorporates by reference the following paragraphs as if fully set forth herein  except e       and  in the alternative to count i compucredit does not incorporate any allegation that the akanthos lawsuit is a sham in this count ii  defendants entered into contracts combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade which continue to this day in violation of section  of the sherman act  usc §   as described in the march  and other communications alleged herein defendants agreed and conspired to artificially inflate the price of compucredit’s bonds  defendants’ agreement is not only shown via their admissions in the march  and other communications alleged herein but it is also demonstrated by among other things a defendants’ actions against their individual economic interests including without limitation the bdo letter and defendants’ communications with us bank b defendants’ continued purchasing of compucredit’s notes after alleging that compucredit is or was to become insolvent and    case cvjrtjjk document  filed  page  of  c defendants’ boycott of the january   compucredit tender offer and future tender offers  each of the defendants had actual knowledge of and knowingly participated in the conspiracy described herein  the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies alleged herein unreasonably restrain trade

conspiracies alleged herein have harmed and continue to harm compucredit in its business or property  the unlawful contracts combinations and conspiracies described herein are likely to continue

compucredit respectfully requests that this court   enter a judgment declaring that defendants violated  usc §  order each defendant to tender any and all of compucredit’s  notes and  notes in its
