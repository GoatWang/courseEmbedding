international inc and subsidiaries key business metricswe evaluate our restaurants and assess our business based on the following operating metricssystemwide sales growth refers to the change in sales at all companyowned and franchise restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year comparable sales growth refers to the change in restaurant sales in one period from the same prior year period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer companyowned restaurants refranchised during a quarterly period are included with franchise restaurants for the purpose of calculating comparable sales growth for the quarter comparable sales and sales growth are measured on a constant currency basis which means that results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year monthly average exchange rates we analyze key operating metrics on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends without distortion from the effects of currency movementssystemwide sales represent sales at all companyowned restaurants and franchise restaurants we do not record franchise sales as revenues however our franchise revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise saleskey business metrics by brand market  three months ended june   key business
