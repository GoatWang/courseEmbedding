them item a risk factors as used in this item a references to we us and our mean the fund an investment in our units and our investments in local limited partnerships and their operating partnerships are subject to risks these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our units and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners if any on liquidation of our investments in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited the irs may audit us or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing tax credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our units changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our units andor the value of the operating partnerships until the local limited partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year low income housing tax credit compliance period investors are at risk for potential recapture of low income housing tax credits that have already been claimed the low income housing tax credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for unit holders noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future low income housing tax credits and the fractional recapture of low income housing tax credits already taken in most cases the annual amount of low income housing tax credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the persons last  of taxable income the local limited partnerships may be unable to sell the operating partnerships at a price which would result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction accordingly we may be unable to distribute any cash to its investors low income housing tax credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our units  table of contents poor performance of one housing complex or the real estate market generally could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years of the existence of the fund the loss of any remaining future low income housing tax credits a fractional recapture of previously claimed low income housing tax credits and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur to the extent the operating partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks      difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of operating partnerships        limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships        limitations on removal of local general partners        limitations on subsidy programs and        possible changes in applicable regulations the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar properties and neighborhood conditions among others no trading market for the units exists or is expected to develop there is currently no active trading market for the units accordingly limited partners may be unable to sell their units or may have to sell units at a discount limited partners should consider their units to be a longterm investment investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of certificates      upon the sales or other taxable disposition of certificates investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the nonrecourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes together with the money they receive from the sale of the certificates is greater than the original cost of their certificates this realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits it is possible that the sale of certificates may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale investors may have tax liability in excess of cash      investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash boston capital distributes to them under these circumstances unless an investor has passive losses or credits to reduce such tax liability the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution from boston capital similarly in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of certificates an investor may be allocated taxable income resulting in tax liability in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event  table of contents investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold      there is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex the price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale distributed to boston capital expenses such as accrued fund management fees and unpaid loans to boston associates will be deducted pursuant to section a of the fund agreement included in exhibit a if any of these events happen investors will not get all of their investment back and the only benefit from an investment in boston capital will the tax credits received the sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors      the necessity of obtaining the consent of the operating general partners        the necessity of obtaining the approval of any governmental agencyies providing government assistance to the apartment complex and        the uncertainty of the market any sale may occur well after the fifteenyear federal housing tax credit compliance period we have insufficient sources of cash to pay its existing liabilities we currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy its financial liabilities furthermore we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term however there can be no assurance that this will be the case we would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of its inability to satisfy these obligations all monies currently deposited or that will be deposited in the future into the partnerships working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities item b unresolved staff comments not applicable item  properties the fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in
