july   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states on a going concern basis nature of operations as a result of the companys management having experience in the brewing business the company has acquired the rights to broken  which is a craft beer brewed in the province of quebec canada  the company is engaged principally in the marketing of broken  and is contracting all brewing and distribution activities to a thirdparty service provider  we operate in a single segment which is the craft beer market  our craft beer consists of single brand known as broken  and is currently brewed distributed and marketed solely in quebec canada  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited interim reporting in the opinion of management the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments consisting of normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the financial position of brisset beer international inc and the results of its operations for the periods presented  this report on form q should be read in conjunction with the companys financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys form k for the fiscal year ended may    the company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context  accordingly footnote disclosure which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the companys form k for the fiscal year ended may   has been omitted  the results of operations for the sixmonth period ended november   are not necessary indicative of results for the fiscal year ending may   or for any future annual or interim period note  – ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business  the company commenced its craft brewing activities in september   during the six months ended november   the company has incurred net losses of  and the company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern   we will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew distribute and market our broken  brand of craft beer  our current operations have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from february  through november  we are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner we currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all the inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations and may require us to suspend our operations which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock  after auditing our may   financial statements our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital if we are unable to obtain necessary financing we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew distribute and market our craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable  management may seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock  although there are no assurances that managements plans will be realized management believes that the company will be able to continue operations in the future  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited note  – summary of significant accounting policies managements estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and notes significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate to accrued liabilities and the impairment of goodwill  management believes the estimates utilized in preparing these financial statements are reasonable and prudent and are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions the company may undertake in the future actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash

foreign hedging arrangements the company maintains all of its cash balances with two financial institutions in the form of demand deposits loss per share income or loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the companys warrants are antidilutive diluted income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method which uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and also includes the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding and warrants at november   potential common shares of    related to outstanding share purchase warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be antidilutive  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited note  – summary of significant accounting

prepaid expenses and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value hierarchy under gaap distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entitys own assumptions unobservable inputs the hierarchy consists of three levels          •  level one  — quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         •  level two  — inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and         •  level three  — unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use determining which category an asset or liability falls

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated  the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet in accordance with asc  intangibles – goodwill and other the company performs a qualitative assessment at the end of each reporting period

and the jurisdiction was changed from florida to nevada  the changes became effective at the close of business on july   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states on a going concern basis nature of operations as a result of the companys management having experience in the brewing business the company has acquired the rights to broken  which is a craft beer brewed in the province of quebec canada  the company is engaged principally in the marketing of broken  and is contracting all brewing and distribution activities to a thirdparty service provider  we operate in a single segment which is the craft beer market  our craft beer consists of single brand known as broken  and is currently brewed distributed and marketed solely in quebec canada  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited interim reporting in the opinion of management the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments consisting of normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the financial position of brisset beer international inc and the results of its operations for the periods presented  this report on form q should be read in conjunction with the companys financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys form k for the fiscal year ended may    the company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context  accordingly footnote disclosure which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the companys form k for the fiscal year ended may   has been omitted  the results of operations for the three month period ended august   are not necessary indicative of results for the fiscal year ending may   or for any future annual or interim period note  – ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business  the company commenced its craft brewing activities in september   during the three months ended august   the company has incurred net losses of  and the company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern   we will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew distribute and market our broken  brand of craft beer  our current operations have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from february  through august  we are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner we currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all the inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations and may require us to suspend our operations which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock  after auditing our may   financial statements our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital if we are unable to obtain necessary financing we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew distribute and market our craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable  management may seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock  although there are no assurances that managements plans will be realized management believes that the company will be able to continue operations in the future  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  unaudited note  – summary of significant accounting policies managements estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and notes significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate to accrued liabilities and the impairment of goodwill  management believes the estimates utilized in preparing these financial statements are reasonable and prudent and are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions the company may undertake in the future actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes foreign currency the functional currency of the company at august   and may   is the canadian dollar transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured into the functional currency at the current exchange rate on the date of the transaction any foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently remeasured at current exchange rates with gains or losses recognized as foreign exchange losses or gains in the statement of operations nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period exchange gains and losses are included in statement of operations for the period adjustments arising from the translation of the companys financial statements to united states dollars for presentation purposes due to differences between average rates and balance sheet rates are recorded in other comprehensive income concentration of credit risk the company has no offbalancesheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements the company maintains all of its cash balances with two financial institutions in the form of demand deposits loss per share income or loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the companys warrants are antidilutive diluted income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method which uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and also includes the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding and warrants at august   potential common shares of    related to outstanding share purchase warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be antidilutive  brisset beer international inc notes to condensed consolidated

instruments the fair value hierarchy under gaap distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entitys own assumptions unobservable inputs the hierarchy consists of three levels      •  level one  — quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   •  level two  — inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and   •  level three  — unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant

intangibles—goodwill and other which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment the company tests for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year if impairment exists a writedown to

reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated  the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet in accordance with asc  intangibles – goodwill and other the company performs a qualitative assessment at the end of each reporting period to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate

festivals  during the three months ended august   compared to  for the three months ended august   net loss for the three months ended august   our net loss was  compared to  for the three months ended august    operating expenses total operating expenses for the three months ended august   were  compared to  for the three months ended august    the increase in operating expenses in the three months ended august   compared to the three months ended august   was primarily due to the hiring of a full time marketing employee and an increase to stephan pilons employment agreement  operating expenses in the three months ended august   were comprised of advertising and promotion of     no commissions    management fee of     travel of     miscellaneous of     and wages and benefits of        office and sundry expenses were  for the three months ended august   compared to  for the three months ended august    professional fees were  in the three months ended august   compared to  for the threemonths ended august    the company paid  in management and director fees during the three months ended august   compared to  during the same period in  liquidity and capital resources we had a cash balance of  and a negative working capital of  at august    net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended august   was  compared to  during the three months ended august    a portion of the fluctuation was due to an increase of the net loss for the three months ended august   to  from  for the three months ended august    in addition in the three months ended august   we had an inflow in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  compared to a net inflow of  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the three months ended august    there was a net inflow in related parties in the three months ended august   of  compared to a net outflow of  for the same period in   in the three months ended august   there was an outflow of  in changes in accounts receivable compared to an outflow of  for the same period in   there were no financing activities during the three months ended august   as the proceeds for the issuance of  units of common stock was not received until after august    in the three months ended august    was received from the issuance of  units of common stock  there were no investing activities for the three months ended august   and august   between august  and august  the company has raised a total of  through the issuance of shares of common stock which shares were offered by the company pursuant to an exemption from registration under regulation s of the securities act of  as amended  the funds received from these financings were used primarily to fund the companys portion of drill programs under the farmout agreement and for general working capital purposes  however even with these financings current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund all of the companys requirements for the next twelve months we believe that we will need approximately  to fund our operations for the next  months  we may seek to raise additional funding that we require in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock  however we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations  we currently do not have any agreements or arrangements in place for any future financing   going concern consideration the company has realized only limited revenue from its oil and gas operations and has since abandoned those interests and is currently focusing on developing a craft brewing business    during the three months ended august   the company incurred a net loss of   since inception on may   the company has an accumulated deficit of  to august    these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern  we will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew distribute and market our broken brand of craft beer  our current operations to date have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from may  through august  we are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner we currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all the inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations and may require us to suspend our operations which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock  after auditing our may   financial statements our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital if we are unable to obtain necessary financing we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew distribute and market craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements item   quantitative
