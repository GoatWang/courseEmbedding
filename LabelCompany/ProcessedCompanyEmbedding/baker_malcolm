has been very weak over the past  years in the united states returns on highrisk stocks have cumulatively fallen short of the returns on lowrisk stocks during a period when the equity market as a whole experienced high returns relative to treasury bills in the spirit of fischer black’s  article “beta and return” published in this journal the author takes seriously the idea that this evidence reflects a risk anomaly—a mispricing of risk for behavioral and institutional reasons—and revisits the associated implications for investing and corporate finance examining asset allocation high leverage in financial firms low leverage in industrial firms private equity venture capital and bank capital regulation along the way many of these implications fit nicely with black’s original conjectures and the author highlights refinements and additions to the original list keywords asset allocation equity investment behavioral finance private equity format print find at harvard citation

equity issues and the attribution of past returns malcolm baker and yuhai xuan there is a strong link between measures of stock market performance such as changes in tobins q or past stock returns and equity issues typically this performance is thought to be a characteristic of the firm not the ceo who happens to run the firm in contrast to this conventional wisdom we find that equity issues depend on changes in q and returns to a greater extent if the current ceo was at the helm when those past returns were realized what we label the ceospecific q and past return explains equity issuance but it does not explain debt issuance investment or profitability two discontinuity analyses show that the specific share price that the current ceo inherited is an important reference point while salient share prices prior to turnover are not a corollary is that a firm with poor stock market performance cannot or will not raise new capital unless the current ceo is replaced keywords performance
