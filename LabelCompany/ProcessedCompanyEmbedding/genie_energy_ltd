legal challenge to the ny pscs december order on january   the ny psc granted an industry request to delay implementation of the order until may   to allow time for judicial review the ny psc has also undertaken a broader examination of the role played by reps in retail energy markets which may result in additional restrictions on rep operations in new york state  in february  the ny psc issued an order barring reps from serving any customer unless their price was equal to or below the incumbent utility providers price except where the offering met certain renewable energy requirements in july  a new york court struck down key provisions of that february order  afek subsequent to the close of the quarter in april of this year afek spudded its sixth exploratory well ness  which is the first

determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap genie energy also disclosed for the first quarter of  as well as for comparable periods adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap genie energys measure of adjusted ebitda consists of gross profit less selling general and administrative expense research and development expense exploration expense and equity in the net loss of amso llc plus depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation which are included in selling general and administrative expense another way of calculating adjusted ebitda is to start with income loss from operations and add depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and other operating loss net management believes that genie energys adjusted ebitda provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of genie energys or the relevant segments core operating results management uses adjusted ebitda among other measures as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making in addition management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance in relation to genie energys competitors disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking in addition genie energy has historically reported adjusted ebitda and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time management refers to adjusted ebitda as well as the gaap measures gross profit income loss from operations and net income loss on a segment andor consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments and genie energys historical operating results in making operating decisions for budget and planning purposes and to form the basis upon which management is compensated although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under gaap they primarily represent the noncash current period allocation of costs associated with longlived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods while genie energys oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive genie energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future genie energys operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance stockbased compensation recognized by genie energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under gaap stockbased compensation is excluded from genie energys calculation of adjusted ebitda because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of genie energys core business with the results of other companies however stockbased compensation will continue to be a significant expense for genie energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees compensation that impacts their performance other operating loss net was incurred from drilling and related operations for the mei golan water cooperative a water cooperative of agricultural settlements in the golan heights since this was a nonroutine event and drilling for water is not part of genie energys or the relevant segments core operations the loss was excluded from adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to gross profit income loss from operations cash flow from operating activities net income loss basic and diluted earnings loss per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition genie energys measurements of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies following is the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure which is income loss from operations for genie energys reportable segments and net income loss for genie energy on a consolidated basis

before genie retail energy – new york regulatory updatein december  the new york state public service commission ny psc issued an order prohibiting retail energy providers from serving customers enrolled in new yorks utility lowincome assistance programs lowincome customers throughout new york state  the december order largely replicated a ny psc order issued in july of  that was subsequently stayed by a ruling of a new york court on procedural grounds  the rep industry has filed a legal challenge to the ny pscs december order on january   the ny psc granted an industry request to delay implementation of the order until may   to allow time for judicial review the ny psc has also undertaken a broader examination of the role played by reps in retail energy markets which may result in additional restrictions on rep operations in new york state  in july  a new york court struck down key provisions of a ny psc order barring reps from serving any customer unless their price was equal to or below the incumbent utility providers price except where the offering met certain renewable energy requirements  afek in april  the israeli ministry of energy and water awarded genie energys afek oil and gas subsidiary an exclusive threeyear petroleum exploration license covering  square kilometers in the southern portion of the golan heights in northern israel the license has now been extended through april  afek has completed drilling five exploratory wells in the southern portion of its license area  analysis of the results confirms the presence of a consistent and substantial resource of earlystage maturated organics primarily bitumen and heavy oil afek is preparing to drill a sixth exploratory well ness  which will be the first well located north of the sheikhali fault  reprocessed seismic and other data indicate that the source rock that contained the resource in the southern portion of the license area extends north of the fault but at significantly greater depths than in the southern portion  the planned drilling at ness  seeks to confirm the presence of organics at the site and to determine whether the geological conditions necessary to convert earlystage maturated organics to light crude are present also in israel genie energys newly formed drilling services subsidiary atid drilling is proceeding to purchase the rig utilized to drill afeks exploratory

full year  and  in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap genie energy also disclosed for the full year and fourth quarter of  as well as for comparable periods adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap genie energys measure of adjusted ebitda consists of gross profit less selling general and administrative expense research and development expense exploration expense and equity in the net loss of amso llc plus depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation which are included in selling general and administrative expense another way of calculating adjusted ebitda is to start with loss income from operations add depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and the writeoff of capitalized exploration costs and deduct the gain from the consolidation of amso llc management believes that genie energys adjusted ebitda provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of genie energys or the relevant segments core operating results management uses adjusted ebitda among other measures as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making in addition management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance in relation to genie energys competitors disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking in addition genie energy has historically reported adjusted ebitda and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time management refers to adjusted ebitda as well as the gaap measures gross profit loss income from operations and net loss income on a segment andor consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments and genie energys historical operating results in making operating decisions for budget and planning purposes and to form the basis upon which management is compensated although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under gaap they primarily represent the noncash current period allocation of costs associated with longlived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods while genie energys oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive genie energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future genie energys operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance stockbased compensation recognized by genie energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under gaap stockbased compensation is excluded from genie energys calculation of adjusted ebitda because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of genie energys core business with the results of other companies however stockbased compensation will continue to be a significant expense for genie energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees compensation that impacts their performance the writeoff of capitalized exploration costs which is a component of loss income from operations is also excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda the writeoff of capitalized exploration costs is primarily dictated by events and circumstances outside the control of management that trigger an impairment analysis while there may be similar charges in other periods the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of genie energys continuing operations the gain from the consolidation of amso llc which is a component of loss income from operations is excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda genie energys equity in the net loss of amso llc was included in adjusted ebitda because it was the result of ongoing operations of amso llc the gain from the consolidation of amso llc was a nonroutine result of totals withdrawal from amso llc the gain is not part of genie energys or the relevant segments core operating results adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to gross profit income loss from operations cash flow from operating activities net income loss basic and diluted earnings loss per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition genie energys measurements of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies following is the

quality of subsequent testing and ongoing exploration activities without yielding hydrocarbons demonstrative of a commercially viable resourcepreliminary results from the analysis conducted to date are consistent with afeks initial model for the basin and suggest that there may be large resources of gas additionally robust amounts of light liquid hydrocarbons may be concentrated in regional

with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap genie energy also disclosed for the first quarter of  as well as for comparable periods adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaapgenie energys measure of adjusted ebitda consists of gross profit less selling general and administrative expense research and development expense exploration expense and equity in the net loss of amso llc plus depreciation and stockbased compensation which are included in selling general and administrative expense another way of calculating adjusted ebitda is to start with income loss from operations and add depreciation and stockbased compensationmanagement believes that genie energys adjusted ebitda provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of genie energys or the relevant segments core operating results management uses adjusted ebitda among other measures as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making in addition management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance in relation to genie energys competitors disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking in addition genie energy has historically reported adjusted ebitda and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this timemanagement refers to adjusted ebitda as well as the gaap measures gross profit income loss from operations and net income loss on a segment andor consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments and genie energys historical operating results in making operating decisions for budget and planning purposes and to form the basis upon which management is compensatedalthough depreciation is considered an operating cost under gaap it primarily represents the noncash current period allocation of costs associated with longlived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods while genie energys oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive genie energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future genie energys operating results exclusive of depreciation is therefore a useful indicator of its current performancestockbased compensation recognized by genie energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under gaap stockbased compensation is excluded from genie energys calculation of adjusted ebitda because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of genie energys core business with the results of other companies however stockbased compensation will continue to be a significant expense for genie energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees compensation that impacts their performanceadjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to gross profit income loss from operations cash flow from operating activities net income loss basic and diluted earnings loss per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition genie energys measurements of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companiesfollowing is the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure which is
