software and our warmth and appreciation for one anothers skills set  comments reworking the modern paragraph   comments   the shift from printed page to mobile screen presents fascinating challenges for writers and designers a printed page is fixed and can be designed with some confidence that the reader will experience the text in order from top to bottom in a mobile reading experience like the gadget software vpub™ readers have control readers can choose a nearly infinite variety of pathways through the material how do you write and design content when you do not control the order in which a reader chooses to engage with iti have been wrestling with this question as an author in the process of developing a new textbook composed and designed specifically for the vpub™ platform one of the side effects of this experience has been a change in the way i think about and write paragraphswriting for the medium of print an author has a degree of control over the reader’s experience and can write paragraphs knowing that a reader will come upon them in a linear fashion for many years writers have been trained to organize paragraphs in a sequence one after another to develop an idea or build an argument we have been taught to write transitions to link paragraphs one to another in a kind of chain transitional phrases like “on the other hand” or “in contrast” are designed to be used as links in the chain clarifying for readers how one paragraph is connected to the previous paragraph mobile readers can choose their own pathways through the paragraphs—they not the author have control of the organization of the text in the visual representation here the conventional model of organizing paragraphs in print is on the left and on the right is an image of one of many possible paths a reader might take to read through a sequence of paragraphs in a vpub™the gadget software atomic reading structure ars model combines linear and nonlinear reading strategies authors can organize content in a variety of ways defining a sequence or learning path that we imagine readers will follow my project for example is organized around three main units arranged in a roughly chronological order within each unit short scenes are presented in a sequence i designed to develop ideas and guide readers through the material readers certainly may choose to follow along with the path i have designed for them at the same time the vpub™ experience offers them other ways to move through the content they can choose a particular medium for example focusing on videos or on audio podcasts skipping past the textbased sections readers can also navigate content by focusing on historical figures or on key technologies we have defined several categories of content and readers can choose to focus on any one of those rather than following the main chronological path the physical form factor of the mobile devices readers use to interact with a vpub™ also shapes the way authors define and create content a typical mobile screen displays between  and  words at a time thus a paragraph composed on a desktop monitor may not look that long but once i have a chance to view it in the live preview i recognize that i need to shorten it or divide it into two or three smaller units being able to see my work in the live application has been an immense help in guiding me to define and shape smaller more modular units of contentas an author once i began to see how my paragraphs looked in the vpub™ i became aware of the number of explicit links i had built into them i quickly realized i could no longer begin a paragraph with “on the other hand” because i had no way of knowing what a reader would have just read so i began thinking about writing paragraphs that could stand completely on their own and that would make sense in any order as you can imagine this presents a challenge as well as an opportunity to reimagine the kind of work a paragraph might do​the basic concept of a paragraph as a unit of thought does not change in the vpub™ the paragraph becomes the primary unit of text each paragraph or “scene” is designed as a miniessay in itself what does change is the way i think about each paragraph instead of thinking in terms of links on a chain i imagine each paragraph as an episode or story in itself—selfcontained independent of what may come before or after in practical terms this means that i have to work to edit out any linking transitions at the beginning or end of each paragraph it also means that i aim to compose each paragraph so that it has a kind of narrative arc twist or surprise in short each paragraph has to do more work to inform and engage a reader because it cannot depend on its neighboring paragraphs for supporthere is an example of one of these “new paragraphs” written for the technology of the book few technologies have flourished for as long as the book even if we limit ourselves to printed as opposed to handwritten books we are left with a historical span of nearly  years how many other fifteenthcentury technologies remain in daily use today if you were to pick up an antique book a copy of the first folio for example—the first printed collection of shakespeare’s works published in —you would immediately recognize its form and you would be able to use it read it and enjoy it just as you would any modern book you might want to wear gloves to protect the priceless old pages but you would have no difficulty knowing how to open the book navigate its contents and read the text you would not need a tutorial or user’s guide because the technology and form factor of the first folio is for all practical purposes identical to any book you might find on a shelf today scanning the long history of the printed book it is the resilience and longevity of the book as a technology that is perhaps the most remarkable theme in the story in this example the paragraph builds toward the final reveal—that the story of the book is about persistence as opposed to change if the paragraph works it does so by creating a bit of tension or drama by quietly upending some of a reader’s expectationsin addition to changing the way i think about and compose paragraphs the ars model also provides other ways to develop and organize content most notably the platform makes available a wide range of reinforcing media authors can add images video and audio to help extend and clarify ideas presented in written text in the case of audio i record my own audio narration offering readers the option of reading listening or both further being able to add images and videos provides a way to anchor paragraphs in visual examples a map of medieval mainz germany for example can be presented as part of a discussion about gutenberg and his use of metalsmithing skills to develop the first successful movable type each paragraph of text is usually accompanied by at least one image one audio file and one video these new paragraphs thus evolve into fully developed learning modules in their own rightdoes writing paragraphs this way mean that the content is being fragmented or watered down not necessarily it does mean that as an author i have to be willing to give the reader more control a reader may design a way to connect and build ideas paragraph to paragraph that i might not have imagined that may be the hidden power of the new paragraph​in my case i will give readers even more control students using my technology of the book vpub™ will be invited to become contributors and authors in their own right students will research and compose case studies focusing on important historical figures technologies or events that are significant in the history of books and communication once edited and revised these case studies will be uploaded into the authoring console where they can be read by other students and readers around the world inviting students to become content cocreators is an exciting idea for me as a teacher in a course on the evolution of printing and publishing technology students will be able to experience the process of creation and authoring for themselves gaining firsthand experience with writing and designing content for readers using one of the most innovative new technologies available their handson exploration of a new approach to writing will go far beyond anything they might experience by reading a traditional textbook chapter ​  comments the evolution of mobile software towards deep functionality   comments   cosmetics and aesthetics continuing our discussion about mobile software in  i think about it in many different aspects as shown in the chart below in this installment i’d like to tackle cosmetics and aesthetics cosmetically and aesthetically mobile apps continue to be an emerging art form with trends that wax and wane and as to be expected in something as subjective as beauty no  people can agree on what looks good in the past few years the term “beautiful app” wedged its way into the broader discussion which of course creates even more opinions i’ve seen many of  what pundits call “beautiful apps” and while many may be attractive on the surface often they are either very difficult to use or its nearly impossible to actually find what you’re looking for in them i did a completely nonscientific bit of research here and looked at a number of “beautiful apps of the year” articles on many popular tech websites awards given from broader industry groups etc the usual suspects techcrunch business insider apple’s awards etc  out of respect for each developer and publisher i won’t specify what the apps are because i’m really more interested in the study and i never want to call out anyone who didn’t succeed you can look at all the beautiful app awards in the past few years and figure it out i eliminated a handful of apps that are published by giant companies like twitter yahoo facebook etc as they will likely get lots of attention anyway from their gigantic user bases  and even though i’m a huge gamer i also eliminated games from my nonscientific analysis as games have a very specific audience and an incredibly short half life anyway pun intended i wanted to focus on functional apps and see if there’s any relationship between “beauty” and success certainly in my own case clearly there is not the end sample set which is statistically a small sample ended up being a  total appsi looked at the app then went to their respective app stores and looked at how well they appeared to have done using app annie sensor tower and others read reviews looked at the date of the most recent reviews estimates on annual revenue etc i used a spreadsheet and some level of averaging to figure out if whether the software in general has succeeded which admittedly is fairly subjective review counts are interesting statistically i believe because if a customer actually invests their time to write something positive that is fantastic if lots of customers do it you’re doing amazing  we know that negative reviews seem to come easier than positivewhat i found ultimately didn’t surprise me out of  total apps that in the last  months were hailed as “beautiful” and “amazing” by all sorts of industry pundits   are either completely out of business or appear abandoned ie no updates in more than a year with the developer seeming to have moved on the remaining  had a variety of success across my twisted matrix of metrics four out of the remaining eight had very low download counts nearly no reviews  and nearly no estimated revenue two of these were actually acquired by larger companies interestingly the two that had pretty negative reviews and low review countsout of the four remaining apps three seem to be prospering  they have wonderful statistics from review counts downloads a continuous string of updates revenue projections and an enthusiastic following  the other one seems to be trucking along with a decent amount of activity but seriously low “projected revenue” which is derived from fees in app purchases etc so what did i learn from my completely unscientific analysis as to whether beautiful apps succeed  as the th century scottish philosopher david hume famously wrote in  ” beauty in things exists merely in the mind which contemplates them”  and as mobile software matures  becomes more purposeful and permeates more aspects of our lives what constitutes beauty will likely shift  beauty in software is clearly ephemeral  trends shift and with the ever increasing desire for more and more functionality in our pockets running on our mobile devices it’s clearly more important to balance design trends with practicality and usability as we cram more things into the limited real estate of our small screens  ​at some point i’m going to explore “absolute relevance” and how it might relate to true longevity in future mobile software  in my next post though we’ll focus on functionality and usefulness   comments intern spotlightjerome carter   comments   jerome joined the intern team while still in high school he had an interest in programming early on and felt right at home working

authoring   comment   for the past two years i have been exploring ways to make educational materials accessible to students on mobile phones in my online courses for example i have moved away from blackboard which is not well designed for mobile users much of my course content now lives instead on websites i have built with weebly or google sites these platforms provide responsive templates that work well for students on any size screen while grades administrative announcements and discussions still take place on blackboard which is institutionally mandated and required for ferpa compliance the majority of the text audio and video content for the courses is now housed on fully responsive sites outside of the lms students can access the course materials from their phones at any time without needing to log in to the cumbersome lms system more than half of my students now report that they do most of their course reading on their phonesbut what about textbooks most major textbook publishers now offer mobile apps with some degree of functionality for the most part however this is content that was not originally designed for mobile users the mobile ebook experience for most textbooks is not good and many students do not purchase required course texts as a result faced with this dilemma i wrote a taa blog post in may  about the challenge of making learning mobile “how educators and authors can make learning mobile” through a wonderful chain of events that blog post led to meeting a team of people at a new company called gadget software who have developed a publishing platform called vpub™ virtual publication specifically for students on mobile devicessince the fall of  i have been working with the folks at gadget software to develop a new product designed from the start for mobile users we are working together to take all of the materials for a course called “the technology of the book” and reimagine them specifically to take advantage of the vpub™ platform i can summarize that experience so far by saying that it has prompted me to rethink just about everything i know about composing and designing educational texts authoring for mobile is not simply a matter of breaking content into smaller units or using reflowable text to make long passages readable on a phone instead the process requires a deeper exploration of the reader experience a new approach to content development and a more deeply collaborative processreading on mobile devicesreaders on mobile devices generally want to direct their own reading experience following along a linear pathway through long passages of text as with traditional textbook chapters is not effective students increasingly want some control in defining their own learning path building their own process for reading text and engaging media so how do you compose and design educational texts when you do not have control over the order in which readers may approach specific sectionsthat question presented the first major design challenge for my work with gadget software our approach has been to give students several options in choosing how they want to work through the content students can choose to work through a traditional chapter menu or they can start with specific types of media listening to audio viewing videos based on their own situation and learning preferences or they can use an alternative contents to focus on technologies or case studies or key figures in fact we have begun to think in terms of a gamelike metaphor instead of chapters or units students embark on learning quests the outcome or goal is defined “explain the significance of the development of steampowered printing presses in the nineteenth century” for example but students have the option to choose how they want to work through the material toward that goala new approach to content developmenttraditionally textbooks are developed through a long process in which writing development revising and design are separate steps—often separated by months of time working on the technology of the book project with gadget software has been completely different in most cases as the author i am writing short units or sections of text at a time everything i write is also recorded by me as an audio podcast and in many cases the text is in turn converted into an animated video segment as well i post files in a shared folder that can also be accessed by my partners at gadget software—max riggsbee chief product officer and patricia alvarez product manager max and patricia take my raw files and import them into their authoring platform so we can see a live preview of how the content looks and behaves on a mobile phone this kind of rapid iteration and revision cycle has allowed us to rethink and redefine our approach as we go alongwe meet weekly to review new material and reflect on what we are seeing and learning as we build this rapid revision cycle is similar to the approach used by many software developers but it is a radically new process for textbook authors the advantage of this process is that it allows us to design and build as we go along rather than waiting nine months or more to write all the content firstcollaborationin some ways max and patricia play the role that a development editor would play in a traditional publishing scenario they provide feedback on the writing help to conceptualize the architecture of the product as a whole and so forth but it goes far deeper than that because they are actively building and designing in real time they are in effect cocreators design in textbooks has always been important but in a mobile process it is even more integral to the process of content development for them i am one of the first authors to work in this process to develop content specifically for their platform we have merged writing design and software engineering into a single workflowthe motivation for learning an entirely new process on a new platform is simple to provide students with learning materials and experiences that work for them it has become clear that retrofitting longform textbooks into mobile apps is only a shortterm solution working with my creative partners at gadget software we are forging a path toward what we hope will become the textbook of the future​michael will be copresenting a session at
