helpful newest oldest highest rating lowest rating sally k january   quick and easy this was extremely easy to make and i loved the fact that it was prepared in a single skillet i will add that i used the cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom just because i wasnt sure what the overall taste would be like i served this dish with a side of rice quick and easy meal was this helpful   cat may   great simple recipie i prepared this tonight and it was a big hit at my house i definitely will be making this again was this helpful   lagato april   definitely will try campbells never mentions their golden mushroom soup one would not believe the taste that adds to the simple tunanooclle casserole i would think it would also add much taste to this dish as well as any dish that uses a mushroom soup yes it is a bit more expensive but well worth the added taste was this helpful   kathii r april   um  um  good this was such an easy recipe to make i only made one change and that was the soup i am highly allergic to msg so  i used campbells healthy request cream of mushroom soup that is low sodium and has no msg that was the only change i really made except i added a bit more garlic  like  tablespoon of minced garlic was this helpful   carol april   mushroom soup substitution can cream if chicken soup or cream of celery soup be substituted was this helpful   your rating
