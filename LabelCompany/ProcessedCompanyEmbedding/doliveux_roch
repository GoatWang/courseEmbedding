approvalfda rejects romosozumabbiosimilars eat into jjs remicade sales interview with roch doliveux ucb why is patientcentricity placed at the heart of ucb jacky law asked ucb’s ceo to explain his company’s philosophy i really believe the industry is at an inflection point driven by patent expiries and a dramatic decrease in rd productivity that is compounded by external pressures on budgets pricing healthcare reforms and public opinion in the us for example this whole set of issues is putting huge pressure on the business model and every company has to find its own way of moving forward ageing populations are creating a new set of medical demands there are large unmet needs in diseases of the brain neurology disorders oncology and metabolic disorders none of which is being properly addressed today other dimensions to all of this concern the huge opportunities presented by the discovery of the genome and the new approach to the discovery of medicines that is emerging from that ucb has had to face this inflection point before other companies because we have been through most of our patent expiries already plus we have the advantage of a stable shareholder base as the company is familycontrolled which allows us to look for answers not only in the short term but also in the long term so what is our answer i am not saying this is the answer it may not apply to other companies but the ucb answer has been to learn from successful companies in consumerfacing industries our consumer is the patient and while there are some different characteristics such as the patient not always being the decision maker the patient is becoming increasingly informed by focusing on the patient you are also addressing genuine and severe unmet needs if you really focus on the patient this leads to a clear differentiation of your products so that they have impact on the most severe diseases and the biggest issues that patients have to overcome roch doliveux ucb on patient centricity in the pharmaceutical industry   everything derives from that patientcentricity is really nothing more than putting the patient at the heart of everything we do and i mean everything that we do nor do we call our customers patients they are people who live with severe diseases if we put people at the centre and do that well everything else follows if we address their medical needs if we help them and make a difference to their lives market share follows profits follow shareholder returns follow that is why we start with that also we had strengths to build on the notion of anchoring capabilities was already there companies are like people you build on your strengths and we had good fertile ground to move into patientcentricity this key driver of the new business model suits us patientcentricity manifests in everything we do from research to manufacturing to support functions to communication everyone and everything starts with patientcentricity the way we market our products how we allocate resources it is always with that in mind we ask how we can make a difference to the lives of patients it is not something we declared it is something that has built over time we stated this approach publicly for the first time when we joined forces with celltech in  and needed to clarify where we were going but it is a neverending process as long as there are patients suffering we need to find answers it is not just thinking about people in a charitable way we want to make a difference crohns and me ucb partners with patientslikemecom is one manifestation of our approach crohns advocates make a difference to peoples lives another example that shows how patientcentricity can function is the discovery of antisclerostin the discovery of antisclerostin started from a rare disease that occurs among a very small population of south africans they have a condition whereby they build bone they are a big and sturdy people who do not have bone fractures we looked at that population and identified the gene defect and the protein coded by that gene we then developed the antibody which can help people who lose bone we mimic the gene defect and apply reverse engineering to build quality bone the whole process started with people we didnt start with charts thinking through receptors or mapping genes we started with people when you think of apple being a great innovator or bmw in the car industry or cisco there is a pattern of always combining great technology and great customer intimacy we want to understand all aspects of people from their genes to their behaviours to knowing about the other diseases they suffer from and then understand how you bring that back into the research process it is embedded in our research thinking we bring people that deal with diseases into our labs but i would say it is more to foster a sense of urgency than to trigger the big turning point in the discovery of new treatments this is very different to the old approach take schizophrenia the old business model of pharma had been to find a drug by making rats schizophrenic i am a veterinary surgeon by background i dont remember schizophrenia being a big issue in rats the whole thinking forced the creation of an artificial disease but do rats display the same traits as humans i dont think so the whole approach we once had in our industry has come to an end ucb is focused on the neurology and immunology therapy areas we have just launched three new medicines cimzia for rheumatoid arthritis and crohns disease vimpat for epilepsy and neupro for parkinsons disease and restless leg syndrome the launches are rightly recognised as successful so the key for us is to continue on that path and strengthen the pipeline we had four new drugs licensed in  the year  was an impressive one for pipeline progress because all our products developed including new ones coming into the pipeline we are gradually rebuilding our latestage pipeline with epratuzumab a lupus treatment and we have a new epilepsy drug moving into phase iii towards the end of  we announced the antisclerostin product was moving faster than we thought results from phase iib will come in the second half of  the late stage pipeline is starting to build up again lets talk about joint working and what is important for pharmaceutical companies to work together successfully collaboration is about forming alliances with people who have strengths that complement our strengths we have been able to blend internal and external collaborations and build innovative partnerships with smaller companies in order to get access to newer products in our discovery organisation we have literally hundreds of partnerships with small startups university departments and so on science is now so complex that no company can harness everything on its own the notion behind our partnerships is always to ask what we are good at and then build on that anything we need to complement that core approach we go and get it where it exists with antisclerostin for example we had no bone disease expertise in our development organisation hence we made a partnership with amgen and through our immunology research we found compounds that had application in oncology so we put them with wilex which is an oncology biotech company and can get them back when they have been taken to proof of concept weve also done a deal with synosia therapeutics which is focused on parkinsons disease we took a stake giving us access to some of their pipeline products while leaving them to manage themselves thereby building on their strengths though keppra is now off patent in the us and going off patent in the eu in  it will still be a significant product for many years to come because we are launching in japan we still have significant growth in the large emerging markets and even though it is generic in the us we still sell there because established patients dont want to switch from one brand to another ucb sold off some of its businesses in emerging markets to glaxosmithkline now we basically have three areas that are key for us the us europe and the large emerging markets of china korea india mexico turkey russia plus japan we sold our businesses in smaller countries such as malaysia and indonesia as well as in the middle east and africa a company our size cant do everything we are a midsize company and we must focus on the essence of what we do roch doliveux ucb on company growth and patient centricity we have made some cutbacks in the past few years now growth will be driven by new products such as cimizia vimpat and neupro for many years to come plus the latestage products are also expected to come in our largest  patent expiries – the trigger to make big changes  were going to occur and did occur in  zyrtec us and  keppra usthe first measure we took to ensure longterm growth was to transform completely from a diversified chemical group into a pure highend biopharma company specialising in neurology and immunology that was done between  and  by divesting all nonpharma businesses and acquiring celltech and schwarz pharma what weve done is create a new company out of three different entities this is different from usual acquisitions twothirds of which fail the figures suggest ours is a success take cimzia for example which is a much bigger product now than either the market or we thought when we bought celltech it is the same with vimpat peak sales were once €m now estimates are at least €bn we put the companies together by building on each others strengths there are now  people in ucb and less than one third and i am part of that third were here seven years ago twothirds of the people are new or had a celltech or schwarz payslip of the executive committee only i was there seven years ago i had just joined on the board only four people were there seven years ago the amount of change has been radical the good news is that we are now starting to reap the benefits with the new launches and what is in the pipeline all the discovery work is bearing fruit i have a positive view of the rd prospects in the uk we are one of the top investors in rd there early on we recognised that slough was home to an important centre of excellence for celltech so we decided to beef up our discovery capability for the longterm in effect ucb has doubled its rd investment in the uk since  roch doliveux ucb on patient centricitys effect on marketing the beauty of focusing on severe diseases is that we can compete with the biggest pharma companies in the world and match them because there are less specialists when you visit a specialist twice a month a midsize company can compete in most countries we no longer have primary care reps and we dont intend to create such a force so when we do need them we partner with big pharma being patientcentric and really thinking about people is both an enabler and a huge pressure the enabler is that it unleashes energy when you say you are making a difference in peoples lives but it is also a pressure if you are genuinely customercentric if you care about individuals it is a big responsibility vimpat treats a subset of epilepsy partial onset seizures one in three patients has this refractory type of seizure if you provide a new medicine for that every patient who still has these seizures is one too many that is our aspiration the real winning starts with the science and then the key is just getting the payers prescribers and in the us the patient to know that this is available it is not necessarily just us who promotes our products it is also others if the science is out it is out i think my best decision as ceo has been to create a truly patientcentric company
