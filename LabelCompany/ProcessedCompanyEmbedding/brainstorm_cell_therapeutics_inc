securities and exchange commission     company overview     brainstorm cell therapeutics inc is an integrated biotechnology company actively engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative adult stem cell therapies for the treatment of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders that have no or limited treatment options thus representing a unique opportunity to address unmet medical needs these include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis “als” also known as lou gehrig’s disease multiple sclerosis “ms” and parkinson’s disease “pd” among others nurown® is our proprietary process for the propagation of adult bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells “msc” their differentiation into neurotrophic factor“ntf” secreting cells “mscntf” and transplantation at or close to the site of damage   evidence to date from published animal and human studies suggest that nurown ò offers the potential for more effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases relative to existing therapies through unique neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects groundbreaking als csf biomarker work has demonstrated a strongly correlated increase in neurotrophic factors and a reduction in inflammatory biomarkers mcp and sdf in nurown ò treated and not in placebo treated participants this is a clear indicator of the mechanism by which this technology acts in als and in related neurodegenerative diseases   our core technology was developed in collaboration with professor prof daniel offen felsenstein medical research center tel aviv university and the late prof eldad melamed  former head of neurology of the rabin medical center and former member of the scientific committee of the michael j fox foundation for parkinson’s research our whollyowned israeli subsidiary brainstorm cell therapeutics ltd the “israeli subsidiary” holds rights to commercialize the technology through a licensing agreement with ramot at tel aviv university ltd “ramot” the technology transfer company of tel aviv university israel we currently employ  employees in israel and  in the united states   our proprietary technology   facilitated by nurown® technology the differentiated mscntf cells are capable of releasing several highly disease relevant neurotrophic factors including glialderived neurotrophic factor “gdnf” brainderived neurotrophic factor “bdnf” vascular endothelial growth factor “vegf” and hepatocyte growth factor “hgf” all critical for the growth survival and differentiation of developing neurons gdnf is one of the most potent factors involved in the protection and survival of peripheral neurons vegf and hgf have been reported to have important protective effects on neurons and other nonneuronal glial cells in als as well as other neurodegenerative diseases the effects of neurotrophic factors on neurons may include     · protection of existing motor neurons   · promotion of motor neuron growth and   · reestablishment of functional nervemuscle interaction          in addition to the consistent and important release of neurotrophic factors nurown ò demonstrates consistent in vitro modification of the immune response  immunomodulation and in vivo modulation of csf biomarkers neuroinflammation is an important cause of disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases including als the proprietary nurown ò process results in significant measurable differences from undifferentiated mscs including enhanced release of neurotrophic factors release of neurotrophic factors that are very low or not expressed by mscs and a unique microrna profile that may regulate growth and development of neurons neurogenesis vegf and neuroinflammation in preclinical studies nurown ò was found to be more effective than msc in treating autism parkinson’s disease huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis the combination of enhanced ntf release and neuromodulation may be an optimal approach to restore function and reduce ongoing cns tissue damage in neurodegenerative disease   nurown ò treatment is a multistep process see table below beginning with harvesting of undifferentiated stem cells from the patient’s own bone marrow and concluding with transplantation of the resulting differentiated neurotrophic factorsecreting mesenchymal stem cells mscntf back into the patient – intrathecally injection into the cerebrospinal fluid by standard lumbar puncture andor intramuscularly this unique technology is the firstofitskind for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases   the nurown® transplantation process     · bone marrow aspiration from patient   · isolation and propagation of the patient’s mesenchymal stem cells   · differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells into neurotrophicfactor secreting mscntf cells and   · autologous transplantation into the same patient’s spinal cord andor muscle tissue    our proprietary technology process is conducted in full compliance with current good manufacturing practice “cgmp” it is licensed to and developed by our israeli subsidiary   advances of nurown ò beyond current therapies    patient benefits   given that nurown®’s approach involves transplantation of the stem cells derived from the same patient autologous there is no risk of rejection and no need for treatment with immunosuppressive agents which can cause severe andor longterm side effects in addition the use of adult stem cells precludes the controversy associated with the use of embryonic stem cells in some countries   patients received nurown ò in a single administration in the phase  study the phase  program will involve multiple doses  that may be repeated  months later whereas other therapies require multiple daily oral or intravenous administration   msc can be cryopreserved and as required can be subsequently differentiated into nurown® and demonstrate product characteristics like nurown ®  cells derived from fresh msc of the same patientdonor this will allow the company to provide repeated doses of autologous nurown® from a single bone marrow aspirate in its upcoming multidose clinical trial and will avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated bone marrow aspiration for a year period   the als program   phase  and phase a clinical studies for als patients   the clinical development program for nurown® in als has been granted fast track designation by the us food and drug administration the “fda” for this indication and has been granted orphan status in both the united states and in europe we have completed two clinical trials of nurown® in patients with als at hadassah medical center “hadassah” principal investigator pi professor prof dimitrios karussis laboratory services for of nurown® studies for the israeli subsidiary have been provided by hadassah through an agreement with hadasit medical research services and development ltd a subsidiary of the hadassah medical organization   a phase  safety and efficacy study of nurown® in als patients administered either intramuscularly or intrathecally was initiated in june  after receiving approval from the israeli ministry of health “moh” the trial results which were presented by prof karussis at the american academy of neurology annual meeting on march  demonstrated the safety of nurown® as well as signs of als patient functional improvement as measured by the als functional rating score “alsfrsr” and improved breathing as measured by the forced vital capacity “fvc”   a phase a combined intramuscular and intrathecal treatment doseescalating trial approved by the israeli moh in january  was also conducted at hadassah pi prof dimitrios karussis and by september   we announced that  patients had successfully completed treatment on december   prof karussis presented some of the preliminary findings from this trial at the  th  international symposium on alsmnd in milan italy followed in june  by the interim data of the trial at the joint congress of european neurology in istanbul turkey the last followup visits in this study occurred in september  on january   the company presented final top line data from this study in a press release and investor conference call the results of this study confirmed the safety profile observed in the earlier phase  trial with the clear majority of adverse events being lowgrade and transient there were two deaths and two serious adverse events all of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment subjects in this study showed a meaningful reduction in the rate of disease progression for the three and six months after treatment compared to the three months prior to treatment this confirmed the safety of intrathecal administration of nurown ò in als   in january  the company announced the publication of a paper in the january  edition of jama neurology based on the results of the first in man phase  study and phase  dose escalation study with nurown® in als the data provide indication of clinically meaningful benefit as reflected by a slower rate of als disease progression following nurown ò treatment a positive trend on two als disease biomarkers including rate of decline of muscle volume and electrical muscle function this was the first published clinical data with nurown ò  or any treatment to achieve a neuroprotective effect in als and potentially modify the course of disease   in april  the company presented the combined results of the phase  and phase a nurown ò clinical studies in als at the israstem  and th israel stem cell society iscs joint annual meeting which took place in tel aviv israel          us multicenter double blind placebo controlled clinical study for als patients   in december  the company submitted an investigational new drug “ind” application to the fda for nurown® in als and on april   we initiated an fdaapproved randomized doubleblind placebo controlled multicenter us phase  clinical trial evaluating nurown® in als patients the trial was conducted at the massachusetts general hospital pis drs merit cudkowicz and james berry in boston massachusetts at the university of massachusetts memorial hospital pi dr robert brown in worcester massachusetts and at the mayo clinic drs anthony windebank and nathan staff in rochester minnesota for this study nurown® was manufactured at the connell and o’reilly cell manipulation core facility at the dana farber cancer institute in boston massachusetts and at the human cellular therapy lab at the mayo clinic in the study  patients were randomized  to receive nurown® or placebo   in february  the company announced that the data safety monitoring board “dsmb” for the multicenter us phase  clinical trial had reviewed the safety data collected through a cutoff date in january  and did not find any significant lab abnormalities adverse events or significant protocol deviations that would be cause for concern and therefore approved continuation of the trial as planned   on august   the company announced that it had completed enrollment achieving the target of  subjects to be enrolled in its ongoing randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  clinical trial of nurown® in als the company further announced in november  that the dsmb review of the safety data collected through a cutoff date in october  for the multicenter us phase  clinical trial indicated that  of the  patients enrolled in the study confirmed that they experienced no treatmentrelated serious adverse events saes  furthermore the dsmb did not identify any significant adverse events lab abnormalities or significant protocol deviations that would be cause for concern    in july  the company announced topline data from the recently completed us randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  study of nurown® in als which confirmed that the study achieved its primary objective demonstrating that nurown ® was safe and well tolerated  nurown ® also achieved multiple secondary efficacy endpoints showing clear evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit  notably response rates were higher for nurown ® treated subjects compared to placebo at all time points in the study out to  weeks    in october  some of the company’s topline phase  als clinical trial results were presented by dr robert brown and dr james berry at the th annual meeting of the northeast als consortium neals    in december  the company announced that data from the company’s phase  study of nurown ®  in als would be highlighted in presentations at the th international symposium on alsmnd being held december   in dublin ireland lead investigator dr james berry presented new data from the phase  study demonstrating that in als patients treated with nurown ò  csf neurotrophic factors vegf hgf and lif showed a statistically significant increase and correlated with a statistically significant decrease in csf inflammatory markers mcp and sdf two weeks posttransplantation compared to pretransplantation   in addition reductions in csf inflammatory markers at two weeks posttransplantation correlated with improvements in alsfrsr slope at  weeks posttransplantation consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of nurown ò in als dr berry also presented the prespecified responder analyses from the phase  trial which examined percentage improvements in post treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale alsfrsr slope compared to pretreatment slope these analyses showed that in the nurown® treated group a greater number of patients achieved the high threshold of  or greater improvement in the posttreatment vs pretreatment slope compared with the placebo group  responders were defined as those in whom disease symptoms were essentially halted for the period of the treatment effect or those who achieved a positive improvement on their alsfrsr score  moreover in the prespecified subgroup that excluded subjects whose disease was progressing slowly this effect was even more pronounced dr berry’s presentation was posted on the company website    phase  clinical study for als patients    in december  the company announced that it had recently completed a successful endofphase  meeting with the united states food and drug administration fda the company reached general agreement with the fda to proceed to a phase  trial importantly the fda accepted the key elements of the phase  program to support a biologic license application bla for nurown® in als the planned phase  clinical trial will be a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multidose trial that will be conducted at multiple sites in the us and in israel the trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of    in january  the company announced that it had validated its cryopreservation process for nurown® in preparation for the upcoming phase  clinical study in als  the validation involved a comparison of nurown® mscntf cells derived from fresh mesenchymal stem cells msc to those derived from cryopreserved msc  company scientists were successful in showing that the msc can be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for prolonged periods of time while maintaining their characteristics  the cryopreserved msc can differentiate into nurown® similar to the nurown ®  derived from fresh msc of the same patientdonor prior to cryopreservation this will allow the company to provide repeated doses of autologous nurown® from a single bone marrow aspirate in its upcoming multidose clinical trial cryopreservation will avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated bone marrow aspirations          in february  the company announced that it plans to contract with city of hope’s center for biomedicine and genetics to produce clinical supplies of nurown® adult stem cells for the company’s planned randomized doubleblind multidose phase  clinical study in patients with als  city of hope is expected to support all us medical centers that will be participating in the phase  trial    future development of nurown® in als will require additional clinical trials including a phase  fdaapproved multi dose trial    patient access programs    in december  the company announced that it plans to apply for hospital exemption for nurown® in israel that will allow patient access to nurown® as a treatment that has been granted hospital exemption this recently approved pathway would permit the company to partner with a medical center in israel and be allowed to treat patients with nurown® for a fee hospital exemption allows for advanced therapy medicinal products to be made available to a group of patients to be agreed upon by the israeli ministry of health it is intended to provide patients with the possibility to benefit from a custommade innovative individual treatment where there is a critical unmet need and an absence of valid therapeutic alternatives the treatment is usually a custommade product such as nurown® manufactured using a patient’s own cells that are prepared on a nonroutine basis to qualify for a hospital exemption several important criteria must be met including preparation according to specific quality standards equivalent to those for a licensed product use in a hospital and use under the exclusive responsibility of a medical practitioner   in march  the company announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding mou with the medical research infrastructure and health services fund of the tel aviv sourasky medical center ichilov hospital to explore the possibility of making nurown® available to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als patients under the provisions of hospital exemption regulation  the mou also covers the participation of tel aviv sourasky medical center in the planned phase  trial that will investigate nurown® in als    the mou sets forth the basic terms under which the company and tel aviv sourasky medical center would work together to submit an application to the israeli ministry of health that will allow patient access to nurown® and is subject to a definitive agreement  the agreement is expected to be formalized in the first half of    in february  the company announced that it has signed an agreement with ccrm a torontobased leader in developing and commercializing regenerative medicine technologies and cell and gene therapies to support the market authorization request for nurown®   at this time ccrm is assisting the company as it explores the opportunity to access health canada’s early access pathway for treatment of patients with als  if nurown® qualifies for health canada’s “notice of compliance with conditions” pathway it could be authorized in canada for distribution in early      funding   in may  the company announced that for the ninth consecutive year its whollyowned subsidiary brainstorm cell therapeutics ltd was awarded a new grant of approximately  from israel’s office of the chief scientist ocs the office of the chief scientist is part of the ministry of economy program to support innovative technologies in israel the funds supported the development of nurown ® phase  clinical program in als     intellectual property   in october  the company announced that it has been granted united states patent no  titled “mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of cns diseases the allowed claims cover mesenchymal stem cells that secrete neurotrophic factors including brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf and glial derived neurotrophic factor gdnf as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising these factors    future development plans   in addition to its active clinical program in als the company is focusing on further indepth molecular characterization of nurown® and its adaptation to additional indications the company is reviewing the potential clinical development of nurown® in other neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson’s disease huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis more research is currently being done on developing an additional product which might be suitable for many neurodegenerative diseases    brainstorm is pursuing studies to explore the potential benefit of nurown ò in autism a poorly understood disorder of brain development that affects  of the worldwide population and for which there are no approved drug treatments in april  the company announced the publication of the nurown® autism research study entitled “long term beneficial effect of neurotrophic factorssecreting mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in the btbr mouse model of autism” perets n et al behav brain res  apr  epub ahead of print pmid  showing that transplantation of nurown® in the btbr mice demonstrated significant longterm improvements in autistic behavior in the btbr mice compared to msc treated and to untreated btbr mice   in addition the company is engaged in several research initiatives to improve the scale and efficiency of nurown® production and to improve the stability of nurown® which is currently produced in clean room facilities close to the clinical trial sites where the cells are administered to patients

will allow us to meet our obligations throughout second quarter of  including the initiation of a phase  trial that will include  patients in the upcoming  months assuming the multi dose clinical trial will include  patients and will not be expanded into a power trial   over the longer term if we are not able to raise substantial additional capital we may not be able to continue to function as a going concern and may have to cease operations or the company will reduce its costs including curtailing its current plan to pursue larger clinical trials in als and move new indications into clinical testing we will be required to raise a substantial amount of capital in the future in order to reach profitability and to complete the commercialization of our products our ability to fund these future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the following      • our ability to obtain funding from third parties including any future collaborative partners     • the scope rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development programs     • the time and costs required to gain regulatory approvals     • the terms and timing of any
