philosophy investment philosophy overpaying for a stock is one of the greatest investment risks it can be managed by developing an intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioaps’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since aps’ founding in investigative research beyond bottomupasian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by  experienced local investment professionals and  probing research we conduct onsite visits field investigations including interviews with former employees competitors suppliers industry specialists and other stakeholders and verification of information and data with independent sources the extensive granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock conduct due diligence and think independently of consensusrigorous valuationduring some market cycles investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly thus tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retaildominated asian markets instead portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alphadiversified strategies please see our explanation of alpha groups in the alpha groups  generation section  our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth and whether the listed price reflects that worth the key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals sell disciplinewe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when  prices run ahead of fundamentals  initial assumptions are proven wrong  there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company redefining riskin our view there are risks greater than volatility such as overpaying for a security visàvis its fundamentals that is why we examine every stock insideout before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles political fluctuations regulatory changes structural events management changeovers among otherswe also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of highconviction stocks which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time and as appropriate in order to earn an illiquidity premium competitive advantages from aps’ investment approach our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process it goes beyond bottomup research  when the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions without being influenced by market noise this knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when lessinformed investors irrationally run for the exit revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets   get in touch    csapscomsg investment philosophy investment

cio wong kok hoi in singapore since then the firm has grown significantly starting with assets under management of about usd million which have since grown to usd billion as of the end of august in   aps started with just seven staff in one office which has now expanded to more than  staff and six offices worldwide despite these expansions the core values and vision of aps have not changed in the beginning mr wong founded aps for three reasons these include serving global institutional asset owners specialising in asian investments as well as employing investigative research and independent thinking in the investment process all three foundations have remained constant throughout aps’ history today nearly  of our aum are from pensions endowments and foundations and the rest are from family offices financial institutions sovereign wealth funds corporates and high networth individualsas mentioned before aps’ investment decisions are predicated on investigative research and independent thinking our company research includes interviews with suppliers competitors peers customers former employees industry specialists management employees and other relevant stakeholders through this process our analysts walk the ground visit facilities test the products where possible and read the fine print this process gives aps sufficient knowledge to make and importantly maintain highconviction decisions even when the market temporarily runs against our contrarian stock selections for years at a stretch knowing each stock insideout also allows us to revise our investment theses when circumstances change and effectively value a stock and to set valuation targetsaps is a boutique in the sense that we are highly specialised have our skin in the game alongside investors and are agile decisive and bold our corporate infrastructure has the depth and breadth expected of a firm serving global institutional asset owners we have fully staffed inhouse teams for investment risk management compliance trading investment administration client services marketing sales and corporate functions aps’ headquarters is in singapore and we have three research offices in shanghai

schmidt eurekahedge reflections on  and prospects for the coming year wong kok hoi is the managing director and chief investment officer of aps asset management based in singapore he has been the lead manager of the aps asia pacific hedge fund since its launch in april  prior to establishing aps mr wong was employed by citibank and the gic in singapore he has  years of investment experience the aps asia pacific hedge fund is an asia including japan equity longshort fund it was up  for the year  interview with wong kok hoi how did the marketing efforts go at the goldman sachs conference in tokyo and what are the marketing plans for  the trip to the goldman conference in tokyo was fruitful we had more than  oneonone meetings with prospective investors two fundoffunds are now looking seriously at investing in our fund currently the fund size is us million now that we have built a trackrecord we are planning a roadshow to the states and europe early next year we believe we should meet with some success because our performance has been strong since its inception in april  up  making it one of the best funds this year this is despite the volatility and uncertainties in the asian markets what are the current risks for your portfolio if the united states proceeds with military action in iraq in the first quarter of  how are you addressing these issues today the aps asia pacific hedge fund is very much a marketneutral fund ie with low net exposure to the market we create our alphas from pure stock selection rather than marketdirectional bets therefore events such as a war in iraq or terrorists attacks dont affect our fund negatively we will make money for as long as our stockpicking skills continue to be sharp this comes from diligent work into company fundamental research and valuation work this has been our competitive edge all these years the annualised standard deviation for the fund is quite high at  per annum since the fund was launched in april  is this volatility a concern or are you marketing the fund as a high riskreturn product i am aware that the investment community in general has a fascination with standard deviation as a measure of risk at aps we take a different view we do not see volatility in isolation we see it together with mean return in our view a fund with a minus  return with a standard deviation of  is a riskier investment than a fund with a mean return of  with a standard deviation of  regardless of the angle from which you look at it i will bet my house on the later fund anytime we at aps believe that we reduce the risk of the fund by undertaking careful company research and doing detailed valuation work and by so doing we aim to push the mean return of the fund as far to the right as possible we dont think by tweaking the standard deviation you are actually reducing portfolio risk i wish investing was as simple as we studied in textbooks since we launched our fund it has not broken below par value you cant say that our fund is risky when you dont lose money can you we think you reduce your fund risk by not making big bets especially with your short positions and not by guessing the market direction hence we never thought not even for a moment that we are running a high riskreturn fund you made very healthy returns in going short japanese banks is this a trade that you still view as having profit potential firstly we dont take trading positions which is unique for longshort hedge funds all our positions are established for the longterm many japanese banks have negative equity so although we had made a killing by shorting them we dont think it is time to square our positions yet i need to see some signs that the economy is about to turn the corner before i square my positions what other sectors are you finding interesting in japan for both the long and short portfolios selective stocks in the drug video game electronic auto and consumer finance sectors make interesting long candidates and the majority of stocks in the remaining sectors are excellent short candidates in a nutshell i think japan is a fertile ground for short candidates what countries and sectors in your mandate are you most optimistic about for  we are bullish on the manufacturing consumer finance drug and consumer sectors we have no preference for any country we are particularly bearish on banks property telecommunications and governmentrun companies how are you finding the current conditions to borrow in korea are you shorting individual names in taiwan through swap arrangements currently we do not have short positions in either taiwan or korea however we are currently looking at some korean stocks swaps are expensive and we eschew paying high costs you also run an extensive relativevalue book in the fund what is the relationship of this book with the investment style for the rest of the fund and the firm that is correct about  of our positions within the fund are correlated in one way or another we have for instance a pair between japanese banks and korean credit card companies such as lg card we believe that over the long run creditcard companies are certainly more profitable than japanese banks korean creditcard companies are making a spread of about  versus the  that banks are struggling to make longrun sustainable roes of lg card for instance is expected to be above  as against japanese banks making negative or low singledigit roes lg card is selling at a forward pe of about x and pricetobook of close to x this is definitely a classic example of what we do at aps investing in companies with strong structural and competitive advantages that will last for at least  years  and buying them when they are still cheap we are prepared to hold these stocks longterm and weather the market gyrations in between we will then short stocks that suffer structural weaknesses and are overvalued once the positions are taken we will keep a very close watch on any possible changes in the fundamentals of these companies what are your views on exposure both net and gross going into january  initially when we first started out the fund we wanted to leverage the fund quite substantially however with the benefit of our experience so far we found out that this was not possible to date our gross and net exposures have been less than  and  respectively going forward our net exposure will decline even further we really want to generate alpha through our stock picking skills and nothing else can you discuss your current views on venture manufacturing singapore and samsung electronics south korea the two biggest holdings in the fund at the end of november venture manufacturing remains the most profitable contract manufacturer in the world today the companys firsthalf results announced in september  showed that the company continued to surprise investors on the upside its net profits were up not  or  but  in times when other contract manufacturers are bleeding credit must go to senior management we have invested in and tracked the company for  years now and we think management is first class we are not selling yet because the company will continue to benefit from the accelerating outsourcing trend samsung electronics is a story that most people are familiar with it is the world leader in drams and tftlcd and is rapidly increasing global market share in the mobile handset business the company is immensely profitable with free cashflow that alone is expected to be usbn this year pretax profits exceeding usbn with so much cash the company is able to invest in building fabs and rd that pulls it ahead in the technological race while its competitors lag behind the amazing thing is that the stock is not priced at x pe as you might expect but is priced at about x pe we think that the company will be a very powerful and dominant technology company this decade   contact details aps asset management singapore    wwwapscomsg top email this article to a friend

volatility in  alternative addressing market volatility in   tripp zimmerman  associate director of research tweet share feedback regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out or underperform market capweighted indexes over long periods we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles partly by tilting toward known return premiums in  value and size ie small caps underperformed but momentum quality and low volatility outperformed now the question is what factors will perform best in  and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market wisdomtree recently created the wisdomtree dynamic longshort us equity index wtdls designed to generate alpha at the core with a multifactor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically key features to wisdomtree approach wisdomtree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade typically focusing on signal factors such as value quality and size but now we are pleased to introduce this new multifactor approach the wisdomtree dynamic long us equity index wtdl is the long component of wtdls and comprises approximately  stocks with the highest combined fundamentals which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly • fundamental selection stocks are graded on a combination of growth quality and value factors and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion it is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another by combining quality and value factors which we believe complement each other we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term while still tapping into the longterm return premiums   • lowvolatility weighting in each sector the index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market we know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor so we believe applying it to a multifactor selection model will also add value   • sectorneutral capping the index targets a sectorneutral allocation when compared to the largest  us stocks by market capitalization we believe this keeps the index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or lowvolatility weighting to significantly over or underweight certain sectors we are confident about the stock selection and weighting process so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a capweighted index to get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process we compared wtdl against popular market capweighted style and factor indexes   index valuations for definitions of terms and indexes in the chart visit our glossary   • attractive across multiple valuation measures we find it impressive but not surprising that wtdl scored high on multiple valuation measures as of  wtdl had the highest dividend yield it also showed similar pricetoearnings pe ratios as the sp  value index both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value wtdl had the secondhighest quality metrics defined by return on equity roe and return on assets roa a very close second only to the msci usa quality index which focuses more directly on that factor lastly wtdl had higher profit margins than the sp  index and very similar growth expectations   dynamic hedging indicator the above table highlights how wtdl had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy for one thing the lowvolatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator the dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage so when the fundamentals or profits of the universe are deteriorating the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage similarly as valuations become more stretched adding risk to the portfolio the indicator would look to hedge as well while our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of  and signaled to be  hedge for january  making the net equity exposure for
