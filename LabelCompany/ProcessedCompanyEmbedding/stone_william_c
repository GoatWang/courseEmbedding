themes of urban sociology developed by nineteenthcentury classic theorists and early american social scientists in part ii the authors look at selected aspects of everyday city life including the bases of community the primacy of social interaction for an understanding of urban life and conditions that produce the breakdown of urban tolerance for diversity of cultures and lifestyles a new
