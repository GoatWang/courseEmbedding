issue richland center renewable energy — midwest environmental advocates is representing a group of citizens near richland center who oppose another discharge of polluted wastewater to the lower wisconsin river system latest news victory in late february  a group of individuals concerned about water quality in the lower wisconsin river successfully reached an agreement with richland center renewable energy llc rcre to reduce pollution in area waterways the settlement agreement includes a plan for the renewable energy company to reduce the impact of phosphorus pollution from its facility as well as from area nonpoint sources through projects implemented friends of the lower wisconsin river flow and richland county land conservation department read the full press release under the final agreement rcre will install phosphorus removal technology by the end of this year and make any additional improvements to meet phosphorus requirements by january   richland center renewable energy will also provide substantial funds for nonpoint source phosphorus pollution reduction measures  a substantial portion of these funds will be used by flow to establish conservation easement buffers to limit the phosphorus pollution in the lower wisconsin state riverway the friends of the lower wisconsin riverway inc flow provides a grassroots voice for the protection and enhancement of the lower wisconsin state riverway  flow supports a broad spectrum of riverway activities including natural resource protection environmental research river education cultural and historic preservation and community support case summary richland center wisconsin is home to several cheese processing facilities that each have their own water pollution permits to discharge wastewater to the lower wisconsin river or its tributaries in addition to these permits the facilities send some of their wastewater to the richland center water treatment works for treatment since  the city’s treatment center has been in repeated violation of its water pollution permit limits the city provided documentation to the department of natural resources that the violations have been caused by increased pollution from these cheese facilities the proposed solution to this problem is richland center renewable energy rcre an anaerobic digester that takes whey permeate and other dairy biproducts from cheese facilities and treats it with microorganisms in order to reduce waste and create energy while this is a good idea this facility still has wastewater to discharge the dnr issued a waste pollution permit to rcre in early  neighbors of these cheese facilities and the proposed rcre facility were concerned about what another water pollution discharge will mean for the pine river and the lower wisconsin river waterbodies that will receive the wastewater pollution these neighbors enjoy fishing swimming and boating in the pine river and the wisconsin river and enjoy the diverse fish and wildlife that live in and around the river corridors midwest environmental advocates helped these citizens challenge this permit under current law the dnr permit is illegal because it authorizes rcre to discharge wastewater upstream of the lower wisconsin river without a sufficient antidegradation review authorizes a new discharge of phosphorus to a waterway that currently exceeds the phosphorus water quality criteria and authorizes a compliance schedule for a new pollution discharge to achieve phosphorus water quality criteria ◀ ▶ latest news dnr draft livestock waste
