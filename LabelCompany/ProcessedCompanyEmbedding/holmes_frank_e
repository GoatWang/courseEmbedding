precious metal for the week was silver trading off  percent followed closely by gold silver and gold fell this week as a tentative deal by us congress to avert a government shutdown curbed safehaven demand for the precious metals reports bloomberg analysts from boci believe gold has a “more challenging” outlook moving forward according to a report this week citing two more rate hikes and the fed’s balance sheet unwind us stocks resumed their advance this week with optimistic earnings reports pushing the dollar back up and gold lower the perth mint released april sales numbers this week reporting that april gold coin and minted bar sales came in at  ounces this is a drop from sales of  ounces in march silver sales also dropped in april to  ounces from   ounces in march workers at freeport mcmoran’s grasberg copper and gold mine in indonesia started to down their tools at am local time reports bloomberg the company’s labor union and ptfi management have yet to agree on labor issues and around  employees have joined the stoppage workers plan to down tools until may  to protest job cuts the article continues opportunities doubleline capital’s jeffrey gundlach believes that now is “not the time to give up on gold” reports bloomberg in a tuesday webcast gundlach said that gold prices are likely to head higher and also noted his secular bear view on oil prices because of improving fracking technology that cut costs this week was a bad one for oil as it retreated to a level not seen since opec forged its landmark agreement to cut output last november bloomberg writes “with all the shale producers coming online in the states it’s very much taking the wind out of sails of the uptick we got from the opec agreement” said james audiss of shaw and partners in a press release wednesday red pine exploration reported the intersection of visible gold in new drill holes south of its surluga deposit “visible gold observed in all seven holes drilled in the southern extension of the minto mine shear zone” the release notes in separate mining news the commission of appointments in the philippines has voted not to confirm regina lopez as secretary of the department of environment and natural resources reports argonaut lopez had taken a hard stance on mining with a view that the sector had negatively impacted the environment and farming communities now mine closures are unlikely to proceed over to china gold production in the first quarter saw a significant drop with mined output falling  percent one report notes chinese gold miners have reduced output due to low prices klondex mines kdx cn kldx reported financial results on thursday after the close with the stock hitting a week low that day klondex’s share price has been depressed by a series of events much of which are unrelated to its operational performance back in march the van eck vectors junior gold miners etf gdxj was supposed to sell its top  holdings and reinvest the proceeds into existing holdings which meant around  million shares would be bought by the etf however the gdxj etf did not follow the asset mix provided by their index provider because they would have ended up owning  percent or more of the shares outstanding for many of their holdings which would trigger certain canadian stock exchange rules concerning takeovers next klondex had to delay its operational reporting by one week because the shareholder base shifted to majority us holders which required the company to switch from ifrs accounting to us gaap klondex bought the true north mine out of receivership and the hollister acquisition from private owners last year although both properties had resources in the measured indicated and inferred categories there were no proven and probable reserves under sec rules klondex had to treat all the capital improvements on both properties as expenses thus hitting the income statement and appeared as though the company missed on its earnings later in midapril the gdxj announced a new method for reweighting the stocks it owns by downweighting the existing holdings including klondex and using the proceeds to buy midtier gold producers the messaging on the klondex earnings call on friday was well received much of the repositioning for the upcoming gdxj rebalancing trade seems to be in the market now and investors now have a timely opportunity to buy klondex mines after touching a week low largely on issues unrelated to the operational performance of the company threats major bulk miners have some of the same issues seen in the gold sector according to a report from deutsche bank large miners’ “stayinbusiness” sib capex could increase  percent in  “while total capex will likely remain low nearterm  billion in   billion in  we will see sustainingsib capex increasing over the medium term as most miners catch up on the underinvestment over the past five years” the report notes bottomup analysis suggests that while truck fleet replacement will remain low waste stripping will increase significantly it continues in november steven mnuchin hinted that the trump administration would entertain the idea of selling ultralong bonds reports bloomberg with wall street coming to a consensus don’t do it and on monday the article continues mnuchin provided the clearest signal saying this plan “could absolutely make sense” jeffrey gundlach says that doubleline would not buy year treasuries for its mutual funds should they become available in fact he said “it opens the door to burdening our greatgrandchildren to a significant degree” investors pulled  million dollars from the vaneck vectors gold miners etf reports bloomberg the largest outflows on record the withdrawals coincided with the outcome of the first round of the french presidential elections the article continues in a similar note jeffries reported monday that large cap etfs increased their assets by  percent via inflows of almost  billion with small caps increasing assets by  percent via inflows of over  billion the group also noted outflows across most of its categories being muted with the biggest being technology and gld with about
