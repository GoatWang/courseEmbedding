contact us at  or infodxindustriescom about dx industries  about dx industries inc is a precision manufacturing company capable of producing a wide range of products using additive and subtractive manufacturing processes using our state of the art d metal printing system composite printing equipment and numerous cnc precision machining centers dx industries will exceed your expectations for prototype production and assembly services dx industries uses binder jet technology to d print complex parts binder jet is a powder bed process where a binding agent is used to selectively ‘print’ the desired part shape by adhesively joining the metal particles after the jetting process the green part is sintered in a furnace to burn off the binder an infiltrant typically bronze is then melted and drawn into the part to fill in the spaces of the sintered metal powder skeleton to create a fully dense component the threedimensional printing process produces fully functional metal parts directly from cad files the benefits of the binder jet  process include enhanced part design flexibility complex internal geometries undercuts angled passages and the opportunity to create component features that cannot be duplicated with traditional machining methods the d printing process generates singlepiece and multipiece designs with shortened lead times at significantly lower costs not just d printing in addition to our d metal printing capabilities dx has a full array of cnc precision machining centers capable of high speed precision milling up to large capacity vertical machining to meet the most demanding specifications our clients require we also have an inhouse d composite printer for smaller component prototype and production runs using our composite printing system we can

 faqs below are the frequently asked questions if you do not see an answer to your question please contact us what is additive manufacturing additive manufacturing is exploding on the manufacturing scene as leading companies are transitioning from “analog” to “digital” manufacturing additive manufacturing uses three dimensional printing to transform engineering design files into fully functional and durable objects created from sand metal and glass the technology creates products layer by layer – after a layer’s particles are bound by heat or chemicals the next layer is added and the binding process is repeated it enables geometries not previously possible to be manufactured fullform parts are made directly from computeraided design cad data for a variety of industrial commercial and art applications why did dx decide to transition into the additive manufacturing arena companies that use additive manufacturing reduce costs lower the risk of trial and error and create opportunities for design innovation a serious limitation of subtractive manufacturing is that part designs are often severely comprised to accommodate the constraints of the subtractive process additive manufacturing enables both the design and the materialization of objects by eliminating traditional manufacturing constraints what are some of the advantages of additive manufacturing cost and time savings – additive manufacturing swiftly creates product prototypes – an increasingly critical function that significantly reduces the traditional trialanderror process – so new products can enter the market more quickly likewise it can promptly create unique or specialized metal products that can replace worn or broken industrial parts that means companies can avoid costly shut downs and drastically compress the time it takes to machine a replacement part with additive manufacturing once a cad drawing is created the replacement part can be printed storage of bulky patterns and tooling is virtually eliminated environmental impact – additive manufacturing produces less waste – since the process involves adding layers of material to create a part or product vrs subtracting material there is much less waste to be recycled using additive manufacturing processes are there environmental benefits to using the additive manufacturing process yes in traditional manufacturing objects are created in a subtractive manner as metals are trimmed and shaped to fit together properly this process creates substantial waste that can be harmful to the environment additive manufacturing is a very energy efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing option what are the benefits of having additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing under the same roof there are many components parts and prototypes that can be made using the additive manufacturing process however there are certain situations that are best served using traditional manufacturing methods including “touchup’s” or “tweek’s”of printed parts that can only be done using traditional precision machining process’s this is generally found within the corporate arena such as high tech components aeronautics military automotive or any other situation that would require more of a high precision “fit” this is not generally required when dealing with more cosmetic components such as jewelry art knickknacks or other such objectsitems that are more cosmetic than functional dx industries can handle either situation which is a great benefit to our customers as we are truly a onestopshop for their manufacturing needs can you outline the process for printing a d metal part using your mflex system the process begins with a cad file provided by you or created by us the mflex’s builtin software slices the cad file into very thin layers  –  inch  – mm the machine spreads a layer of powdered metal in the build box a printhead moves across the layer depositing liquid binder according to the design for that layer the layer dries and the build box is lowered slightly a new layer of powdered material is spread repeating this process until all layers have been completed the build box now contains a fully printed and bound part surrounded by loose powder which acts as a support the part is considered in a “green state” at this point and very fragile the printed part is depowdered and goes into a furnace for sintering which burns out the binder and fuses the metal molecules making a hardened part approximately  dense metal parts are now strong and can be handled but still contain tiny internal gaps therefore infiltration a second thermal process is required to bring parts up to full density the mflex materialization systems typically utilize a bronze infiltrant thermallyprocessed metal parts are near  density and can be used functionally – not only as prototypes a variety of finishing options are available including protective coats and plating what type of material are you able to print in our mflex d metal printing system is able to print in stainless steel bronze tungsten and glass at this time new materials are being studied and tested to create even more versatility keep an eye on our website for updates our zcorp d composite printer prints with high performance composites allowing us to create a variety of products and prototypes out of plastics please call us for specifics

development and design of a new and innovative product used for recovering excess heat from high energy grow lights the product captures excess heat energy at the individual grow light source before it can raise the overall grow room temperature the captured heat energy can then either be exhausted outside of the facility or routed to areas within the facility or nearby that require heat initial engineering studies are indicating a reduction in overall air conditioning electrical load by up to  dx industries research and development team has been working on the design and beta testing of the product for the past year and is now ready to begin prototype production of the component the part was designed specifically for the legalized cannabis markets including medical marijuana using the companys d metal printing  binder additive manufacturing process and is expected to be installed in select licensed facilities for real world testing in the coming monthsnorth american marijuana sales

comments we have invested considerable time and effort to identify and develop a product that we expect will benefit the growing of medical marijuana by designing and manufacturing a component intended to significantly reduce the costs of facility operations by directly reducing costs to the manufacturer the benefits of a more affordable end product can also be realized by the end user not to mention our product has a direct effect on reducing energy consumption which is a benefit to the environment as wellthe product can be easily fitted to existing and new facilities with minimal

services to its customersabout binder jet binder jetting is a powder bed process where a binder is used to selectively print the desired part shape by adhesively joining the metal particles after the jetting process the green part is sintered in a furnace to burn off the binder and then an infiltrant typically bronze is melted and drawn into the part to fill in the remaining spaces within the sintered metal powder skeleton to create a dense component the resulting parts combine properties from both the metal powder and the infiltrantsafe harbor dx encourages those interested in our company

important and helpful to know  the internet and globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional salons and spa this new trend is forcing salons and spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper traditionally salons and spas were using professional domestic and foreign popular brandname skin care products up to recent past these brands were truly exclusive only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers this process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beautysupply stores current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity inevitably the internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brandname product that you sell in your salon in a much faster more convenient and more affordable way the distributors that you rely on for your exclusivity are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brandname products found previously only at professional salons and spas like yours now literally anyone can purchase retail in a beauty supply store or online almost any salon brandname
