thermoregulation     chapter  highrisk newborn acquired and congenital conditions   multiple choice   the infant of a diabetic mother is hypoglycemic which type of feeding should be instituted first a glucose water b dw intravenously c formula via nasogastric tube d small amount of glucose water followed by formula or breast milk       which defect is present with tetralogy of fallot a patent ductus arteriosus b coarctation of the aorta c hypertrophy of the right ventricle d transposition of the great arteries       the nurse is responsible for monitoring the feedings of the infant with hyperbilirubinemia every  to  hours around the clock the purpose of these formula feedings or breastfeedings is to a prevent hyperglycemia b provide fluids and protein c decrease gastrointestinal motility d prevent rapid emptying of the bilirubin from the bowel       an infant with severe meconium aspiration syndrome is not responding to conventional treatment which method of treatment may be available at a level iii facility for use with this infant a insertion of an endotracheal tube b respiratory support with a ventilator c extracorporeal membrane oxygenation d insertion of a laryngoscope and suctioning of the trachea       four hours after the birth of a healthy neonate of an insulindependent type  diabetic mother the baby appears jittery and irritable and has a highpitched cry which nursing action has top priority a notify the clinician stat b test for the blood glucose level c start an intravenous line with dw d document the event in the nurses’ notes       which newborn should the nurse recognize as being most at risk for developing respiratory distress syndrome a a weekgestation male baby born vaginally to a mother addicted to heroin b a weekgestation female baby born vaginally  hours after the rupture of membranes c a weekgestation male baby born by cesarean birth to a mother with insulindependent diabetes d a weekgestation female baby born vaginally to a mother who has pregnancyinduced hypertension       transitory tachypnea of the newborn ttn is thought to occur as a result of a a lack of surfactant b hypoinflation of the lungs c delayed absorption of fetal lung fluid d a slow vaginal birth associated with meconiumstained fluid     the nurse must continually assess the infant who has meconium aspiration syndrome for the complication of a persistent pulmonary hypertension b bronchopulmonary dysplasia c transitory tachypnea of the newborn d lefttoright shunting of blood through the foramen ovale     the nurse present at the birth is reporting to the nurse who will be caring for the neonate after birth which information should be included for an infant who had thick meconium in the amniotic fluid a the parents spent an hour bonding with the baby after birth b an iv was started immediately after birth to treat dehydration c there was no meconium below the vocal cords when they were visualized d the infant needed vigorous stimulation immediately after birth to initiate crying       which intervention should make phototherapy most effective in reducing the indirect bilirubin in an affected newborn a turn the infant every  hours b place eye patches on the newborn c wrap the infant in triple blankets to prevent cold stress d increase the oral intake of water between and before feedings     a mother with diabetes has done some reading about the effects of her condition on a newborn which statement shows a misunderstanding that should be clarified by the nurse a “the red appearance of my baby’s skin is due to an excessive number of red blood cells” b “my baby will be watched closely for signs of low blood sugar especially during the early days after birth” c “my baby’s pancreas may not produce enough insulin because the cells became smaller than normal during my pregnancy” d “although my baby is large some women with diabetes have very small babies because the blood flow through the placenta may not be as good as it should be”       newborns whose mothers are substance abusers frequently have which behaviors a hypothermia decreased muscle tone and weak sucking reflex b excessive sleep weak cry and diminished grasp reflex c circumoral cyanosis hyperactive babinski reflex and constipation d decreased amounts of sleep hyperactive moro reflex and difficulty feeding       when a cardiac defect causes the mixing of arterial and venous blood in the right side of the heart the nurse might expect to find a cyanosis b diuresis c signs of pulmonary congestion d increased oxygenation of the tissues       in an infant with cyanotic cardiac anomaly the nurse should expect to see a feedings taken eagerly b a consistent and rapid weight gain c a decrease in the heart rate with activity d little to no improvement in color with oxygen administration     the difference between pathologic jaundice and physiologic jaundice is that pathologic jaundice a usually results in kernicterus b appears during the first  hours of life c begins on the head and progresses down the body d results from the breakdown of excessive erythrocytes not needed after birth     while caring for a postterm infant the nurse recognizes that the elevated hematocrit level most likely results from a hypoxia in utero b underproduction of red blood cells c increased breakdown of red blood cells d the normal expected shift from fetal hemoglobin to normal hemoglobin       shortly after a cesarean birth a newborn begins to exhibit difficulty breathing nasal flaring and slight retractions are noted the newborn is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit nicu for closer observation with a diagnosis of transient tachypnea ttn the parents are notified and become anxious because they have no idea what this means in terms of medical condition the best action that the nurse can take at this time is to a refer them to the neonatologist for more information b tell them not to worry because their infant will be monitored closely by trained staff c explain to them that this often occurs following a birth but it will most likely resolve in the next  to  hours d tell them that they will be able to come and see their baby which will help make them feel better       while in utero the fetus passes meconium based on this assessment which nursing diagnosis takes priority for the newborn at birth a risk for infection related to release of meconium b risk for injury related to highrisk birth interventions such as amino infusion c risk for aspiration related to retained secretions d risk for thermoregulation because of highrisk labor status     which diagnostic test is used to help confirmation of hyperbilirubinemia in an infant a direct coombs test based on maternal blood sample b indirect coombs test based on infant cord blood sample c infant bilirubin level d maternal blood type       which of the following lab values indicates that an infant may have polycythemia a hb  gdl hct  b hb dl hct  c hb dl hct  d hb  gdl hct        the nurse’s immediate action after the birth of a postterm infant with meconium stained amniotic fluid is to a stimulate the infant to cry b suction the infant’s airways c complete the  and minute apgars d vigorously dry the infant’s head and trunk       the nurse notes that the infant has been feeding poorly over the last  hours she should immediately assess for other signs of a hyperglycemia b neonatal infection c hemolytic anemia d increased bilirubin levels     the priority assessment for the rhpositive infant whose mother’s indirect coombs test was positive at  weeks is a skin color b temperature c respiratory rate d blood glucose level       the nurse should be alert to a blood group incompatibility if a both mother and infant are opositive b mother is apositive and infant is anegative c mother is opositive and infant is bnegative d mother is bpositive and infant is onegative     chapter  family planning   multiple choice
