rebound in  with overall home prices moving higher in many regions as demand increased and the supply of homes for sale remained restricted however the sharp decline in the share of foreclosed home sales currently being experienced which is contributing to the increase in home sale prices may not continue as the impact of servicers resuming foreclosure activities and the listing of the underlying properties for sale along with the recent increases in mortgage interest rates could slow down future price gains in addition certain courts and state legislatures have issued new rules or statutes relating to foreclosures scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts also in some areas officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding the combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures which will take time to resolve if a significant number of foreclosures come to market at

accompanying prospectus supplement investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the basket stocks you should understand the risks of investing in the notes and should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration with your advisers with respect to the notes in light of your particular financial and other circumstances and the information set forth in this term sheet and the accompanying product supplement prospectus supplement and prospectus   in addition to the risks in the product supplement identified below you should review “risk factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement including the explanation of risks relating to the notes described in the section “— risks relating to all note issuances”   § if the notes are not called your investment will result in a loss there is no guaranteed return of principal   § your return on the notes may be less than the yield you could earn by owning a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity   § payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the notes if we become insolvent or are unable to pay our obligations you may lose your entire investment   § your investment return is limited to the return represented by the applicable call premium and may be less than a comparable investment directly in the basket stocks   § the estimated initial value of the notes is less than the public offering price and may differ from the market value of the notes in the secondary market if any we determined the estimated initial value by reference to our or our affiliates’ internal pricing models these pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables which can include volatility and interest rates these pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events which may prove to be incorrect different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are different from our estimated initial value the estimated initial value reflects our internal funding rate we use to issue marketlinked notes as well as the midmarket value of the hedging arrangements related to the notes which may include call options put options or other derivatives   § our internal funding rate for the issuance of these notes is lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities this is one of the factors that may result in the market value of the notes being less than their estimated initial value as a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities the estimated initial value of the notes may be lower if it were based on the levels at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market in addition if we were to use the rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances we would expect the economic terms of the notes to be more favorable to you   § the price of your notes in the secondary market if any immediately after the pricing date will be less than the public offering price the public offering price takes into account certain costs principally the underwriting discount the hedging costs described on page ts and the costs associated with issuing the notes the costs associated with issuing the notes will be used or retained by us or one of our affiliates if you were to sell your notes in the secondary market if any the price you would receive for your notes may be less than the price you paid for them   § the estimated initial value does not represent a minimum price at which we mlpfs or any of our respective affiliates would be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market if any exists at any time the price of your notes in the secondary market if any at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors including the value of the market measure and changes in market conditions and cannot be predicted with accuracy the notes are not designed to be shortterm trading instruments and you should therefore be able and willing to hold the notes to maturity any sale of the notes prior to maturity could result in a loss to you   § a trading market is not expected to develop for the notes neither we nor mlpfs is obligated to make a market for or to repurchase the notes there is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price in any secondary market   § our business hedging and trading activities and those of mlpfs and our respective affiliates including trades in shares of the basket stocks and any hedging and trading activities we mlpfs or our respective affiliates engage in for our clients’ accounts may affect the market value and return of the notes and may create conflicts of interest with you   § changes in the price of one basket stock may be offset by changes in the prices of the other basket stocks   § you will have no rights of a holder of the basket stocks and you will not be entitled to receive shares of the basket stocks or dividends or other distributions by the underlying companies   § while we mlpfs or our respective affiliates may from time to time own securities of the underlying companies we mlpfs and our respective affiliates do not control any underlying company and are not responsible for any disclosure made by any underlying company   § the payments on the notes will not be adjusted for all

calculation agent we have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent   § the us federal income tax consequences of the notes are uncertain and may be adverse to a holder of the notes see “summary tax consequences” below and “us federal income tax summary” beginning on page ps of product supplement stock str   additional risk factors   the basket stocks are concentrated in one sector  all of the basket stocks are issued by companies in the financial services sector although an investment in the notes will not give holders any ownership or other direct interests in the basket stocks the return on an investment in the notes will be subject to certain risks associated with a direct equity investment in companies in the financial services sector including those discussed below accordingly by investing in the notes you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment linked to companies that operate in multiple sectors in addition because the basket stocks are concentrated in one sector their prices may increase or decrease at similar times and by similar magnitudes and they may perform similarly over the term of the notes you will be subject to risks relating to the relationship among the basket stocks   adverse conditions in the financial services sector may reduce your return on the notes  all of the basket stocks are issued by companies whose primary lines of business are directly associated with the financial services sector the profitability of these companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly particularly when market interest rates change credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of these companies’ customers can negatively impact the sector in addition adverse international economic business or political developments including with respect to the insurance sector or to real estate and loans secured by real estate could have a major effect on the prices of the basket stocks as a result of these factors the value of the notes may be subject to greater volatility and be more adversely affected by economic political or regulatory events relating to the financial services sector   economic conditions have adversely impacted the stock prices of many companies in the financial services sector and may do so during the term of the notes in recent years international economic conditions have resulted and may continue to result in significant losses among many companies that operate in the financial services sector these conditions have also resulted and may continue to result in a high degree of volatility in the stock prices of financial institutions and substantial fluctuations in the profitability of these companies numerous financial services companies have experienced substantial decreases in the value of their assets taken action to raise capital including the issuance of debt or equity securities or even ceased operations further companies in the financial services sector have been subject to unprecedented government actions and regulation which may limit the scope of their operations and in turn result in a decrease in value of these companies any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the performance of the basket stocks as a result the prices of the basket stocks may be adversely affected by economic political or regulatory events affecting the financial services sector or one of the subsectors of the financial services sector this in turn could adversely impact the market

further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus the securities will rank on par with all of the other unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of hsbc except such obligations as may be preferred by operation of law any payment to be made on the securities including any return of principal at maturity depends on the ability of hsbc to satisfy its obligations as they come due as a result the actual and perceived creditworthiness of hsbc may affect the market value of the securities and in the event hsbc were to default on its obligations you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the securities   the amount payable on the securities is not linked to the level of the reference asset at any time other than the final valuation date   the final level will be based on the official closing level of the reference asset on the final valuation date subject to postponement for nontrading days and certain market disruption events even if the level of the reference asset appreciates during the term of the securities other than on the final valuation date but then decreases on the final valuation date to a level that is less than the initial   ps      level the payment at maturity may be less and may be significantly less than it would have been had the payment at maturity been linked to the level of the reference asset prior to such decrease although the actual level of the reference asset on the maturity date or at other times during the term of the securities may be higher than the final level the payment at maturity will be based solely on the official closing level of the reference asset on the final valuation date   the securities will not bear interest   as a holder of the securities you will not receive interest payments   changes that affect the reference asset will affect the market value of the securities and the amount you will receive at maturity   the policies of the reference sponsor concerning

affect the level of the reference asset the policies of the reference sponsor with respect to the calculation of the reference asset could also affect the level of the reference asset the reference sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or dissemination of the reference asset any such actions could affect the value of the securities and the return on the securities   the securities are

guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency or program of the united states or any other jurisdiction an investment in the securities is subject to the credit risk of hsbc and in the event that hsbc is unable to pay its obligations as they become due you may not receive the full payment at maturity of the securities   the estimated initial value of the securities which was determined by us on the pricing date is less than the price to public and may differ from the market value of the securities in the secondary market if any   the estimated initial value of the securities was calculated by us on the pricing date and is less than the price to public the estimated initial value reflects our internal funding rate which is the borrowing rate we use to issue marketlinked securities as well as the midmarket value of the embedded derivatives in the securities this internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities as a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities the estimated initial value of the securities may be lower if it were based on the levels at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market in addition if we were to use the rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances we would expect the economic terms of the securities to be more favorable to you we determined the value of the embedded derivatives in the securities by reference to our or our affiliates’ internal pricing models these pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables which can include volatility and interest rates different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the securities that are different from our estimated initial value these pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events which may prove to be incorrect the estimated initial value does not represent a minimum price at which we or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase your securities in the secondary market if any exists at any time   the price of your securities in the secondary market if any immediately after the pricing date will be less than the price to public   the price to public takes into account certain costs these costs which will be used or retained by us or one of our affiliates include the underwriting discount our affiliates’ projected hedging profits which may or may not be realized for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the securities and the costs associated with structuring and hedging our obligations under the securities if you were to sell your securities in the secondary market if any the price you would receive for your securities may be less than the price you paid for them because secondary market prices will not take into account these costs the price of your securities in the secondary market if any at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors including the price of the reference asset and changes in market conditions and cannot be predicted with accuracy the securities are not designed to be shortterm trading instruments and you should therefore be able and willing to hold the securities to maturity any sale of the securities prior to maturity could result in a loss to you   if we were to repurchase your securities immediately after the original issue date the price you receive may be higher than the estimated initial value of the securities   assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the original issue date the price at which hsbc securities usa inc may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market if any and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements if we provide any customer account statements at all may exceed the estimated initial value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately  months after the original issue date this temporary price difference may exist because in our discretion we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities we will   ps      make such discretionary election and determine this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors including the tenor of the securities and any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities the amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the original issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted   the securities lack liquidity   the securities will not be listed on any securities exchange hsbc securities usa inc is not required to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market if any exists even if there is a secondary market it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities the price at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price if any at which hsbc securities usa inc is willing to buy the securities   potential conflicts of interest may exist   hsbc and its affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities including acting as calculation agent and hedging our obligations under the securities in performing these duties the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities we will not have any obligation to consider your interests as a holder of the securities in taking any action that might affect the value of your securities   uncertain tax treatment   for a discussion of the us federal income tax consequences of your investment

concerning increases or decreases in the level of the reference asset relative to its initial level we cannot predict the actual final level the assumptions we have made in connection with the illustrations set forth below may not reflect actual events and the hypothetical initial level used in the table and examples below is not expected to be the actual initial level you should not take this illustration or these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the reference asset or the return on your securities  the final settlement value may be less than the amount that you would have received from a conventional debt security with the same stated maturity including such a security issued by hsbc the numbers appearing in the table below and following examples have been rounded for ease of analysis   the table below illustrates the final settlement value on a  investment in the securities for a hypothetical range of reference returns from  to  the following results are based solely on the assumptions outlined below the “hypothetical return on the securities” as used below is the number expressed as a percentage that results from comparing the final settlement value per  principal amount of securities to  the potential returns described here assume that your securities are held to maturity you should consider carefully whether the securities are suitable to your investment goals the following table and examples assume the following    principal amount         hypothetical initial level         upside participation rate

calculated with respect to a hypothetical  investment in the securities   example  the level of the reference asset increases from the initial level of  to a final level of        reference return  final settlement value    because the reference return is positive the final settlement value would be  per  principal amount calculated as follows      × reference return × upside participation rate       ×  ×        example  shows that you will receive the return of your principal investment plus a return equal to the reference return multiplied by the upside participation rate when the

as to the proper tax treatment of the securities and therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income

approach pursuant to the terms of the securities you agree to treat the securities under this approach for all us federal income tax purposes subject to the limitations described therein and based on certain factual representations received from us in the opinion of our special us tax counsel morrison  foerster llp it is reasonable to treat a security as a prepaid executory contract with respect to the reference asset pursuant to this approach we do not intend to report any income or gain with respect to the securities prior to their maturity or an earlier sale or exchange and we intend to treat any gain or loss upon maturity or an earlier sale or exchange as longterm capital gain or loss provided that you have held the security for more than one year at such time for us federal income tax purposes   we will not attempt to ascertain whether any of the entities whose stock is included in or owned by the reference asset as the case may be would be treated as a passive foreign

notes   you should read this document together with the prospectus dated april   the prospectus supplement dated july   and the product supplement dated july   you should carefully consider among other things the matters set forth in ”risk factors” beginning on page pr of this document ps of the product supplement and page s of the prospectus supplement as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities we urge you to consult your investment legal tax accounting and other advisers before you invest in the notes   risk factors the following highlights some but not all of the risk considerations relevant to investing in a note investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the reference assets we urge you to read the section “risk factors” beginning on page ps of the product supplement and page s of the prospectus supplement as you review ”risk factors” in the prospectus supplement you should pay particular attention to the following sections   · “— risks relating to all note issuances”   · — additional risks relating to notes with an equity security or equity index as the reference asset    the notes are not principal protected and you may lose some or all of your principal   the principal amount of your investment is not protected and you may receive less and possibly significantly less than the amount you invested you will lose some or all of your principal if both of the following are true a between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive the market price as defined below of the reference asset on any day is below the barrier price and b the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial price of the reference asset a usd investment in the notes will pay usd at maturity if and only if either of the following is true a between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive the market price of the reference asset falls below the barrier price on any day but the final price of the reference asset is equal to or greater than the initial price of the reference asset or b between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive the market price of the reference asset never falls below the barrier price on any day if you receive the physical delivery amount at maturity the market value of the shares of the reference asset you receive will be less than the principal amount of your notes and may be zero accordingly you may lose the entire principal amount of your notes   we cannot predict the final price of any reference asset on the final valuation date    you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the reference asset   you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the reference asset if the final price of the reference asset is greater than the initial price of the reference asset the sum of any interest payments you receive during the term of the notes and the principal payment you receive at maturity will not reflect the performance of the reference asset under no circumstances regardless of the extent to which the value of the reference asset appreciates will your return exceed the applicable interest rate therefore you may earn significantly less by investing in the notes than you would have earned by investing directly in the reference asset    because the tax treatment of the notes is uncertain the material us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are uncertain   there is no direct legal authority as to the proper tax treatment of the notes and therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of your note because of this uncertainty we urge you to consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of your investment in a note for a more complete discussion of the us federal income tax consequences of your investment in a note please see the discussion under ”certain us federal income tax considerations” beginning on page pr of this pricing supplement and ”certain us federal income tax considerations  certain equitylinked notes  certain notes treated as a put option and a deposit” in the prospectus supplement   please note that the prospectus prospectus supplement product supplement and this pricing supplement do not describe all the risks of an investment in the notes we urge you to consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in the notes   summary principal payment at maturity   your payment at maturity for each note you hold will depend on the performance of the reference asset between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive a usd investment in the notes will pay usd at maturity unless a the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial price of the reference asset and b between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive the market price of the reference asset on any day is below the barrier price if the conditions described in a and b are both true at maturity you will receive the physical delivery amount with any fractional shares to be paid in cash in an amount equal to the fractional shares multiplied by the final price under some circumstances to be determined by and at the sole option of hsbc usa inc we may pay investors in lieu of the physical delivery amount the cash equivalent of such shares with a per share price equal to the final price however we currently expect to deliver the physical delivery amount and not cash in lieu of the physical delivery amount in the event the conditions described above occur   pr as described in the product supplement on any scheduled trading day on which the value of the reference asset must be calculated by the calculation agent i if the relevant exchange is the nasdaq stock market “nasdaq” the market price of the reference asset will be the nasdaq official closing price nocp or ii if the nasdaq is not the relevant exchange the market price of the reference asset will be the official closing price of the relevant exchange in each case as of the close of the regular trading session of such exchange and as reported in the official price determination mechanism for such exchange if the reference asset is not listed or traded as described above for any reason other than a market disruption event then the market price for the reference asset on any scheduled trading day will be the average as determined by the calculation agent of the bid prices for the reference asset obtained from as many dealers in the reference asset selected by the calculation agent as will make those bid prices available to the calculation agent the number of dealers need not exceed three and may include the calculation agent or any of its or our affiliates   to the extent a market disruption event exists on a day on which the final price is to be determined the market price of the reference asset will be determined on the first following scheduled trading day on which a market disruption event does not exist with respect to the reference asset provided that if a market disruption event exists on five consecutive scheduled trading days that fifth scheduled trading day shall be the final valuation date and the calculation agent shall determine the final price on such date   in the event that the maturity date is postponed or extended as described under ”specific terms of the notes  maturity date” in the product supplement the related payment of principal will be made on the postponed or extended maturity date   you may lose some or all of your principal if you invest in the notes   physical delivery amount   if the payment at maturity is in physical shares of the reference asset you will receive a number of shares referred to as the ”physical delivery amount” with any fractional shares to be paid in cash the physical delivery amount will be calculated by the calculation agent by dividing the principal amount of your notes by the initial price of the reference asset the physical delivery amount the initial price of the reference asset and other amounts may change due to corporate actions   interest   the notes will pay interest at the interest rate specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement and interest payments will be made on the interest payment dates specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement however if the first interest payment date is less than  days after the date of issuance interest will not be paid on the first interest payment date but will be paid on the second interest payment date interest will be computed on the basis of a day year of twelve day months for more information see ”description of the notes  fixed rate notes” in the prospectus supplement   certain us federal income tax considerations you should carefully consider among other things the matters set forth in “certain us federal income tax considerations” in the prospectus supplement in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp special us tax counsel to us the following discussion summarizes certain of the material us federal income tax consequences of the purchase beneficial ownership and disposition of each of the notes   there are no regulations published rulings or judicial decisions addressing the characterization for us federal income tax purposes of securities with terms that are substantially the same as those of the notes under one approach each note should be treated for federal income tax purposes as a put option written by you the “put option” that permits us to  sell the reference asset to you at the maturity date for an amount equal to the deposit as defined below or  “cash settle” the put option ie require you to pay us at the maturity date the difference between the deposit and the value of the reference asset at such time and a deposit with us of cash in an amount equal to the principal amount you invested the “deposit” to secure your potential obligation under the put option we intend to treat the notes consistent with this approach pursuant to the terms of the notes you agree to treat the notes as cash deposits and put options with respect to the reference asset for all us federal income tax purposes we also intend to treat the deposits as “shortterm obligations” for us federal income tax purposes please see the discussion under the heading “certain us federal income tax considerations — us federal income tax treatment of the notes as indebtedness for us federal income tax purposesshortterm debt instruments” in the prospectus supplement for certain us federal income tax considerations applicable to shortterm obligations however because under certain circumstances notes with an initial maturity of one year may be outstanding for more than one year it is possible that the deposits associated with these notes may not be treated as shortterm obligations in that event notes with an initial maturity of one year would be described in “certain us federal income tax considerations  us federal income tax treatment of the notes as indebtedness for us federal income tax purposes  payments of interest” in the prospectus supplement   the description below of each reference asset includes a chart that indicates the yield on the deposit and the put premium as described in the prospectus supplement under the heading “certain us federal income tax considerations — certain equitylinked notes— certain notes treated as a put option and a deposit” if the internal revenue service the “irs” were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the notes the timing and character of income on the notes might differ we do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding the tax treatment of the notes and the irs or a court may not agree with the tax treatment described in this pricing supplement   pr   reference issuer and reference asset information all information on the reference assets and the reference issuers is derived from

forth to the extent available the quarterly high and low intraday prices as well as endofquarter closing prices of that reference asset for each quarter in the period from january   through march

below of each reference asset includes a table of hypothetical returns that is based on the assumptions outlined for each reference asset each table illustrates the hypothetical returns you would have earned from i a usd investment in the notes compared to ii a direct investment in the relevant reference asset prior to the deduction of any applicable brokerage fees or charges the following is a general description of how the hypothetical returns in each table were determined   ·     if the final price of the reference asset is greater than or equal to the initial price of the reference asset you would receive usd at maturity regardless of whether the market price of the reference asset on any day was below the barrier price ·     if the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial price of the reference asset but the market price of the reference asset was not below the barrier price on any day between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive you would receive usd at maturity or ·     if the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial price of the reference asset and the market price of the reference asset was below the barrier price on any day between the initial valuation date and the final valuation date inclusive you would receive the physical delivery amount with any fractional shares to be paid in cash   each table of hypothetical returns is provided for illustration purposes only and is hypothetical none purports to be representative of every possible scenario concerning increases or decreases in the price of the reference asset and the payment at maturity of the notes we cannot predict the final price of the reference assets on the final valuation date the assumptions we have made in connection
