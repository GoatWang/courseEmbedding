handlair® is unmatched in the grain vac industry unlike most grain vacs which are limited to truck loading a handlair can fill tall bins silos and flat storage transfer grain over long distances several hundred feet and gently handle seed grains – all while using lightweight ″ to ″ piping that makes setup operation and takedown a breeze developed and built for years of service in the heart of usa’s corn and soybean country handlair continues to set performance standards for grain vacs if you’re looking for a better way to move your grain and seed you can count on handlair modelsfeatures and optionspiping and assessoriesparts service  supporthandlair brochuresafetymodels models           more seed companies own a handlair than all others put together when it comes to grain handling damage seed companies are a demanding group they’re very fussy about their seed handling equipment because seed handling damage costs them money – big money handlair revolutionized the seed industry by becoming the first pneumatic conveyor to pass test after test for handling damage – proving itself as the seed mover of choice for leading seed companies everywhere make sure you look under the hood the two primary components of all pushpull pneumatic conveyors are the airlock and blower the quality and design of these two components significantly impacts the performance service life and value of a grain vac for example handlair’s heavyduty cast blowthrough airlock with adjustable steel tips will keep operating when others plug or underperform as each rotor pocket containing grain passes in front of the blower’s discharge the pocket is cleaned from the pressurized air passing directly through it – hence the term “blowthrough airlock” this results in higher conveying efficiency and better performance the handlair positive displacement blower with hardened gears highquality bearings and seals can operate at pressures  higher providing unequaled conveying performance model

reporting digital marketing or just want to meet other publishers head on over to sovrn community   learn more by sovrn holdings we have put together a blog series leading up to our i² event in september that is tailored to capture thoughtprovoking ideas and commentary from visionaries publishing leaders independents evangelists and the like everyday we have the pleasure of engaging with experts and innovators blazing their own path in the industry and we thought this would be the ideal time to open up and share these discussions to start we are asking our i² event sponsors speakers attendees and industry leaders questions about the future of indie publishing we hope you enjoy the seriesthe first post is a qa with ethan holien ceo of handllwhat’s your advice to independent publishers who want to better monetize their passion of publishing you work hard on your content but you can produce only so much of it social networks have a huge amount of authentic content that fits your site and your audience will love using social networks as a source of content rather than just a source of incoming traffic can multiply your efforts and offer new additive monetizationwhat do you see as the future of indie publishing content will continue to be consumed across a variety of rich platforms including social networks and aggregation apps to compete in the future indie publishers will use tools that enrich their own sites and apps with realtime dynamic content concurrently tools that help to control the distribution and monetization of content wherever it is consumed will become increasingly importantwhat’s broken in publishing today social networks are quickly becoming like aol in  – walled gardens that control consumption and distribution of content some people even behave like social networks are all that matters the fix to this situation is greater integration of content both ways – social network content on publisher’s properties in a way that works for social networks and publisher content on social networks in a way that works for publisherswhat does the independent web mean to you the independent web is a place where people can both express themselves and build a business it is inseparable from a free democratic and capitalist society okay yes a big statement but this is serious stuff let’s keep the web independentwant to learn
