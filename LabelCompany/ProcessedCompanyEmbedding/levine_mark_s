started from page  and worried about the ambiguity of the chord notation being a pop rock folkclassicaltype player i feared not being able to navigate the book because of this what is g to a jazz person it is not explained it seems does it use the b natural or the b flat can one of the four notes even the root be eliminated and it is still called a g in jazz why does levine say voicings are the same as chords in jazz to me they are entirely different conceptsbut i did not get discouragedi went on to play the different twochord combinations created from various of the masters of jazz and taken from their songs wherein halfsteps down and halfsteps up were being illustratedi went into ecstasy my baldwin acrosonic became a supersized jazz vehicle immediatelyfor each combination i wrote down the basic chords that they were related to as i knew it for example the first such two halfstepmelodied chords in my poprockfolkclassical way of thinking were simply jacked up or jazzedup versions of g by which i mean a chord with g b d and f in it in any position moving to c major or perhaps d diminished moving to c major in the end the chord combination by bob haggart from his whats new is first an f diminished with the note e added followed by a c without the root note c  both carefully voiced in my words using two handsi guess the bass player plays the note c here rightso far  this approach has worked for me i am not playing the exercises rote i am understanding the simpler versions of chords from which they are derived the chord of my old world of music i write this down then i write down what the given sheet music is chords without burdening myself by also writing the voicings down since they are already in the sheet music given by levine then i notice how perturbing and voicing the simpler chords yields the jazzedup chordsthis way it all makes sense i am thrilled to tie my new world of jazz at least so far to my old world of shall we say more standard musici have a teacher but hes like us alleccentric in this case hard to nail down for lessons im listening to jazz ill see how far i can go but i wont drop my pop country beatles rock ballads boobiewoogie and other styles at all ill try to simply hahnot simple add jazz to my listso far then i am grateful for this stairway to jazz and i thank mark the lingo seems loose and variable after all the jazz pros probably grunt anything they can to one another about where in general to go next and somehow those grunts are seen as formal terms or they may write down fake sheets in any notation that makes sense

there was a problem loading comments right now please try again later out of  starsyou cant get everything with a shapeshifting artbyd jensenon may  format kindle editionverified purchaseit seems by glancing through some of the reviews for levines book one would get the impression that its a rather cold and ultimately unrewarding travel through chord changes and extensions but that is a rather perfunctory view on this interesting approach that levines taken first of all youve got to give the guy credit for presenting his opinion that jazz theory is a bit of an oxymoron given the subjective nature of the music itself he clearly tells you that experiencing the music itself is of utmost importance this is simultaneously the most repeated and most ignored piece of advice that musicians pedagogues and listeners seem to throw out there without really having the listener embrace this important idea for instance when one becomes interested in a certain form of blues jazz pop european or eastern music there really is no substitute for digging through and gathering the tunes that drew you to the form in the first place levines approach may accentuate the post bud powell form of jazz but with the extremely unorthodox shape of the book you can use it as a template to be used over many different idioms his grasp of this slippery subject is extremely solid and more than anything else prepares aspiring players for delving into different idioms without hitting some of the roadblocks one may find by simply getting into a more general learn to play xstyle collection or cdbook combination that seems to be the preferred quick fix for many for example i have often recommended to students the homespun series by dr john covering new orleans rhythm and blues where theyre able to really get the feel of the music not just licks a term i avoid at all costs although the immediate satisfaction that one gets from reading through a transcription and then hearing themselves playing it at least keeps there interest intact but just like levines book clearly states there really is no substitute for the music itself so why not have a book about the subject that clearly provides the effect that a book can provide text and theory about the music that also encourages the player to really immerse himherself into the music whichever style he or she prefersunconventional layout that yes requires patience but in what seems at first jumping ahead then back again only to make the subject notice that difficulties havent reared their head later when trying to fit together the various ideas combined within this is invaluable you just cant beat that approach save sitting with a professional on a bench where practical ideas can be fleshed out for you all students cant have their hands held constantlymake sure your record collection is healthy or you have the means to do so levine doesnt pull any punches when emphasizing this and frankly really shouldntits a little trial by fire but just use your head and youll benefit greatly from thiscomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web

spiralboundverified purchasemusic theory can be a confusing subject especially for improvising musicians this book clears that confusion and is perhaps the most practical tome on the subject i have ever seenalthough it is primarily for pianists the melodic examples apply to all instrumentsas a guitarist i benefited greatly from ted greens books even more from personal lessons with him teds works are wonderful but are mostly instrument specific books this book is really about harmony  the useful part of music theory so it applies to all instruments even if you are a guitarist or play any monophonic instrument you will get many ideas from this bookmark levine  the author is obviously a person of experience and this work demonstrates his practical understanding of music theory as it is really used by professional musicians he provides many examples from jazzstandards that illustrate each idea he wastes no time justifying statements or elaborating esoteric bs every page uncovers a world of practice possibilities yet the organization of the books chapters makes progress seem smooth almost effortlessyou must be able to read music  at least a little  to get the most from this volume however even some of my students who do not read at all have benefitted from reading itpractice is the key knowledge is nothing without practice if for no other reason than marks practical advice on how to practice this book is worth the moneyi recently purchased another copy of this book for a student who had to quit taking lessons because she had a baby the service i got from amazon was fast the book arrived in perfect conditionafter rereading the book i am almost shocked at how much of my theoryteaching style is borrowed from this book even after twenty years of using the information here i still get something useful every time i open itthis is a truly great work on the subject this will be the fifth copy i have purchased and gifted to others i cannot recommend it
