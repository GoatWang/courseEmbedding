analytics longshort equitymarketplacedistressed value investingsummarytaseko has received approval for exploratory work at new prosperity under the outgoing bc governmentthe new bc government is likely to be less favorable to new prosperity though and it still faces challenges at the federal levelhigher copper prices are benefiting taseko although  offset by the stronger canadian dollartaseko appears to be worth around  usd to  usd at current copper pricestaseko mines tgb recently received approval for exploratory work at new prosperity however i believe that approval of new prosperity as a producing mine will likely only happen with a court order as a result the value of new prosperity should be still mostly discounted when looking at taseko tasekos stock is now also benefiting from higher copper prices and the removal of the refinancing uncertainty although it is also somewhat hurt by a stronger canadian dollar new prosperity remains a question mark although taseko has received provincial approval to do exploration work at new prosperity i do not believe that its chances of becoming a mine have improved the provincial approval was granted by the outgoing government and the new government is a leftwing ndpgreen party coalition that seems unlikely to support further development at new prosperity as well new prosperity previously failed to get federal approval under a conservative government and thus seems challenged to receive federal approval under the current liberal government despite some changes to new prosperitys plan taseko is also trying to get new prosperity approved through the courts while i am not qualified to judge the chances of success through that route the chances of government approval seem near zero so a court order is probably tasekos best chance for new prosperity copper prices and exchange rates copper prices have recently improved significantly as supply continues to be disrupted by strikes and chinas economy has been doing better than expected as well reports indicate that china may ban imports of copper scrap metal by the end of  which would lead to increased demand for refined copper imports this has pushed copper up to around  usd per pound the highest it has been since early  the effect of higher copper prices on taseko is significantly offset around  offset during the last month by a stronger canadian dollar though positive canadian economic news and a rate hike have contributed to the value of the canadian dollar increasing by close to  versus the us dollar over the last several months as a result the price of copper in canadian dollars remains fairly similar to where it has been since late  a contrast to the large movement of copper prices in us dollars source infomine it appears that taseko can make around  usd per pound in gross margins using gibraltars mine average copper grade and the current usdcad exchange rate this translates into approximately  million usd in ebitda with  million pounds of annual copper production  share conclusion tasekos situation has improved noticeably over the past few months with its successful debt refinancing and now higher copper prices tasekos share price is largely correlated to copper prices and it appears that it is now worth approximately  usd to  usd per share assuming that current copper prices around  usd per pound hold tasekos share price in us dollars has benefited more than its share price in canadian dollars traded on the tse due to the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar despite the positive news for taseko of receiving exploration work approval at new prosperity i think that it is still unlikely that it receives full approval new prosperity has failed to gain approval before and now both the federal and provincial governments are to the left of the former governments authors note if you thought this article was interesting please scroll to the top of the article and click follow next to elephant

as a way to give back to the communities that they call homejoseph  rosalie segal family health centre in july  taseko made a  million commitment to the building of a new mental health facility at vancouver general hospital the largest corporate contribution to mental health in the drive to make the joseph  rosalie segal family health centre a reality the funding to be provided over the course of three years will aid vgh in building a new stateoftheart facility which will provide a therapeutic and healing environment for patients from across the province the current facility is  years old worn out and in desperate need of replacement “taseko’s operations are exclusively british columbia based we have over  people and their families living in the province primarily in williams lake and the cariboo region and although this new facility will exist in vancouver it will be available to improve the lives of british columbians regardless of where they live that is important to us we are proud to make this contribution to mental health care and recovery on behalf of our employees and shareholders” says taseko’s president and ceo russell hallbauerother initiativescombined the list of

breaking rocks is a key part of the production process a new technology promises to stir things up by cutting energy improving quality and reducing costs its called stirred mill technology recently implemented by taseko mines limited in the regrind circuit at its gibraltar mine in south central bc for its conservation efforts taseko has been selected as a power smart excellence awards finalist an energyefficient grind stirred mills have been shown to use as little as twothirds of the energy of conventional grinding equipment the difference lies in the way that the stirred mill agitates the grinding media steel balls and rock to reduce the size of the rock particles conventional ball mills rotate the mill body a horizontal cylinder tumbling the rock with steel balls that break up the rock in stirred mills the mill body is stationary the steel balls and rock are agitated by an internal auger that causes the contents to circulate reducing the size of the rock particles stirred mill technology was developed in australia and has been in use for a number of years but had not been adopted in bc its a commercially available technology that has no market penetration in bc says markus zeller an industrial technology innovation manager with bc hydro how power smart helped that meant that the installation of the stirred mill at gibraltar qualified for support under power smarts conservation technology innovation program  the program also supports nearcommercial technologies that are developed in bc the program provided technical support and engineering analysis to quantify the energy savings of the installation with the technology now being used in bc we can get better insights into its performance says zeller for any mine thats expanding or being built new we can now offer this as a proven energyefficient technology where we have a little more knowledge of how it behaves and how it works it lets us validate the energy savings so we can transfer that knowledge to other sites or other applications annual savings  its estimated that the stirred grinding mill at gibraltar will save  gigawatt hours gwh of electricity annually at the tier  rate for bc hydros transmission customers thats a savings of  per year for the mine the total provincial potential for energy savings through the use of stirred mills in regrinding a second stage grinding circuit where minerals collected in the first stages of the process are further reduced in size to allow physical separation into final product is  to  gwh per year a better product too the energy saving potential is impressive but it is not the only reasons to shift to stirred mill technology you get a more consistent product out of a stirred mill than a ball mill says zeller further the stirred mill has the potential to achieve finer grind sizes than a conventional ball mill which can offer downstream benefits to separate out the copper or whatever else youre looking for the stirred mill also requires less floor space and is simple to install and maintain its almost a nobrainer he adds if a mine is expanding this technology requires low additional capital provides annual savings and gives a better grind capturing all those benefits is important in ensuring the future competitiveness of the bc mining industry says bc hydro industrial marketing manager steve quon mining is bcs second largest industrial consumer of electricity after the pulp and paper industry using  of all purchased industrial electricity efficiency innovation is critical in the mining sector because the products that we produce are cyclical in nature says quon the market prices will go up and down but if you have energy efficient processes youre able to weather the ups and downs a lot more capably than your
