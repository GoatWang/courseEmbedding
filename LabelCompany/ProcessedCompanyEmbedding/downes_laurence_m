distributed generation toggle navigation product showcase news  community news  may   new jersey resources ceo testifies before us senate on benefits of distributed generation laurence m downes — chairman and ceo of new jersey resources corp and chairman of the distributed power coalition of america dpca — testified at a us senate hearing addressing the impact of distributed generation on natural gas demand few innovations offer as much promise for american consumers as distributed generation said mr downes the benefits of employing small dispersed generation units throughout the electric grid include more choices for consumers increased reliability improved power quality additional capacity to support the nations power grid fewer harmful air emissions in my opinion distributed generation has the potential to change the electric industry in much the same way as pcs changed the computer business distributed generation technologies provide consumers with an alternative to traditional electric power the equipment can be installed at a customers home or business and electricity is produced onsite since many of the distributed generation technologies use natural gas to fuel the power generation process natural gas distribution companies have the opportunity to expand their natural gas sales about dcpa the distributed power coalition of america is a national group comprised of over  organizations dedicated to the development of a vibrant market for distributed generation and has been actively involved in both federal and state initiatives that address distributed generation technology editors note it amazes me that for the past thirty years or so large electric utility companies spent millions of dollars convincing federal state and local governments that economy of scale was the correct way to save millions of dollars — a small number of large output generation distributed generation is almost the exact opposite of this philosophy — more and more small capacity generation plants edited by jerry r borland pe like what you are reading sign up for our free newsletter sign me up by clicking sign me up you agree to our terms and that
