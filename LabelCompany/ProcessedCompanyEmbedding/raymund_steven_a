reseller news   address tech data corporation  tech data drive clearwater florida  httpwwwtech datacom ■ in  steven a raymund was the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the clearwater florida–based tech data corporation one of the industrys leading providers of information technology it products logistics management and other valueadded services when raymunds father edward founded the business in  it was called a pick pack and ship operation raymund developed that small company from a employee millioninsales business to a employee integrated supplychain specialist worth over  billion and depended on by technology manufacturers and sellers worldwide for outsourcing materials during his twodecadesplus association with tech data raymund developed and expanded the companys contributions to such essential industry services as technical support education and custom configuration while at the same time expanding into international markets across the globe computer gadget dealer edward c raymund stevens father founded tech data in  although its original purpose was to market dataprocessing supplies directly to end users of miniature and mainframe computers the company expanded its markets in  redirecting efforts toward serving microcomputer resellers as a wholesale distributor tech data remained a small organization during its first decade of operations employing about a dozen people who handled all customer orders from a small office and warehouse building in clearwater florida the elder raymund credited his son steven with expanding distribution well beyond its modest beginnings in —thanks to the younger raymunds drive intelligence and abilities—tech data was the worlds secondlargest distributor of computerrelated products behind ingram micro tech data provided more than  different items to more than  resellers in about  countries in north america the caribbean latin america europe and the middle east its extensive catalog of products and services included computer components such as keyboards disk drives and video cards networking equipment such as routers and bridges peripherals such as modems printers and monitors software pre and postsale training technical support configuration and assembly services ecommerce solutions and financing options the company distributed products from about one thousand manufacturers tech data added to its international operations in early  with the acquisition of the united kingdoms azlan group sales were then evenly divided between europe and the united states cleaning up before college raymund was employed as a janitor at the pasadena elementary school in california while taking a year off between high school and college he was able to finish his duties in half of the time needed and so was left with plenty of time to read and study the janitorial job earned him enough money to travel to europe and parts of the middle east which gave him an urge to do further international traveling with regard to his professional life raymund decided that picking up trash and cleaning up after children was not what he wanted to do he decided to attend college to learn a better profession college and early career raymund completed his undergraduate work at the university of oregon in eugene in  earning a bachelors degree in economics he went on to earn a masters degree in international politics in  from georgetown universitys school of foreign service in washington dc after graduation raymund found a job with the manufacturers hanover corporation in the financial district of new york city after a short time raymund realized he was one of about two thousand employees who had masters degrees in business administration within the company he did not think he would be able to develop his full potential in such an environment he quit the wall street job and returned home to florida—unemployed and with no career plans raymunds father had started tech data a few years earlier and offered him the chance to develop a new retail catalog for the companys rapidly growing telemarketing department believing that he would accomplish this task in a couple of months and then look for another job elsewhere raymund took the offer during his first few months at the new job raymund also assisted in other areas of the company that needed help at that time somewhat suddenly several members of upper management left for promising jobs at a local competitor—taking with them the majority of the business and product lines developed at tech data seeing the companys business cut to onefourth of its previous months revenues the younger raymund made a bold move he convinced his father to begin selling products within the fledgling personal computer pc market that ibm and apple had recently introduced he also made a commitment to stay on at tech data just your average guy with  employees who were as committed to the struggling company as the owner and his son the younger raymund expanded the company with handson techniques those employees remembered raymund as being just your average guy who was learning the business in the same fashion as they were doing one of the important ingredients in tech datas early success was raymunds ability to surround himself with smart people who could teach him the pc business he was known as a good learner and teacher who was very curious about all sorts of things most importantly the employees did not construe his inquisitiveness as being intrusive the comradeship formed during those early years continued into the s recognizing trends and improving processes before orders were made electronically tech datas sales associates placed completed order forms in baskets that would be periodically picked up by the distribution department as an example of raymunds curious nature he would go through the piles several times a day in order to recognize sale trends this desire for knowledge helped tech data stay on top of the drastically changing computer industry as it grew during those infant years later when the company was fully computerized raymund helped to pioneer the creation of colocation—that is the procedure of shipping products to end users directly from a manufacturers plant—a process that was eventually called integrated distribution trusted partnerships formed when raymund became tech datas operations manager his father went around the country in search of distribution contracts with vendors and further business with small resellers both men saw that rival distributors were aiming at large resellers and members of the emerging retail market thus in small resellers they found an important and often overlooked niche early in the development of the industry during this period the senior raymund instilled a sense of partnership with tech datas suppliers a sense that was not ordinarily present when companies did business with suppliers this sense of partnership would remain an important aspect of the younger raymunds dealings with suppliers going public the younger raymund directed the company to expand its sales of computer supplies such as computer monitors printers addon cards and other accessories new to the burgeoning pc market he quickly realized that dealing with computer supplies garnered great profits for the company tech data grossed  million in sales in  that number tripled to  million in just two years a huge jump in gross sales in  of  million was nothing compared to the continued climb of  million in —the year raymund took tech data public on the nasdaq stock market expansion worldwide raymund expertly molded successful operations at tech data by using a steady internalgrowth model after becoming convinced that the company had solid consistent performance in the united states raymund ventured into the rest of the world raymund expanded tech data operations into canada in  and founded an export division in miami florida in early  to serve the computer market of south america he entered the european market in  through the acquisition of the paris france–based softmart international which was frances largest distributor of pc products in  raymund opened a distribution center in são paulo brazil—tech datas first center in south america in  raymund acquired a majority interest in the munich germany–based computer  europes foremost provider of it products to resellers the purchase gave tech data direction into the countries of the middle east through the companys office in the united arab emirates and into the south american markets of argentina chile peru and uruguay in  raymund acquired globelle canada doubling tech datas presence in the country and giving it an office in israel through an existing subsidiary that year tech datas revenue grew to  billion from the  billion of a year earlier while much of this growth resulted from the german acquisition us sales also grew  percent in  expansion into new markets while expanding tech data geographically through various acquisitions raymund also delved into new market segments the companys original base was valueadded resellers vars corporate resellers and franchisees raymund added to this base so that by  tech data served more than  customers including application service providers internet service providers vars corporate resellers systems integrators system builders government resellers exporters retailers direct marketers catalogers and web resellers raymund also developed many other specialized programs and business units to serve specialty niches thought highly of even tech datas competitors thought highly of raymund as reported by computer reseller news jerre stead the chairman of the santa ana california–based

the guys who is a thinker and who brings an awful lot of intellect to the whole industry is steve raymund he looks beyond daytoday and he has a lot of vision hes steered tech data into the success it has realized the thinker raymund was described as a methodical executor in his business dealings with other companies he was mildmannered reserved and cerebral—a thinker who carefully selected the words he was about to say raymund was an excellent negotiator as was his father always looking for the winwin situation a laserlike focus in all facets of his life and attention to detail were other wellknown raymund traits yet he realized that facts and figures were not the only important concepts for a successful business he also relied on intuition to play a critical role in building

industry computer reseller news – industry hall of fame computer reseller news  address tech data corporation  tech data drive clearwater florida  httpwwwtech datacom ■ in  steven a raymund was the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the clearwater florida–based tech data corporation one of the industrys leading providers of information technology it products logistics management and other valueadded services when raymunds father edward founded the business in  it was called a pick pack and ship operation raymund developed that small company from a employee millioninsales business to a employee integrated supplychain specialist worth over  billion and depended on by technology manufacturers and sellers worldwide for outsourcing materials during his twodecadesplus association with tech data raymund developed and expanded the companys contributions to such essential industry services as technical support education and custom configuration while at the same time expanding into international markets across the globe computer gadget dealer edward c raymund stevens father founded tech data in  although its original purpose was to market dataprocessing supplies directly to end users of miniature and mainframe computers the company expanded its markets in  redirecting efforts toward serving microcomputer resellers as a wholesale distributor tech data remained a small organization during its first decade of operations employing about a dozen people who handled all customer orders from a small office and warehouse building in clearwater florida the elder raymund credited his son steven with expanding distribution well beyond its modest beginnings in —thanks to the younger raymunds drive intelligence and abilities—tech data was the worlds secondlargest distributor of computerrelated products behind ingram micro tech data provided more than  different items to more than  resellers in about  countries in north america the caribbean latin america europe and the middle east its extensive catalog of products and services included computer components such as keyboards disk drives and video cards networking equipment such as routers and bridges peripherals such as modems printers and monitors software pre and postsale training technical support configuration and assembly services ecommerce solutions and financing options the company distributed products from about one thousand manufacturers tech data added to its international operations in early  with the acquisition of the united kingdoms azlan group sales were then evenly divided between europe and the united states cleaning up before college raymund was employed as a janitor at the pasadena elementary school in california while taking a year off between high school and college he was able to finish his duties in half of the time needed and so was left with plenty of time to read and study the janitorial job earned him enough money to travel to europe and parts of the middle east which gave him an urge to do further international traveling with regard to his professional life raymund decided that picking up trash and cleaning up after children was not what he wanted to do he decided to attend college to learn a better profession college and early career raymund completed his undergraduate work at the university of oregon in eugene in  earning a bachelors degree in economics he went on to earn a masters degree in international politics in  from georgetown universitys school of foreign service in washington dc after graduation raymund found a job with the manufacturers hanover corporation in the financial district of new york city after a short time raymund realized he was one of about two thousand employees who had masters degrees in business administration within the company he did not think he would be able to develop his full potential in such an environment he quit the wall street job and returned home to florida—unemployed and with no career plans raymunds father had started tech data a few years earlier and offered him the chance to develop a new retail catalog for the companys rapidly growing telemarketing department believing that he would accomplish this task in a couple of months and then look for another job elsewhere raymund took the offer during his first few months at the new job raymund also assisted in other areas of the company that needed help at that time somewhat suddenly several members of upper management left for promising jobs at a local competitor—taking with them the majority of the business and product lines developed at tech data seeing the companys business cut to onefourth of its previous months revenues the younger raymund made a bold move he convinced his father to begin selling products within the fledgling personal computer pc market that ibm and apple had recently introduced he also made a commitment to stay on at tech data just your average guy with  employees who were as committed to the struggling company as the owner and his son the younger raymund expanded the company with handson techniques those employees remembered raymund as being just your average guy who was learning the business in the same fashion as they were doing one of the important ingredients in tech datas early success was raymunds ability to surround himself with smart people who could teach him the pc business he was known as a good learner and teacher who was very curious about all sorts of things most importantly the employees did not construe his inquisitiveness as being intrusive the comradeship formed during those early years continued into the s recognizing trends and improving processes before orders were made electronically tech datas sales associates placed completed order forms in baskets that would be periodically picked up by the distribution department as an example of raymunds curious nature he would go through the piles several times a day in order to recognize sale trends this desire for knowledge helped tech data stay on top of the drastically changing computer industry as it grew during those infant years later when the company was fully computerized raymund helped to pioneer the creation of colocation—that is the procedure of shipping products to end users directly from a manufacturers plant—a process that was eventually called integrated distribution trusted partnerships formed when raymund became tech datas operations manager his father went around the country in search of distribution contracts with vendors and further business with small resellers both men saw that rival distributors were aiming at large resellers and members of the emerging retail market thus in small resellers they found an important and often overlooked niche early in the development of the industry during this period the senior raymund instilled a sense of partnership with tech datas suppliers a sense that was not ordinarily present when companies did business with suppliers this sense of partnership would remain an important aspect of the younger raymunds dealings with suppliers going public the younger raymund directed the company to expand its sales of computer supplies such as computer monitors printers addon cards and other accessories new to the burgeoning pc market he quickly realized that dealing with computer supplies garnered great profits for the company tech data grossed  million in sales in  that number tripled to  million in just two years a huge jump in gross sales in  of  million was nothing compared to the continued climb of  million in —the year raymund took tech data public on the nasdaq stock market expansion worldwide raymund expertly molded successful operations at tech data by using a steady internalgrowth model after becoming convinced that the company had solid consistent performance in the united states raymund ventured into the rest of the world raymund expanded tech data operations into canada in  and founded an export division in miami florida in early  to serve the computer market of south america he entered the european market in  through the acquisition of the paris france–based softmart international which was frances largest distributor of pc products in  raymund opened a distribution center in são paulo brazil—tech datas first center in south america in  raymund acquired a majority interest in the munich germany–based computer  europes foremost provider of it products to resellers the purchase gave tech data direction into the countries of the middle east through the companys office in the united arab emirates and into the south american markets of argentina chile peru and uruguay in  raymund acquired globelle canada doubling tech datas presence in the country and giving it an office in israel through an existing subsidiary that year tech datas revenue grew to  billion from the  billion of a year earlier while much of this growth resulted from the german acquisition us sales also grew  percent in  expansion into new markets while expanding tech data geographically through various acquisitions raymund also delved into new market segments the companys original base was valueadded resellers vars corporate resellers and franchisees raymund added to this base so that by  tech data served more than  customers including application service providers internet service providers vars corporate resellers systems integrators system builders government resellers exporters retailers direct marketers catalogers and web resellers raymund also developed many other specialized programs and business units to serve specialty niches thought highly of even tech datas competitors thought highly of raymund as reported by computer reseller news jerre stead the chairman of the santa ana california–based ingram micro said of archrival raymund steve is a very good leader a strategic thinker and he does a great job making sure tech data is focusing on infrastructure raymund was also known in the vendor community as a person who helped to shape the industry dave boucher the general manager of the armonk new york–based advanced fulfillment initiative which was part of ibm corporation remarked one of the guys who is a thinker and who brings an awful lot of intellect to the whole industry is steve raymund he looks beyond daytoday and he has a lot of vision hes steered tech data into the success it has realized the thinker raymund was described as a methodical executor in his business dealings with other companies he was mildmannered reserved and cerebral—a thinker who carefully selected the words he was about to say raymund was an excellent negotiator as was his father always looking for the winwin situation a laserlike focus in all facets of his life and attention to detail were other wellknown raymund traits yet he realized that facts and figures were not the only important concepts for a successful business he also relied on intuition to play a critical role in building successful management teams serving with distinction raymund was a member of the board of directors for jabil circuit the electronics manufacturingservices provider where he served as chairman of the audit committee he was inducted into the computer reseller newss hall of fame in  two years after his father was inducted raymund was named one of the  most influential executives in the pc industry as compiled by computer reseller news each year from  through  raymund was inducted into the tampa bay florida
