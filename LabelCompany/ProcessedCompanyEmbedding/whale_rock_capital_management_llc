best opportunities for wealth creation while reducing risk while technology is subject to rapid change and extreme competition our focus on understanding technology adoption cycles and identifying companies with very strong competitive advantages is key while many are focused on near term results we seek to identify longterm underappreciated earnings power which often allows us to invest in great companies at attractive valuations we are looking for three key drivers to our investments product cycle identify powerful new trends product cycles and themes and map them to the s–curve when technologies hit the mainstream they inflect up the curve creating several years of rapid and predictable growth competitiveadvantage evaluate the companies exposed to the trend focusing on strong competitive advantages while tmt can be extremely competitive sometimes companies emerge with very wide moats underappreciated earnings power scurve  competitive advantage drives exponential earnings
