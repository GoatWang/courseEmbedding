respondents offer the commission finds that summary  rs a san francisco bay area investment adviser entered into undisclosed arrangements allowing selected investors  typically highdollar value investors  to engage in excessive trading prohibited by the mutual funds prospectus these select investors reaped millions of dollars in excess profits while rs earned approximately  million in additional fees as a result of the special trading arrangements  rs allowed at least five investors to engage in frequent short term trading in substantial dollar amounts in some instances rs allowed this trading simultaneously with the clients agreement to place longterm also known as sticky assets in the rs funds for example in  rs  with the approval of its ceo and cfo  entered into an agreement with one of its largest investors allowing the investor to make unlimited trades in rss largest mutual fund notwithstanding a provision in the prospectus limiting investors to four exchanges per year at the same time the investor agreed to deposit  million in longterm assets into the same mutual fund generating approximately  in management fees for rs  respondents never disclosed to the funds board of trustees or rs shareholders that the firm only selectively enforced the exchange provisions set forth in the funds prospectus nor did they disclose the potential conflict of interest created when the firm allowed some investors to trade in excess of the prospectuss exchange provision while simultaneously investing longterm assets  by virtue of the activities alleged herein rs willfully violated sections  and  of the advisers act and sections d and b of the investment company act and rule d thereunder cohen caused and willfully aided and abetted rss violations of sections  and  of

trading policies and practices  rs is the investment adviser to the ten funds the funds are equity funds with approximately  billion in assets under management as of december   between  and december   the funds also included a money market fund during this period the fund with the highest asset value was consistently the egf with approximately  billion in assets under management as of december    from at least  through mid the ten equity funds issued a single prospectus to potential investors the money market fund had its own prospectus both prospectuses expressly limited the number of exchanges an investor could make in and out of the funds during the relevant time period the funds prospectus made the following disclosure exchanges shares of one fund may be exchanged for shares of another fund� however you may not exchange your investment more than four times in any month period including the initial exchange of your investment from that fund during the period and subsequent exchanges of that investment from other funds or the rs money market fund during the same month period the prospectus further disclosed that exchange privileges may be terminated modified or suspended by a fund upon  days prior notice to shareholders the money market fund prospectus also limited shareholders to four exchanges per  months hecht and cohen signed the rs investment trusts registration statements which incorporated the prospectuses for the years  through   notwithstanding the language in the prospectuses rs had no consistent policy with regard to shareholders who exceeded the exchange limit while rs did not stringently enforce the fourexchange limitation the firm during the relevant period took action against some customers who were excessively trading in the funds such actions were usually taken against customers engaged in market timing the practice of frequently buying and selling shares of the same fund in part to exploit potential inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing  the words market timing did not appear in the rs prospectuses however on certain occasions rs admonished investors to discontinue their market timing activities and stated that market timing was not permitted in its funds for example in february  rss sales department informed several investors that our firms policy on market timing is as follows the frequent trading of large dollar amounts in our group of funds is disruptive to the asset base and ultimately can damage the performance of the portfolio we do not tolerate market timers in our funds and we want all  accounts that are market timing our funds to be banned from market timing our funds  rss sales department frequently used the fourexchange limitation language from the prospectuses as the basis for prohibiting market timing indeed in response to a questionnaire about rss policies and practices rs stated rs investments does not allow market timing in any funds you may not exchange your investment more than four times in any month period unlimited trading and longterm asset arrangements  notwithstanding the exchange provisions in the prospectuses and the internal practices described above rs entered into at least four arrangements with three customers allowing the customers to engage in an unlimited number of trades these arrangements included the simultaneous investment of longterm assets in the rs mutual fund these longterm assets generated additional management fees for rs  for example as of october  an rs sales representative entered into a written agreement with a brokerage firm allowing an investor to make unlimited trades of up to  million per transaction provided that advance notice was given to rs simultaneously the investor made a longterm asset commitment of  million to be invested in one of the rs funds this asset generated approximately  in management fees for rs  in addition by late  rs had at least two other longterm asset arrangements with investors in place these arrangements allowed the investors to engage in unlimited trading in amounts ranging from  million to  million per trade at the same time these investors invested longterm assets ranging from approximately  million to  million  in about the fall of  rs decided to disallow market timing in the egf due to a decline in egfs asset base rs began to notify its large shortterm traders who made up the majority of the shortterm trading assets that they would no longer be welcome to markettime the egf in response several of these frequent traders proposed to rs that they be allowed to continue their shortterm trading in the egf and would place a longterm asset into the egf hecht and cohen reviewed these proposals and selected the proposal that was the most financially advantageous for the firm under the proposal accepted by rs in october  the investor was permitted to make an unlimited number of trades of up to  million per transaction in return for a  million longterm investment to be placed in the egf all other large timers were prohibited from market timing in the egf  as a result of this arrangement between october  and july  the investor was permitted to make approximately  exchanges which resulted in millions of dollars of net profits when the investor later expressed its intention to withdraw some portion of the long term asset from the egf and decided to invest a portion in an rs hedge fund rs requested that the traders market timing activity be limited so that the  ratio of long term assets to timing assets would be maintained however by the time the investment was made in the rs hedge fund in july  the investor had ceased its market timing activity  between  and mid the large investors who were granted trading privileges netted millions of dollars in profits from their trading activities notwithstanding the fourexchange limitation language in the prospectuses some of these investors made hundreds of exchanges annually potentially driving up the specific funds management costs at the expense of other shareholders during this time period rs reaped at least  million in additional fees generated by the excessive trading assets and longterm assets resulting from rss arrangements with certain investors  neither rs nor its officers conducted any written study or analysis to determine whether such trading was harmful to the specific rs funds and their shareholders failure to disclose the longterm asset arrangements and the potential conflicts associated with them  at no time did the respondents notify the funds shareholders and board of trustees that it was permitting certain investors to market time by exceeding the fourexchange language in the rs funds while excluding others from exceeding it the respondents also failed to disclose the potential conflict of interest created by rss acceptance of longterm assets from market timers and management fees generated on those assets contrary to the interests of other investors rss remedial actions  on its own volition rs has taken the following voluntary remedial actions a has taken steps to prevent markettiming in any of its funds b has undertaken to use its best efforts to ensure the funds compliance with the funds stated fourexchange per  month period limitation including adopting a zerotolerance policy for identified markettiming activity c has begun daily review of investor activity to identify market timing or other suspicious trading activity d has begun to hold a quarterly risk assessment meeting between the independent trustees senior compliance including the chief compliance officer cco trading desk personnel and outside counsel including counsel to the independent trustees and counsel to the funds prior to each board meeting the risk management committee as part of this effort rs has increased its legal and compliance personnel to six from two e has closed the rs money market fund and ceased active

certain investors to exceed the exchange limitation in the prospectus and did not disclose the existence of arrangements that allowed certain investors to conduct unlimited trading while

prescribed for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by registered companies such as the rs funds on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participants without obtaining a commission order approving the transaction specifically rs as investment adviser is an affiliated person of the rs funds rs caused certain rs funds to enter into joint arrangements whereby rs accepted a longterm asset from a shareholder in an rs fund pursuant to an arrangement allowing the same shareholder to exceed exchange limits set by the prospectus in the same or other rs fund for example rs accepted a longterm asset in the egf from a shareholder while allowing that shareholder to effect excessive exchanges in the egf rs earned increased management fees on those longterm assets held by the rs funds while allowing the approved exchange activity by contrast the affected rs funds obtained little or no benefit from this unauthorized activity the commission never granted an order approving the transactions  as a result of the conduct described in paragraphs  through  above rs willfully violated and cohen and hecht caused and willfully aided and abetted violations of section b of the investment company act which provides in pertinent part that it is unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement
