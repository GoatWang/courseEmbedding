rights reserved home  events  newsletter  talent  videos  merch  contact the dynasty was founded in  on the blood sweat and tears of two men who loved professional wrestling but hated what the current independent scene was offering in  two friends tom “ugly” burnell  chris envy were professional wrestlers traveling the roads together working where ever they could to get their names out there they worked some well run promotions as well as some really really bad ones both as life long wrestling fans felt the fans deserved more than the current product together they decided they wanted to see if they could do better they decided to rent a ring from a promoter they had both worked for in nj and found a venue willing to donate the property in exchange for a donation envy contacted wrestlers he was familiar with locally and tom took care of the local promotional side of things as well as sponsorships on august   they founded the xyreme wrestling alliance xwa “an alliance of the most extreme wrestlers int he area” envy deemed the promotion in the opening monologue promo  highlights the event was a rousing success as over local fans filled the parking lot of the dm hamilton steamer company in coxsackie ny all total over  was donated on behalf of the xwa and the two were off and running registerstar post or so they thought they began planning a followup event in october of  until envy received a notfication from the new york state athletic commission stating that running a prowrestling event in ny without a promoter’s license was a misdemeanor alas the xwa once promising future met an early demise to the dismay of many of the local wrestlers who desperately sought a home to wrestle away from another local promotion that is until may  envy and ugly had once again got bitten by the promotional bug and decided to try their hand at running shows again this time in a more legitimate way they partnered with another promoter and copromoted the event under their license and again rented a ring to showcase better talent better production value better awareness of the business side of things on august   tom and chris debuted the dynasty before  fans in cobleskill ny with an event dubbed “diamonds are forever” the event featured former wwe champoion and future tna champoion bobby lashley ad wwe hall of famer “mr usa” tony atlas also on the card were ring of honor tv
