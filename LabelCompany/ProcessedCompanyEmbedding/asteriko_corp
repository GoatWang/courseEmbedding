some elements of what asteriko corp will offer to its customers however no direct competition exists since the product that our company develops is unique to design and construction industry it uses innovative technological solution that is low cost and economical several differences in application arise when comparing our technology to color changing paint technology as well as some colored light arrangements the main difference in application is simplicity as one can imagine the installation of a ceiling panel or wall panel compared to painting or running electricity no major surface preparation is required another significant difference is flexibility of installation in terms of design and final appearance taking rectangular grid ceiling panel as example not only various ornamental combinations could be applied right at the customer site but also customer is left with the ability to adjust and even entirely change the appearance of the ceiling by rotating and relocating individual panels there is also a difference in application of our innovative technology once we fully launch operations we expect to compete successfully on a basis of price quality and novelty of our product currently our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations company description we are a

forward looking statements   this annual report contains forwardlooking statements these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance these statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as may will expect believe anticipate estimate approximate or continue or the negative thereof we intend that such forwardlooking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made any forwardlooking statements represent managements best judgment as to what may occur in the future however forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected we disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events   general   asteriko corp was incorporated in the state of nevada on april   our offices are located at  corporate way suite  valley cottage ny    we are a company with limited earnings to date and nominal operations and assets with a focus on earlystage business activities such as proof of concept development small batch manufacturing and promoting our new technology since incorporation management has developed a detailed business plan to provide customers with unique and innovative solution for their decorative needs our initial product is lattice panels designed for suspended ceiling these panels will dynamically change the color of their surface with the change of the viewing angle and  or the type of illumination   productsservices   description of product or services   our initial product will be color changing lattice panels designed for suspended ceiling   the idea of color changing surfaces is not new color decomposition of reflected light also known as refraction combined with light interference is a known effect and is used in automotive industry for development of special paints   our approach is to achieve similar results using different and more cost effective technology this approach is based on ability of an average human eye to blend reflected lights and view them as a single color the type of color depends on combination of base colors red blue and green in the reflection all color tvs use similar principle to achieve multicolor effect the main difference with our proposal is that tv generates light whereas we use the surface reflection only select material can be used to achieve this effect the surface of the material should have special geometrical figures on a small level and each painted with at least  different colors     prior to creating asteriko corp our president has done many experiments and discovered that simple d transparent rectangular grid structure could act as a color changing decorative element by simply applying different colors to different faces of the d grid viewed from different angles such structure appears to have not only different but also dynamically changing color depending of the viewpoint of the observer   the grid density and the height of each individual rectangular cell defines the light transparency of the element if back lit as well as the sensitivity of the color shifting to a different viewing angle desired color changing effects can also be achieved through the application of directional spray painting to randomly oriented microsurfaces   we are beginning to experiment with rigid and soft foam it is our understanding that foam sheets of ” to ” thick rigid or soft could be made as d lattices of adjacent polygons much like certain types of packing foam having painted each face of the polygon into different color will create desired color changing illusion if viewed from different directions                our plan is to carry out a phased approach in establishing and developing asteriko corp the first phase will focus on developing and refining design solutions and producing samples  the second phase will be production and manufacturing   phase one     a select the most effective way to make a given surface to change its color   b identify the materials to be used   c manufacture and sell small batches of different materials such as ceiling panels as a proof of concept to see if our products generate interest   d enhance directional spray painting process to achieve better quality   e document the technological process and our “know how”   phase two     a advertise our product and technology   b negotiate with suppliers and manufacturers of the foam panels of desired geometry currently suppliers such as clark foam products corp and several others all capable of manufacturing an initial monochromatic d foam lattices   c establish distribution network   d expand our technology to other materials used for surface decorations capitalizing the basic working principle of the d rectangular color changing grid   in case of successful growth of our business necessary funds will be available through operating profits to further optimize present technique for making color changing rectangular lattices and foam panels as well as establishing proper manufacturing it will also be possible to start producing samples of color changing ceramic or stamped metal tiles   target market and clientspotential clients   the main target market for our products and services will include retail and commercial establishments where unique and original appearance is an integral part of their success we will also provide design solutions and materials to the residential sector   our potential customers will be in the following potential sectors   first phase     • building contractors and industrial design and architecture companies   • home owners for new builds or renovations   future phases     • retail establishments eg boutique and specialty stores   • commercial establishments including restaurants night clubs theaters hotels and fitness clubs   • geographically at the initial stage of our development we’ll target the north american markets   source of revenue   our main of source of revenue will initially be the sales of design solutions to the house and building designers and constructors ie      design of colorshifting suspended ceiling panels to customerprovided specifications    consulting on application and integration of our panels into customer interior or exterior design   additional revenue stream is expected to come from manufacturing of colorshifting suspended ceiling surfaces for home owners as well as retail and commercial establishments in the future                  marketing strategy   in order to attract customers and promote products our company has created the website we will also market through online advertisements for online and website advertising we will use the following methods     • link our site to free web directories   • use shared online advertisement facilities   • distribute online banners to attract more attention from the customers and provide credibility to the product by including customer feedback   • advertise through classified ads and blogs   • add our website address to the relevant search engines   we will also advertise through local and global classified ads and social networking  sales brochures will be printed to provide necessary company product and service information we will organize onsite presentations for perspective clients with sample demonstrations   competition and competitive strategy   there is a small number of potential competitors that provide some elements of what asteriko corp will offer to its customers  however no direct competition exists since the product that our company develops is unique to design and construction industry  it uses innovative technological solution that is low cost and economical     several differences in application arise when comparing our technology to color changing paint technology as well as some colored light arrangements the main difference in application is simplicity as one can imagine the installation of a ceiling panel or wall panel compared to painting or running electricity no major surface preparation is required another significant difference is flexibility of installation in terms of design and final appearance taking rectangular grid ceiling panel as example not only various ornamental combinations could be applied right at the customer site but also customer is left with the ability to adjust and even entirely change the appearance of the ceiling by rotating and relocating individual panels   there is also a difference in application of our innovative technology  once we fully launch operations we expect to compete successfully on a basis of price quality and novelty of our product     currently our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations   sources and availability of products and supplies   we believe that our presidents industry experience and connections will enable us to develop the various aspects of the business mr tomski has experience with design and engineering of products and creating promotion and marketing packages while working as research scientist and industrial post doctoral fellow for ionics mass spectrometry group inc mr tomski in addition to his main duties as research scientist has been actively involved in promoting the company products through installations demonstrations and training provided to existing and potential customers around the world he also promoted companys products through onsite and offsite presentations and industrial conferences throughout his career mr tomski has been involved in design and manufacturing of hitech industrial equipment such as high vacuum systems for utilization in particle accelerator applications in general and for accelerator mass spectrometry application in particular mr tomski has hands on experience in design manufacturing and operation of ion optical elements such as atmospheric pressure to vacuum sampling interface ion guides ion collision cells that are vital components of commercial mass spectrometers for biomedical applications mr tomski has also been involved in design and manufacturing of cryogenic systems for commercial superconducting gravity gradiometer this includes design and manufacturing of superconducting electrical circuits and gradiometer sensor components     currently he oversees design and manufacturing of superconducting gravity gradiometer sensor in the startup company targeting major land exploration and natural resources surveying   we believe there are no constraints on the sources or availability of products materials and supplies related to the production of suspended panels   dependence on one or a few major customers   at this stage we sell small number of panels as a proof of concept to test the market reaction to our product   we currently have only  customers generated  in revenue to date we plan to extend our market in the near future     our products are applicable to a wide range of customers from individual home owners to commercial construction companies   we believe because of the potentially broad base of customers for our services we will not rely on one or few major customers                our initial contract with “glikart” was created to attract new customer with  discount for a period of  months due to different needs of the clients we cannot in advance include in the contract specific materials or design for each specific order we disclose the type of materials to be used design specifications and labor rates currently we don’t have special relationships with these customers other than contract with “glikart” offering  discount for  months  any customer may purchase our product based on their needs   patent trademark license  franchise

    our independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills from inception to june   we have generated revenues of  no significant additional revenue is anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage   to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering we believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand our proposed operations however there is no guarantee that we will stay in business after doing so at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements

equity and debt instruments in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i acquisition of software ii developmental expenses associated with a startup business and iii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds

company provides customers with unique and innovative solutions for their decorative needs the company’s initial product is lattice panels designed for suspended ceilings   note   significant and critical accounting policies and practices   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application  critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   basis of presentation   the company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the companys critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements was were     i assumption as a going concern  management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business         ii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  management assumes that the realization of the companys net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry – forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions and c its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates         f          fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels  the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs  the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below   level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs  if the inputs used to

of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur  the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment  in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the companys financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed           f        loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed management does not believe based upon information available

company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   income tax provision   the company accounts for income taxes under section  of the fasb accounting standards codification  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date   the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures   the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets as well as tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary   management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years if actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary   uncertain tax positions   the company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of section  for the year ended june   and june     net income loss per common share   net income loss per common share is computed pursuant to section  of the fasb accounting standards codification basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period

accumulated deficit at june   of  a net loss of  and negative cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended june   these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern   although the company has recognized some nominal amount of revenues since inception the company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced the company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue however the companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations  while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering   the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note  – stockholders equity   shares authorized   upon
