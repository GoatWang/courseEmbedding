freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples

openconcept space when rapidly expanding independent oil and gas company denbury resources started construction on a new office building in plano texas they wanted their new office space to be a physical representation of their collaborative and teamfirst company culture denbury desired a space that literally exemplified their company’s opendoor policy – they wanted an interior space with no doors to private offices additionally there were no cubicles and abundant amounts of openspace only conference rooms would have doors with such a bold vision comes privacy and noise concerns a completely open office space with no cubicle partitions or office doors to block sound would mean that speech privacy would be compromised and noise distractions would be elevated how could they retain their open concept vision but also create an acoustically comfortable environment to help solve the problem denbury consulted with a telecommunications integrator about introducing sound masking – the process of adding a low level unobtrusive background sound to an environment to reduce the intelligibility of human speech and reduce noise distractions by making nearby conversations unintelligible sound masking protects speech privacy and allows individuals to work more productively solution qtpro™ sound masking system denbury resources installed cambridge sound management’s cost effective qtpro sound masking system to accommodate the acoustical requirements of their  square foot three floor seven building office complex small barely visible emitters speakers

in the bathrooms to provide music and paging resources in these areas a more pleasant work environment not only has denbury resources been able to create greater privacy in their private offices and corridors they have a more pleasant work environment with fewer distractions in open office areas as well “utilizing sound masking from cambridge sound management keeps the cross talk between the offices and corridors down so you don’t hear interoffice conversations i highly recommend sound masking as a solution for open concept office spaces” – steve shanks manager of audio video surveillance and security “when the sound masking is turned off there is a huge different in the building it’s one of those things that you don’t know it’s there until it’s gone” – michael roberts audio visual
