nakedness forms my principle view and i wonderhow that glorious virgin back of hers will look tomorrow or the day after tomorrowmine has borne stripes for so long they do not matter i look constantly at melodyscrossed hands and bound wrists shes so sweet she does not struggle innocentlyher ﬁngers accept their condition as captive to the cords looking at melodys back and melodys tied hands i see also my own for we are similarly bound sometimesone of us will stumble or take a false step and thus snub our three foot length of tethering chain to jerk at both necks but this we do not mind we love each otherour two guards who marched us back to servitude laughing delighted in telling usof punishments to come we were runaways and could expect the worst but nowthey feel sorry for us and strive to console and reassure offering the possibility of lenores forgiveness of our sin we do not believe a word of itthey are intrigued by the lovely silver ring around my throat above the chain theyinsist again and again on my recounting the agonies it imposes when i run a steptoo far from my enslavement to the estate they ﬁnger it in curiosity with loving hands assuring me i will have to wear it all my life it will never allow me to go asingle step beyond what lenore will choose they had heard of the ring but hadnever previously seen one they cheerfully admit to an erotic longing to be thusringed themselves since they have neither intent nor wish to escape a ring like thisis an almost living bond between the girl who wears it and her mistress melodyassures them they dont know when they are well offour ponygirl escort do not wear the harness of a guard as do i melody hadcounselled against taking it with us when we ran away but i was strangely loath topart with it the tight clutch of its straps gently and insistently imposed an eroticthrill while at the same time endowing me with authority over any other girl savethose who wore the harness too ruefully i wondered if my status as a guard wouldsurvive this latest of my runaway exploits almost certainly they would take theharness away from me when i was whipped i had no doubt whatever that i wouldbe whipped it was the least i could expect and would probably be only one of many punishments i must bear my heart bled for melody the poor darling was soinnocent of guilti had many times been made more helpless than now tied wrists and a chain   around my neck was nothing new but the circumstances under which i was thusbound imposed a fearful impotence to have had freedom within my grasp but bedefeated by an electric impulse from a silver ring around my neck was bitter galllenore had been playing with me all the time knowing i would run but curious tosee how and when then she set her infernal gadget to reduce me to a helpless massof torment at a range of miles she had let me make my own trap and walk into it idont suppose she had ﬁgured on melody running with me to guide me to the secretroad i felt bad about melody and the punishment waiting for her because she wasmy friendi wondered if lenore would allow me to retain possession of melody and nonacelie and inga  or whether they would be taken from me along with my leatherharness i could plead melodys innocence by afﬁrming my ownership telling of aﬁctional compulsion i had placed upon the poor girl to lead me to freedom lenoreprobably would not buy it but i could tryi twisted at bound hands in bitter frustration i thought of bill trafford my masterit had been he rather than freedom i sought in ﬂight now i would never see himagain he could not come to me on the estate and the ring around my throat madecertain i would not go to him melody and these two girl who were leading us asprisoners found it so easy to be happy with the estate but they had been born thereand i had not once again i cursed my tendency to rebellion it would cost me dearlenores farmstead greeted us with unconcern ponies who had seen melody and iled across the yard bound and connected by our shameful chain only smiled andnodded as though knowing this the inevitable end of too much freedom weevidently no longer rated the house but were taken directly to the stables where thegirl in charge told me my other ponies were harnessed to the mistress buggy andwere either hard at work or hitched to a post we were taken to a concrete slab andthere hosed down and laughingly toweled dry she then said she had a single vacantstall at the far end of the row as far from my beloved team as we could get wewere then lovingly kissed by our two girl escort who assured us they had thoroughlyenjoyed bringing us back to be ponies the way we were supposed to be they kissedus several times assuring us we shouldnt worry about punishment that might nothappen we could see the stable girl did not believe them any more than we didthey went away to other duties and we were invited to walk in behind the bars andto hear the fateful clang and locking of the iron bar door melody and i were still joined by the locked chain upon our necks and our hands still tied behind ourbacks i felt positive we were in deep disgrace when we asked the stable girl shesaid she knew nothing about it but had been told to keep us safe melody and iexchanged knowing glances and sat down on the straw jerking our necks as we didso and not even chucklingyou may be right darling melody

join pope francis on this walk along the way from the foreword by archbishop joseph e kurtz ask someone for a definition of christianity and you are likely to hear a philosophical historical or even cultural description ofit but any explanation of the christian faith that fails to define it as a way of being of proceeding is missing the mark for at its core christianity is about livingand lovingas committed disciples of jesus christembracing the way of jesus is a beautifully curated collection of excerpts from the homilies and writings of pope francis all centering on christianity as a way of lifeor as the earliest christians would have understood it the way through the popes meditations on scripture we pause to consider essential aspects of discipleship such as the way of the cross the way of prayer the way of children the way of the poor and more the book even offers a rare opportunity to see more clearly the path of discipleship through the lens of the old testament for

dissertations   all theses and dissertations title origamibased design for engineering applications author kevin campbell francis brigham young university  provofollow abstract origami can be a powerful source of design inspiration in the creation of reconfigurable systems with unparalleled performance this thesis provides fundamental tools for designers to employ as origamibased designs are pursued in their respective fields of expertise the first chapter introduces origami and makes connections between origami and engineering design through a survey of engineered applications and characterizing the relationship between origami and compliant mechanisms the second chapter evaluates the creasing of nonpaper sheet materials such as plastics and metals to facilitate origamibased compliant mechanism design although it is anticipated that most origamibased design will result from surrogate folds indirect methods of replacing the crease it is valuable to provide information that may help in more direct approaches for origamibased design in materials other than paper planar sheets of homogeneous material are considered as they maintain the principles fundamental to origami flat initial state low cost readily available the reduced stiffness along the axis of the crease is an enabling characteristic of origami hence a metric based on the deformation of the crease compared to the deformation of the panels enables engineering materials to be evaluated based on their ability to achieve the hingelike behavior observed in folded paper advantages of both high and low values of this metric are given testing results hinge indexes residual angles localized hinge behavior and cyclic creasing to failure are presented for various metals and polymers this methodology and subsequent findings are provided to enable origamibased design of compliant mechanisms the third chapter proposes a basic terminology for origamibased design and presents areas of considerations for cases where the final engineering design is directly related to a crease pattern this framework for navigating from paper art to engineered products begins once the crease pattern has been selected for a given application the four areas of consideration are discussed  rigid foldability  crease characterization  material properties and dimensions and  manufacturing two examples are concurrently presented to illustrate these considerations a backpack shell and a shroud for an adjustable carm xray device used in hospitals the final chapter provides concluding remarks on origamibased design
