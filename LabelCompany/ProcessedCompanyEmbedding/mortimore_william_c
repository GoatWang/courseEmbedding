the court of appeals see wis stat §  and rule  cir ct no cv ap state of wisconsin in court of appeals district i william c mortimore plaintiffrespondent david m noshay plaintiff v merge technologies inc nka merge healthcare inc defendantappellant appeal from an order of the circuit court for milwaukee county william w brash judge reversed and cause remanded before curley pj fine and kessler jj no ap ¶ kessler j merge technologies inc  merge  appeals a nonfinal order of the circuit court denying its motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration we conclude that the dispute between merge and william c mortimore concerning whether an alleged oral contract eliminated the requirement to arbitrate mortimore s breach of contract claims is itself an arbitrable issue accordingly we reverse the circuit court and remand the matter for arbitration background ¶ this case arises out of a contractual dispute between mortimore and merge mortimore was a founder of merge and served as its chairman from its inception in  until june  mortimore also served as merge s ceo from  until  when the board of directors hired richard linden to replace mortimore ¶ mortimore and merge entered into their first written employment contract in september  the contract contained an arbitration provision requiring the parties to arbitrate any and all claims arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach hereof the  contract also prohibited oral modifications in  upon mortimore s replacement as ceo mortimore and merge entered into a new written employment contract containing the same arbitration provision from the  contract in  mortimore and merge entered into another employment contract superseding the  contract the parties eventually entered into a new employment contract on march   that superseded the terms of the employment agreement dated december    this court in a separate order granted the petition for leave to appeal the nonfinal order on november   see wis stat rule   all references to the wisconsin statutes are to the  version unless otherwise stated  no ap as amended like the previous contracts the  contract contained an arbitration provision and prohibited oral modifications of the contract specifically the  contract stated  arbitration a subject to the terms ¦ below upon the presentation of a written claim or claims collectively claims  arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach hereof by an aggrieved party the other party shall have thirty  days in which to make such inquiries of the aggrieved party and conduct such investigations as it believes reasonably necessary to determine the validity of the claims at the end of such period of investigation the complained of party shall either pay the amount of the claims or the arbitration proceeding described in section b shall be invoked subject to the terms ¦ below b in the event that the claims are not settled by the procedure set forth in section a the claims shall be submitted to arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules  rules  of the american arbitration association  aaa  except as amplified or otherwise varied hereby c the parties shall submit the dispute to the milwaukee wisconsin regional office of the aaa and the situs of the arbitration shall be milwaukee wisconsin ¦  general provisions c amendment and waiver no amendment or modification of this agreement shall be valid or binding upon the company unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the company duly authorized by the board or upon the executive unless made in writing and signed by him the waiver by the company of the breach of any provision of this agreement by the executive shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by him emphasis added  no ap ¶ in august  following merge s successful acquisition of a canadian software company which resulted in a substantial increase in merge s revenue merge s board of directors delegated authority to a compensation committee to create new employment contracts for six merge executives including mortimore and linden the committee worked on these new contracts from august  until early  according to minutes from the compensation committee meetings the merge executives desired consistent contracts however due to protracted negotiations with one particular executive new contracts were not finalized on february   the compensation committee expressly deferred making any decision on the contracts until after negotiating with that executive ¶ in the meantime beginning in january  merge began receiving anonymous whistleblower letters indicating that merge was improperly reporting its financial position in order to make the company look more successful merge s audit committee commenced an investigation and on february   linden decided that no executives other than david noshay and the newlyhired bob white would receive new contracts as a result on march   the compensation committee placed on hold any new executive contracts except for those of noshay and white ¶ as a result of the investigation linden eventually was forced to resign and mortimore a member of the board of directors was named interimceo securities and exchange commission  sec  regulations required merge to disclose mortimore s employment contract as interimceo merge filed an sec form k on may   stating that the  contract was the controlling contract of mortimore s employment  no ap ¶ following the filing of sec form k the compensation committee amended mortimore s contract to reflect changes in his compensation stemming from his interimceo position the compensation committee and mortimore then worked towards drafting a new written contract for mortimore as of june   two substantively different contract drafts were being edited by two different people one draft was a new contract the other amended mortimore s  contract that same day anna hajek the head of the compensation committee prepared a draft cover letter for a new contract for mortimore the new contract did not contain an arbitration clause the letter and contract however were never sent or signed ¶ the following day an attorney conducting the audit committee s investigation forwarded emails to merge s outside counsel indicating that mortimore interfered with merge s audit confirmation process hajek was subsequently instructed not to offer mortimore a new contract until the investigation was complete merge s board of directors eventually sought mortimore s resignation mortimore resigned on june   ¶ mortimore retained separate counsel to represent him in the various law suits and investigations that stemmed from the anonymous whistleblower letters pursuant to merge s bylaws and wis stat §  merge s board of directors advanced mortimore s legal fees the board ceased paying mortimore s legal expenses however in february  this eventually led mortimore to file a fourcount complaint alleging among other things breach of contract for refusing to pay any of the amounts due under the contract ¶ merge moved to dismiss certain claims and stay the remaining claims pending arbitration of mortimore s breach of contract allegation pursuant  no ap to the arbitration clause contained in the  contract mortimore filed an amended complaint effectually alleging that the terms of the  contract had been superseded by oral terms and conditions essentially creating a new contract that did not contain an arbitration provision merge renewed its motion to dismiss and stay pending arbitration the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the  contract had been superseded by an oral contract in  that eliminated the arbitration requirement the circuit court found based on merge s actions and conduct that  mortimore and merge entered into a new oral employment contract on or about june    the  oral contract eliminated the mandatory arbitration provision of the  contract and  despite the new contract not being signed merge demonstrated an intent to contract with mortimore rendering the  oral contract effective ¶ merge filed for leave to appeal the circuit court s nonfinal order denying merge s motion to stay pending arbitration we granted merge s petition this appeal follows discussion ¶ on appeal merge argues that the question of whether the alleged  oral contract superseded the  written contract thereby eliminating the arbitration requirement of mortimore s breach of contract claims is itself an arbitrable issue specifically merge contends that the circuit court erroneously failed to refer the dispute to arbitration because  issues arising out of the  contract are to be resolved by an arbitrator and  mortimore agreed to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability because the  contract incorporated the american arbitration association s  aaa  commercial arbitration rules suggesting that questions of arbitrability are for an arbitrator rather than the court we agree  no ap applicable law ¶ at the outset we note that mortimore does not challenge the validity of the  contract rather he argues that a  oral agreement superseded the  contract thereby eliminating the  contract s mandatory arbitration clause as such mortimore contends that his breach of contract claims are not subject to arbitration therefore at issue in this appeal is solely whether mortimore s claims regarding the alleged  oral contract fall under the mandatory arbitration provision of the  contract which applies to all claims arising out of the  contract and adopts the aaa commercial arbitration rules merge s motion to stay pending arbitration involves issues of contract interpretation and a determination of substantive arbitrability questions of law we review de novo see joint school dist no  city of jefferson v jefferson ed ass n  wis d    nwd   ¶ arbitration in wisconsin is governed by wis stat ch  the wisconsin arbitration act the act reflects the sensible policy of this state ¦ to promote arbitration as a viable and valuable form of alternative dispute resolution manutronics inc v effective mgmt sys inc  wis d    nwd  ct app  this principle is specifically reflected in wis stat §  which provides parties with the opportunity to stay litigation pending arbitration if any suit or proceeding be brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration the court in which such suit is pending upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration  no ap ¶ as guidance in determining the court s function in arbitration disputes wisconsin has adopted the general teachings set forth in the steelworkers trilogy cirilli v country ins  fin servs  wi app  ¶  wis d   nwd  the steelworks trilogy provides first that arbitration is a matter of contract and as such no party can be compelled to arbitrate a matter which he or she has not agreed to submit to arbitration cirilli  wis d  ¶ second the question of arbitrability is one for judicial determination unless the parties expressly agree otherwise att tech inc v communication workers of america  us    third in determining whether the parties have agreed to submit a matter for arbitration we do not consider the merits of the underlying claim id it necessarily follows that even if it appears to the court to be frivolous the claim at issue is to be decided not by the court asked to order arbitration but as the parties have agreed by the arbitrator cirilli  wis d  ¶ finally contracts that contain arbitration clauses carry a strong presumption of arbitration therefore doubts are resolved in favor of arbitration coverage att tech  us at  ¶ in essence in determining whether a dispute is arbitrable our function is limited to a determination of whether  there is a construction of the arbitration clause that would cover the grievance on its face and  whether any other provision of the contract specifically excludes it cirilli  wis d  ¶  the steelworkers trilogy consists of united steelworkers v american mfg co  us   united steelworkers v warrior  gulf navigation co  us   and united steelworkers v enterprise wheel  car corp  us   see cirilli v country ins  fin servs  wi app  ¶ n  wis d   nwd   no ap ¶ with these principles in mind we turn to the question of whether the circuit court erred in ruling that merge s right to enforce the mandatory arbitration clause in the  contract was superseded by an alleged  oral agreement which did not contain an arbitration clause ¶ the heart of mortimore s argument is in essence that the parties agreed to execute a new written contract without an arbitration clause because mortimore contends that this alleged oral agreement is enforceable he argues his breach of contract claims are not subject to arbitration mortimore is mistaken ¶ first the  contract states that no amendment or modification of this agreement shall be valid or binding upon the company unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the company duly authorized by the board or upon the executive unless made in writing and signed by him although the circuit court found that merge s conduct effectively created an oral contract the record shows that no such modifications or changes eliminating an arbitration requirement were ever made in writing as required by plain language of the  contract mortimore s arguments essentially reveal a process of negotiation by which merge agreed to new contractual terms as a result of mortimore s position as interimceo the  contract contemplated that amendments or modifications such as those negotiated between mortimore and merge would be enforceable and binding only if made in writing thus any dispute pertaining to the amendment or modification of the  contract necessarily arises out of the  contract thereby maintaining the arbitration clause by not challenging the validity of the  contract mortimore implicitly agrees that if the  contract controls arbitration is required any determination that an alleged oral agreement superseded the  contract and eliminated the requirement to arbitrate mortimore s breach of contract claims is a determination on the merits of  no ap mortimore s claim as stated we do not make determinations on the merits see att tech  us at  ¶ second the  contract specifically adopts the aaa commercial arbitration rules which provide that decisions as to the arbitrability of a claim are to be determined by arbitrators specifically rule a provides that the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction including any objection with respect to the existence scope or validity of the arbitration agreement the act of incorporating the aaa rules suggests that the parties intended to leave the question of arbitrability of mortimore s claims to an arbitrator many other jurisdictions that have considered this issue agree that an arbitration provision s incorporation of the aaa rules or other rules giving arbitrators the authority to determine their own jurisdiction is a clear and unmistakable expression of the parties intent to reserve the question of arbitrability for the arbitrator and not the court see fallo v hightech inst  fd   th cir  see also qualcomm inc v nokia corp  fd   fed cir  terminix int l co v palmer ranch ltd p ship  fd   th cir  contec corp v remote solution co  fd   d cir  apollo computer inc v berg  fd   st cir  given wisconsin s strong policy promoting arbitration we conclude like many other jurisdictions that the parties adoption of the aaa rules in the  contract required arbitration of the question of whether an oral agreement superseded the  contract conclusion ¶ for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the circuit court erroneously denied merge s motion to stay pending arbitration the issue of  no ap whether the alleged  agreement superseded the  contract and therefore did not require arbitration of mortimore s breach of contract claims is a question for the arbitrator accordingly we reverse and remand this matter for arbitration by the court order reversed and cause remanded recommended for publication in the official reports  search this case google
