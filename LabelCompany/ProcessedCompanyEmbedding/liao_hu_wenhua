the historical novel romance of the three kingdoms has a few stories about liao hua which are not found in historical records in chapter  liao hua a bandit chief and former yellow turban rebel encountered guan yu while the latter was on a quest to reunite with liu bei he was accepted by guan yu as a subordinate after rescuing liu beis two kidnapped wives lady gan and lady mi from a fellow bandit named du yuan in chapter  liao hua took control of the vanguard during guan yus march on xiangyang he successfully lured the enemy generals cao ren and zhai yuan out of their castle allowing guan yu to seize it in the subsequent battle of fancheng liao hua was stationed at sizhong where he was in mutual support of guan pings encampment at yancheng when the enemy general xu huang captured both sizhong and yancheng liao hua and guan ping fought their way south to join guan yu when guan yu received news that liu beis territories in jing province had been conquered by sun quans army he retreated to maicheng  and was besieged there by suns forces in maicheng liao hua volunteered to break out of the siege and seek reinforcements from liu feng and meng da in shangyong  however liu feng and meng da refused to help guan yu so liao hua had no choice but to travel to chengdu to report the situation to liu bei by then guan yu had been captured in an ambush and executed by sun quan in his later life and career liao hua actively participated in the shu campaigns zhuge liangs northern expeditions and jiang weis northern expeditions against wei one of his most celebrated moments came in chapter  when sima yi was retreating from shangfang valley liao hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and being a proficient horseman was able to catch up and get close enough to strike him down however when sima yi swerved around a tree liao hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood allowing sima yi to escape during the chase however sima yi dropped his golden helmet liao hua took the helmet and traveled back to zhuge liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt this event angered wei yan who felt liao hua was being unfairly praised zhuge liang noticed this but said nothing leading to a mild distaste for wei yans jealousy the helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the wei army following zhuge liangs death liao hua moved up the ranks under jiang wei eventually receiving the secondincommand military rank of general of chariots and cavalry as jiang weis senior general liao hua was often tasked with the most important of duties such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals despite his steadfast loyalty to shu liao hua disagreed with jiang weis constant invasions of wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale he let it be known that he would run the military differently if he were in command and this led to quarrels between jiang wei and himself when liu shan eventually submitted to wei in chapter  liao hua succumbed to grief and died sao mi zhouedit the sao mi zhou  literally the broom sweeping away superstitions a novel written by a certain zhuangzhe  literally strong man during the qing dynasty contained a saying about liao hua if there are no great generals left in shu liao hua will be the vanguard ，作先鋒 it can be interpreted as shu was so lacking in talents and new blood in its twilight years that an elderly liao hua had to lead the vanguard of the shu army in battle the proverb is also used to describe a situation in which a person who is seemingly unfit for a job is forced into doing it but is willing to face what seems to be insurmountable odds against himher see alsoedit

named liao chun was a military general of the state of shu han during the three kingdoms periodcontents early career as guan yus subordinate career in shu han life after the fall of shu in fiction romance of the three kingdoms sao mi zhou see also referencesearly career as guan yus subordinateliao hua was from xiangyang commandery  jing province which is around presentday xiangyang hubei he was a registrar  under guan yu a general who served under the warlord liu bei and guarded lius territories in jing province in late  while guan yu was away at the battle of fancheng liu beis ally sun quan broke the sun–liu alliance by launching an invasion on jing province and conquering most of lius territories in the province guan yu was captured and executed by sun quans forces liao hua became a prisonerofwar of sun quan but he constantly thought of returning to liu beis side so he faked his own death and succeeded in deceiving his captors and escaping he brought his elderly mother with him and headed west towards yi province covering presentday sichuan and chongqing where liu beis domain was basedcareer in shu hanin  liu bei declared himself emperor and established the state of shu han later that year he launched a military campaign against sun quan to retake his lands in jing province and avenge guan yu liao hua and his mother encountered the shu armies at zigui county liu bei was very pleased to see liao hua and he appointed the latter as the administrator  of yidu commandery  around presentday yidu hubei after liu bei died in  liao hua became an army advisor  under zhuge liang the chancellorregent of shu he was later assigned to be in charge of guangwu commandery  around presentday yongdeng county gansu and was subsequently promoted to right general of chariots and cavalry  he was also appointed as the inspector  of bing province – even though bing province was not under shus jurisdiction – and enfeoffed as a marquis of a central district  he was known for his fiery personality and determination his position in the shu military was equivalent to those of zhang yi and zong yuliao hua was critical of the shu general jiang wei who continued zhuge liangs aggressive foreign policy against shus rival state cao wei by launching a series of eleven campaigns to attack cao wei between  and  he participated in the third and fourth campaigns in  and  respectively in  when jiang wei was about to embark on the eleventh campaign liao hua remarked one who does not refrain from using military force will end up burning himself i am referring to boyue jiang wei he is inferior to the enemy in terms of intelligence and military power yet he keeps attacking them how can he expect to overcome them the events of today are exactly as described in this line from the classic of poetry why were these things not before me or why were they not after melife after the fall of shuin late  shus rival state cao wei launched a campaign to conquer shu and succeeded in doing so within a year when the shu emperor liu shan surrendered after the fall of shu liao hua was ordered to move out of former shu territory to the wei capital luoyang he died of illness on the journeyliao huas birth year could not be determined because his age at the time of his death was not recorded in history however it could be deduced that he was in his s when he died around  when zhuge zhan took charge of affairs in the shu imperial court liao hua visited zong yu who said both of us are already above the age of  in fictionromance of the three kingdomsthe historical novel romance of the three kingdoms has a few stories about liao hua which are not found in historical recordsin chapter  liao hua a bandit chief and former yellow turban rebel encountered guan yu while the latter was on a quest to reunite with liu bei he was accepted by guan yu as a subordinate after rescuing liu beis two kidnapped wives lady gan and lady mi from a fellow bandit named du yuanin chapter  liao hua took control of the vanguard during guan yus march on xiangyang he successfully lured the enemy generals cao ren and zhai yuan out of their castle allowing guan yu to seize it in the subsequent battle of fancheng liao hua was stationed at sizhong where he was in mutual support of guan pings encampment at yancheng when the enemy general xu huang captured both sizhong and yancheng liao hua and guan ping fought their way south to join guan yu when guan yu received news that liu beis territories in jing province had been conquered by sun quans army he retreated to maicheng  and was besieged there by suns forces in maicheng liao hua volunteered to break out of the siege and seek reinforcements from liu feng and meng da in shangyong  however liu feng and meng da refused to help guan yu so liao hua had no choice but to travel to chengdu to report the situation to liu bei by then guan yu had been captured in an ambush and executed by sun quanin his later life and career liao hua actively participated in the shu campaigns zhuge liangs northern expeditions and jiang weis northern expeditions against wei one of his most celebrated moments came in chapter  when sima yi was retreating from shangfang valley liao hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and being a proficient horseman was able to catch up and get close enough to strike him down however when sima yi swerved around a tree liao hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood allowing sima yi to escape during the chase however sima yi dropped his golden helmet liao hua took the helmet and traveled back to zhuge liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt this event angered wei yan who felt liao hua was being unfairly praised zhuge liang noticed this but said nothing leading to a mild distaste for wei yans jealousy the helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the wei army following zhuge liangs death liao hua moved up the ranks under jiang wei eventually receiving the secondincommand military rank of general of chariots and cavalry as jiang weis senior general liao hua was often tasked with the most important of duties such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals despite his steadfast loyalty to shu liao hua disagreed with jiang weis constant invasions of wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale he let it be known that he would run the military differently if he were in command and this led to quarrels between jiang wei and himself when liu shan eventually submitted to wei in chapter  liao hua succumbed to grief and diedsao mi zhouthe sao mi zhou  literally the broom sweeping away superstitions a novel written by a certain zhuangzhe  literally strong man during the qing dynasty contained a saying about liao hua if there are no great generals left in shu liao hua will be the vanguard ，作先鋒 it can be interpreted as shu was so lacking in talents and new blood in its twilight years that an elderly liao hua had to lead the vanguard of the shu army in battle the proverb is also used to describe a situation in which a person who is seemingly unfit for a job is forced into doing it but is willing to face what seems to be insurmountable odds against himhersee alsolist of people
