print pimco absolute return strategy pars profile main bodystrategy overviewmany investors are searching for sources of additional return without systematic exposure to stock and bond markets and they are looking to investment managers with proven expertise substantial risk management resources and a timetested investment process motivations to search for attractive absolute  excess returns include the desire to transport returns to other more efficient markets as well as desires for superior standalone absolute return investments pimco offers the ‚Äúpars‚Äù investment approach which we believe will appeal to investors searching for consistent reliable sources of return  excess return pimco absolute return strategy pars is a unique and innovative investment approach that captures pimco‚Äôs investment process in a substantially unconstrained framework pars expands the traditional investment toolkit by using short derivatives and prudent amounts of leverage to express pimco‚Äôs investment ideas and isolate desired exposures from unwanted risks in an effort to exploit anomalies and capture value in global fixed income markets investors can select from four different pars strategy variations that best meet their risk and return preferencespars investment approach we believe that using multiple sources of value added in pars is an outstanding way to seek to produce consistent excess returns pimco implements a large number of diversified strategies and does not rely on only one type of strategy or one sector of the market to help add value pimco utilizes its expertise in a wide range of areas in an attempt to add value pimco absolute return strategies seek to produce absolute returns by expressing pimco‚Äôs investment ideas in portfolios that are not tied to traditional investment benchmarks these strategies subject to a suitable set of investment guidelines permit shorting of individual securities and the prudent use of leverage and derivatives portfolio positions are driven both by the firm‚Äôs topdown macroeconomic investment research process and by bottomup relative value thinking by portfolio managers who specialize in particular sectors of the global fixed income markets portfolio managers diversify investment portfolios across a broad array of risk factors and they employ a significant number of security specific strategies pars portfolios express the firm‚Äôs topdown investment process by magnifying the principal risk factor exposures of pimco total return and global bond portfolios positioning the pars portfolios in this way allows the strategy portfolios to express pimco‚Äôs investment ideas but without undesired benchmark risks benchmark risks in the context of a broad bond market index include continuous long exposure to interest rates credit mortgages and other issues that may or may not be attractive at any moment in time pimco‚Äôs cyclical and secular economic forums drive the topdown element of the firm‚Äôs investment process which begins with an annual secular forum in which investment professionals from all of our global offices convene for three days during this time leading industry experts are invited to give presentations on various global economic and financial topics these presentations are followed by discussions among pimco‚Äôs investment professionals regarding the outlook for the global economy and interest rates over the next three to five years at the completion of the discussions the investment professionals collectively determine a bullish neutral or bearish outlook in addition to the secular three to five year horizon pimco‚Äôs investment professionals hold quarterly economic forums to discuss near term trends and to establish a cyclical outlook these outlooks are considered by the portfolio management group in a separate quarterly meeting to translate global economic themes and specific views on market conditions and relative value into interest rate sector quality and volatility strategies sources of return magnifying the risk factor exposures as expressed in the firm‚Äôs total return and global portfolios generate approximately  to  of a pars portfolio‚Äôs potential excess returns over a floating rate base of reference such as libor our investment process can be thought of as an alpha transport exercise in which the firm‚Äôs core fixed income portfolio‚Äôs alpha with respect to the barclays capital us aggregate market index is transported to libor space the remainder of absolute return strategy portfolios‚Äô excess returns should derive from their ability to take advantage of comparatively unrestrictive guidelines and to express those risk factors using the ideal securities or instruments other sources of the remaining excess returns will sometimes include quasirelative value strategies that rely on overlaystyle related positions to mitigate certain macro risks these positions are often generated by interaction of the absolute return strategy portfolio managers and the individual specialist portfolio managers topdown sources of value because pars portfolios are designed to leverage the firm‚Äôs ability to generate alpha in core fixed income portfolios investors benefit from pimco‚Äôs over  years of experience the pars investment process is specifically tailored to incorporate these sources of incremental return broadly speaking three types of ‚Äútopdown‚Äù approaches include  over and underweighting macro factors which include yield level yield curve slope country spread and currency  tactical allocations to and away from credit treasury inflationprotected securities tips municipal bonds interest rate swap spreads and mortgages  structural positions which include sales of interest rate volatility either through the purchase of mortgage securities or from the outright sale of options underweight positions in us treasury securities and overweights to treasury bond futures long positions at the short end of the yield curve which may benefit from attractive yield roll down and volatility characteristics bottomup sources of value over and above the alpha that the pars portfolios seek to generate from magnifying the firm‚Äôs topdown ideas portfolio managers attempt to generate significant excess returns from bottomup relative value strategies bottom up strategies draw on the expertise of pimco‚Äôs specialist teams to take advantage of structural inefficiencies market mispricings crosscounty or crosssector spread movements these additional returns should arise from using flexible portfolio guidelines to use the ideal set of instruments and positions for expressing risk factors from overlaying certain risk mitigating trades and from relative value trades that are developed during interaction with the various specialty areas of the firm pimco‚Äôs absolute return experience pars capitalizes on pimco‚Äôs experience managing us bond portfolios using our total return approach and expertise in fixed income markets around the globe our commitment to excellence in the management of fixed income portfolios is exemplified in our efforts to devote resources to every fixed income sector in markets across the globe while most daytoday portfolio management activities occur in our newport beach california office specialists in our nonus offices london munich singapore tokyo and sydney provide valuable insights on developments in the macroeconomic environment within their region and provide important trade recommendations as experts in their local markets benefits of pars no single strategy dominates risk the absolute return strategy integrates the full opportunity set of pimco‚Äôs investment ideas across the globe using multiple sources of valueadded the strategy capitalizes on a diversified set of exposures and investment strategies hinged on our expertise across local markets and depth of sector knowledge this active multimarket strategy executed by prudent investment management may help reduce the overall volatility of returns in the strategy ¬† low correlation to traditional asset classes by owning a highly diversified set of assets the absolute return strategy demonstrates low correlation to traditional asset classes such as bonds and stocks the strategy can provide significant diversification benefit for the investor ¬† lack of benchmark constraints may help optimize returnrisk the absolute return strategy is detached from a traditional benchmark index allowing the strategy flexibility in identifying and implementing the most optimum investment strategies with this separation of index weights and other constraints the absolute return strategy is not subject to factor exposures that might underperform on an absolute basis and instead can take advantage of differences in regional economic cycles growth trajectories and relative valuations with sectors ¬† various returnrisk versions available several versions of the absolute return strategy are available with similar overall exposures but different only in riskreturn targets this allows the investors to best match their riskreturn preferences with the version closest to their profile all versions take advantage of the same portfolio management expertise global resources implementation and execution and risk control systems in place at pimco risk management  controls control risk to limit volatility a broad diversification of investment strategies helps limit the reliance on a single strategy to add alpha instead the exposures of the absolute return strategy are consistent with total return and global portfolios scaled only by leverage but without any imperative to track a broad market index the high average credit quality maintained and limited duration and currency exposure all help to control risk in the absolute return strategy in addition the strategy is managed to a target tracking error to help reduce volatility ¬† transparency and proactive reporting we have clearly defined checks and balances to provide reasonable assurance that all risk exposures are handled in an appropriate manner advanced proprietary analytics allow us to model securities under a multitude of scenarios and we have dedicated a substantial amount of resources to monitoring both financial and operational risk ¬† commitment to advanced risk management technology by virtue of our size pimco is able to commit significant human and financial resources to the development of advanced risk management systems we use advanced proprietary quantitative tools to both measure and monitor risks such as leverage the use of leverage in particular requires careful risk assessment and sophisticated management tools these models include our tracking error model the integrated position blotter system the global relative value report and a variety of customized risk reports also are employed to determine which strategies are adding value and which need to be modified extensive use of analytical models allows us to employ investment professionals more effectively and provides a dispassionate check on investment decisions ¬† diversified stable investor base

overlay plus strategies share facebook twitter google linked in email print ‚Äãldi overlay and ldi overlay plus strategies profile main bodywhat are the pimco ldi overlay and ldi overlay plus strategiespension funds and other institutional investors seeking a closer match to their liabilities often do not want to invest their entire portfolio in fixed income ‚Äì they look to nonbond investments to target significant excess return over their liability hurdle rate they require this excess return to meet return targets or to reduce contributions or funding deficits pimco ldi overlay and ldi overlay plus strategies provide clients with tools to hedge liability risks to the level required using only a portion of assets allowing the balance of assets to be invested in other asset classes such as equities corporate bonds or alternatives ldi overlays are derivativebased portfolios where we manage liability risks such as interest rate and inflation risk with respect to the total liabilities yet using only a portion of the assets so for example we could manage the risk of the total liabilities with perhaps only onequarter to onethird of the liability value in fixed income investments which serve as collateral to meet margin requirements on the derivative overlay ldi overlays are built using swaps and other derivatives such as futures bond forwards and repos derivatives allow clients to get exposure to longdated nominal or inflationlinked cash flows with no or limited upfront investment the overlay is a levered portfolio because against the receipt of future cash flows there is a liability or financing cost often libor this approach provides clients considerable flexibility in designing their investment strategy but needs to be managed carefully ¬† ‚Äãpimco‚Äôs ldi overlay experience ‚Äãpimco is ideally placed to manage ldi overlays we have more than  years of experience trading derivatives in that time we have developed tried and tested processes and systems for trade execution settlement counterparty risk management and more we are also an active participant in shaping the future of the derivatives industry through our membership on the international swaps and derivatives association isda board and isda determination committee and on buy side working groups of london clearing house chicago mercantile exchange and ice trust in addition pimco has extensive asset and liability modeling expertise our proprietary inhouse factor models for analyzing asset and liability exposures form the basis for working with our clients to structure and manage overlays ‚Äãsources of value added ‚Äãwe believe we can add value for our ldi clients in several key areas reducing complexity and transaction costs by structuring simple but effective overlays ‚Äì our risk factor approach enables thoughtful overlay structuring solutions that reduce complexity and transaction costs while increasing flexibility a simpler risk factor‚Äìbased overlay may be just as effective as a more complex cash flow matching strategy improving funding positions by implementing robust market entry strategies ‚Äì our proven track record in identifying macro trends makes us a firstclass partner to assist clients with their market entry decisions timing is key when implementing ldi overlays entering the overlay at a  higher interest rate level can potentially improve the client‚Äôs total funding position by up to  thorough macroeconomic research is an integral part of our investment process ‚Äì we have a proven track record identifying mediumterm cyclical six to  months and longerterm secular three to five years macro trends ‚Äì and we use this as a basis for developing ldi entry strategies for our clients identifying cheap hedges ‚Äì many ldi overlays are limited to swaps only however there are other ways to hedge liability risks such as futures government bond forwards and repos that may offer investors better value than swaps at pimco our investment philosophy is to consider the ‚Äúfull toolkit‚Äù of instruments when constructing an overlay and we constantly evaluate different instruments to implement the cheapest hedge limiting transaction costs via superior trade execution ‚Äì as one of the largest global investment managers we are trading in markets across the world on a daily basis for many different portfolios and strategies our indepth understanding of market conditions pricing and flows makes it easier for us to get competitive execution saving our clients meaningful transaction costs straightforward implementation ‚Äì thanks to years of experience managing portfolios using derivatives we have tried and tested procedures for efficiently implementing new client ldi mandates for example umbrella derivatives and repo documentation gives new clients immediate access to both a wide range of counterparties and instruments swaps and futures but also forwards repos etc and highquality derivatives documentation which provides important protection against counterparty default risk our clients are spared from lengthy and complex legal derivative document negotiations ‚Äãpimco‚Äôs approach to ldi overlays ‚Äãour approach is flexible and we work with clients to design and implement the appropriate solution we can broadly identify two approaches buyandholdpassive ‚Äì we work with clients and their advisers to determine the appropriate structure we then implement the overlay subject to trigger levels if required and handle ongoing operational requirements and counterparty risk management including collateral management although this is a buyandhold approach and the client needs to instruct us to make any changes to the overlay we do not run these mandates on an ‚Äúimplementandforget‚Äù basis we can adjust the overlay if new liability cash flows become available and also actively advise clients on an ongoing basis on ways to improve the overlay such as taking advantage of market dislocations activeldi overlay plus ‚Äì for these strategies we work with clients and their advisers to determine an appropriate structure but this takes the form of a benchmark rather than the exact specification of the overlay portfolio we then actively manage the overlay vs that benchmark within a tightly defined set of guidelines that specify the maximum duration and curve positions we can take vs the benchmark along with the instruments we can use for example swaps gilts including repo futures sovereign credit default swaps cds or swaptions our overlay active management process builds on our proven track record in actively managing fixed income portfolios we apply the same investment process combining topdown macro views with bottomup security selection to add value for our clients however we apply only a select portion of our full toolkit of fixed income instruments in these mandates this is driven by most clients‚Äô preference to limit deviations from the ldi benchmark as well as the levered nature of the mandates leverage means that a large portion of the physical portfolio backing the overlay needs to be held in cash and liquid securities ie government bonds limiting the potential to add alpha ‚Äãapplications for ldi overlay and ldi overlay plus strategies ‚Äãmany pension funds and other institutional investors are in a position where they want a closer match to liabilities but also want to invest outside the fixed income universe to generate excess return the return requirement is often driven by the need to close funding gaps or reduce contributions this means they cannot invest all their assets in duration matching bonds ldi overlays provide a solution because only a portion of the assets needs to be allocated to this strategy in order to match liability risks this leaves the balance of the portfolio available to invest in other returnseeking assets ‚Äãrisk management  controls ‚Äãat pimco risk management has always been deeply ingrained in our investment culture and we follow a strict and thorough process regardless of the market environment to us counterparty risk is essentially the same as credit risk which gives pimco an obligation to evaluate and navigate all counterparties in the same way we manage credit risk for our clients pimco has an independent counterparty risk committee composed of senior professionals from portfolio management legalcompliance operations and credit analysis the committee maintains a list of approved counterparties and tiers them based upon financial strength our senior credit analysts each have many years of experience evaluating and analyzing corporate credits and their expertise is used to evaluate trading counterparties in addition we have collateral agreements in place with all counterparties ¬† the levered nature of the ldi overlays in isolation means there are some risks involved but these can be mitigated by properly managing and structuring the mandate first it is important to have sufficient assets backing the overlay to be able to withstand a meaningful market shock without running out of assets second there need to be safety barriers established so that action will be taken if the available assets get depleted at pimco we typically define both an initial level of leverage and a maximum level the initial level is set to build in a conservative buffer against market shocks if the market moves against the overlay eg if interest rates rise the leverage will increase as the asset value declines we define a maximum leverage level so that action will be taken when this level is reached this action is typically to move additional assets to the overlay portfolio andor restructure the overlay we generally limit leverage in ldi overlay strategies to three to four times that of collateral assets ¬† how to invest separate accounts profile disclaimer past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results the value of shares can go up as well as down the strategy may invest a portion of its assets in noneuro securities which can entail greater risks due to noneuro economic and political developments this risk may be enhanced when investing in emerging markets investment in a strategy that invests in highyield lowerrated securities will generally involve greater volatility and risk to principal than investments in higherrated securities this strategy may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes or as part of its investment strategy use of these instruments may involve
