the scs hedged opportunities fund llc the “fund” returned an estimated  net of all fees and expenses inception to date through september   scs hedged opportunities fund llc the “fund” is a multistrategy fund of hedge funds launched on september   the fund employs global research to identify and analyze both established and emerging hedge fund managers the fund’s objective is to preserve and grow capital by producing attractive longterm capital appreciation with reduced volatility and lower correlation relative to the equity markets the fund seeks to achieve strong performance relative to its peers or applicable indices through an intensive manager selection process while risk is managed through thoughtful portfolio construction and diversification across strategies geographies and sectors the fund invests substantially all of its assets in scs hedged opportunities master fund llc the “master fund” the master fund pursues the same investment objective as the fund both the fund and the master fund are registered under the investment company act of  as amended as nondiversified closedend management investment companies the third quarter market adjustments were likely due in q  but delayed by last year’s qe operations as a whole  played out in a very similar fashion to  with one major exception global financial liquidity fell significantly and was not offset by central banks in any of the three major economic regions of asia north america or europe that was a warning sign that results this quarter might reveal the weakest links in the financial system to explain a series of global events in each region over the last three quarters combined to squeeze global liquidity these events began last fall and gathered momentum and strength over the course of  it started in asia with china’s tightening measures to fight domestic inflation pressures last fall europe’s “inflationphobes” introduced a doublewhammy of monetary and fiscal tightening at the same time by raising shortterm rates for the first time since  while the politicians demanded austerity to balance budgets of near bankrupt governments of southern europe in the meantime during much of  us politicians wrangled over the debt ceiling and proposed fiscal cuts and higher taxes instead of more quantitative easing and the list goes on subsequently the united states went into a current account surplus exchina exoil with us dollars coming home as opposed to circulating through international trade and international banking systems thus confirming the draining of liquidity abroad all of these factors led us to bring in portfolio risk in areas most sensitive to a withdrawal of liquidity europe credit and emerging markets we still lost money for the quarter as our higher volatility managers which we use for upmarket capture reinforced that they are good for downmarket capture as well the good news is that our expectation for these managers fell into our range of expected outcomes and we believe that their portfolio investments still offer the potential for attractive future returns our goal throughout this crisis period is the same as it was  protect capital while generating reasonable returns so that we can buy cheap assets in chaos without limiting upside in a normal market environment easier to say than to implement but it can be done that is the magic of good hedge fund investing let us break apart our portfolio in those segments and highlight some of the techniques we use to do this    table of contents “protect capital while generating reasonable returns” technique allocate to “allweather” managers who we believe regardless of the markets will have the potential to generate solid returns our relative value suite and low net moderate gross exposure longshort equity managers serve as the primary examples year to date our relative value suite has gained over  and our lownet long short managers are performing well these managers are the equivalent of a baseball player with great onbasepercentage “buy cheap assets in chaos” technique allocate to opportunistic managers skilled in distressed assets and sector specialists these managers have lost minimal money this year these are our sluggers “capture excess returns in normal markets” technique blend skilled managers who find mispriced securities and market inefficiencies over the long term but tend to carry market and liquidity risk examples are bankruptcies complex securities litigation processes softcatalyst merger and acquisitions value equities we believe these managers have the potential to generate solid longterm returns but carry more symmetric returns relative to the shortterm market moves beta over time however they tend to capture what we call “time arbitrage” the assets they own tend to correlate to stressed markets exhibit a lehman brothers holding company bonds a current example of the time arbitrage trade is the lehman brothers holding company bonds although positive news came out on august th regarding the plan of reorganization the bonds traded down  in the third quarter after being overwhelmed by macroeconomic news and rumored selling pressure from a large fund receiving redemption requests in addition these bonds are so attractive that many large funds already own full positions in their portfolios so they could not buy incremental positions on the valuation side our managers believe with total recoveries a base case return is  with a low case of  and reasonable upside case of  on june   the lbhi bonds traded hands at a price of  on january   they changed hands at  on september  they traded at  with a plan of reorganization confirmation hearing scheduled for the first two weeks of december and cash distributions expected in

all relevant information available at the time the master fund values its portfolio the adviser andor the board will consider such information and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by a portfolio fund manager does not represent the fair value of the company’s interests in that portfolio fund although redemptions of interests in portfolio funds are subject to advance notice requirements portfolio funds typically will make available net asset value information to holders representing the price at which even in the absence of redemption activity a portfolio fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if in accordance with the terms of the portfolio fund’s governing documents it would be necessary to effect a mandatory redemption following procedures adopted by the board in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular portfolio fund the master fund would consider whether it was appropriate in light of all relevant circumstances to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to net asset value for example when a portfolio fund imposes extraordinary restrictions on redemptions or when there have been no recent transactions in portfolio fund interests the adviser may determine that it is appropriate to apply such a discount any such decision would be made in good faith and subject to the review and supervision of the board the adviser assesses the accuracy of each portfolio fund’s reported monthly net asset value using various means these may include comparing a reported valuation with one or more strategyspecific benchmarks that the adviser believes correlate with the strategy of the portfolio fund discussing the performance of the portfolio fund with the manager’s personnel or reviewing and analyzing the portfolio fund’s audited financial statements the valuations reported by the portfolio funds’ managers upon which the master fund calculates its monthend net asset value and net asset value per share may be subject to later adjustment based on information reasonably available at that time for example fiscal yearend net asset value calculations of the portfolio funds are audited by those portfolio funds’ independent public accountants during their respective fiscal year end and may be revised as a result of such audits other adjustments may occur from time to time to the extent these adjustments materially impact the master fund’s net

factors because of the limitation on rights of redemption and the fact that the shares will not be traded on any securities exchange or other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer and because of the fact that the adviser may invest the master fund’s assets in portfolio funds that do not permit frequent withdrawals and may invest in illiquid securities an investment in the master fund is highly illiquid and involves a substantial degree of risk portfolio funds are riskier than liquid securities because the portfolio funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price similarly the illiquidity of the portfolio funds may cause investors to incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the master fund during or following periods of negative performance although the master fund may offer to repurchase shares from time to time there can be no assurance such offers will be made with any regularity the master fund invests primarily in portfolio funds that are not registered under the  act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using different strategies and investment techniques including leverage that may involve significant risks these portfolio

identical securities level  — other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc level  — valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant the master fund utilized the portfolio funds’ monthend navs as of the reporting date for fair value the portfolio funds require a redemption notice and
