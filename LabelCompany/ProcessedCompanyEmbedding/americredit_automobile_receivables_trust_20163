bbbsf outlook stable fitch does not expect to rate the class e notes key rating drivers consistent credit quality the  pool displays consistent credit quality relative to recent pools based on the wa fair isaac corp fico score and internal credit scores extended term contracts  month loan terms continue to account for the majority of the pool while new vehicles total  higher than recent amcar transactions increased extendedterm contracts  contracts total  of the pool the highest concentration for the platform  is the first amcar pool rated by fitch to include month contracts totaling  performance data for these contracts is limited due to lack of seasoning however gm financial offered the month loans in this pool to obligors with stronger credit metrics given this fact and the small concentration in the pool fitch did not apply an additional stress to these loans sufficient credit enhancement initial hard credit enhancement ce is consistent with  but higher than recent transactions ce for classes a b c and d is    and  respectively excess spread has decreased to  per annum from  in  stable performance losses on gm financials managed portfolio and securitizations have been stable and relatively low supported by the currently stable economy and healthy used vehicle values contrary to other nonprime lenders recent vintage performance has not exhibited any notable weakness with losses remaining stable for  vintages to date the cumulative net loss proxy for this pool is  in line with  the last fitchrated transaction improving corporate health fitch rates gm and gm financial bbb with a positive outlook the corporate rating and recent rating outlook revision reflect the ongoing fundamental improvement in the companys core business over the past several years consistent originationunderwritingservicing afsi demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance fitch deems afsi capable of adequately servicing  legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of gm financial would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to americredit automobile receivables trust  to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses this shows a potential downgrade of two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings below bsf or possibly default under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte and touche llp the thirdparty
