limited to all cash and cash equivalents or other debt securities less total liabilities of the master fund each determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting the funds administrator calculates the net asset value once each nyse arca trading day the net asset value for a particular trading day is released after  pm et and posted at wwwwisdomtreecom to provide updated information relating to the fund for use by investors and market professionals the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative intraday value is calculated by using the prior days closing net asset value as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the value of the master funds commodity futures during the trading day the indicative intraday value will be disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse arca trading hours of  am et to  pm et the indicative intraday value is an approximate value and should not be viewed a a real time update of the net asset value critical accounting policies critical accounting policies for the funds are as follows preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and requires the managing owner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes both the fund and the master fund apply these policies that involve judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used the master fund holds a significant portion of its assets in commodity futures and us treasuries both of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with changes in fair value reported in the statements of income and expenses the use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the master funds financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price when market closing prices are not available the managing owner may value an asset of the master fund pursuant to policies the managing owner has adopted which are consistent with normal industry standards interest income on us treasuries is recognized on an accrual basis when earned discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted over the life of the us treasuries realized gains losses and changes in unrealized gain loss on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the statements of income and expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur respectively asset valuation the master fund records its commodity futures and us treasuries on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements with changes in fair value reported in the statement of income and expenses in determining fair value of us treasuries and commodity futures the fund uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement see note  to the financial statements for further information regarding this accounting policy market risk see item a  risk factors and item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a complete discussion of market risk credit risk the master fund holds two types of investments the first is long positions in futures contracts on the seventeen index commodities since the index allocates equally among the components and is rebalanced daily performance risk of the commodity futures is divided equally among the components each of the index commodities is traded on the cme group or ice exchanges the cme group and ice exchanges guarantee the performance of its outstanding commodity futures each exchange is also publicly traded and in managements opinion wellcapitalized each uses a system of margining and daily cash settlement of unrealized gains and losses in open positions which reduces counterparty risk for market participants hence management believes that the master fund faces minimal credit or counterparty risk in its futures trading and contract positions table of contents the master fund will also hold significant cash balances representing the excess of invested funds above the margin requirements for its futures positions to the extent practical the fund will hold this excess cash in shortterm us treasury obligations hence management assigns no counterparty risk to such holdings liquidity the funds do not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet their obligations the master fund meets liquidity needs in the normal course of from cash cash equivalents andor the sale of us treasuries it holds the funds liquidity needs include redeeming shares providing margin deposits for existing commodity futures the purchase of additional commodity futures and paying expenses the funds generate cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and the investments of the master fund in commodity futures could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons such conditions could prevent the master fund from promptly liquidating a position in commodity futures contractual obligations the funds contractual obligations are with the managing owner and the commodity broker management fee payments made to the managing owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of net asset value commissions paid by the master fund to the commodity broker are on a per contract halfturn basis as such the managing owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments and commissions related to halfturns or roundturns that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as net asset values are not known until a future date offbalance sheet risk in the normal course of business the funds are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk the term offbalance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that even though it does not appear on the balance sheet may result in a future obligation or loss the financial instruments used by the fund are standardized commodity futures traded on regulated exchanges and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value pursuant to the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as of the balance sheet date therefore the funds have no unrecorded liabilities relating to commodity futures however until these contracts are closed they will fluctuate in value with changing commodity prices results of operations for the period from march   to march   the fund was launched on january   at  per share and listed for trading on the nyse arca
