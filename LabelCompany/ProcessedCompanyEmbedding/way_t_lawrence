mobile phonebased platform for creating  spins he is also an associate professor in the computer science department at the university of virginia the way you present your products online has a significant impact on sales amateurlooking product shots erode consumers’ trust and could send them fleeing fortunately you don’t need to spend  on equipment or hire a professional to create beautiful product photography that will instill faith in your online store and get results in this article i’ll show you in eight simple steps how to save money on product photography and improve your store’s look and performance  camera it’s important to use a nice camera fortunately they have become very affordable you can’t go wrong with a modern digital singlelens reflex dslr model i prefer the nikon d in terms of its price vs performance tradeoff be sure to choose a camera that can capture video and invest in decent lenses i normally use a mm lens — here’s an example — which can accommodate midrange and portrait work a mm lens — here’s one from adorama — while a bit expensive is great for closeup work and jewelry product photography although it used to be that having a dslr was necessary for taking quality product photographs smartphones have dramatically changed the game the iphone  has an megapixel sensor and can produce professional grade shots it’s received glowing reviews like this one from the sydney morning herald i strongly encourage you to explore using your smartphone after you have the proper setup before committing to purchasing a higherend camera you may be surprised you may be surprised at the quality similarities between an iphone and dslr photo  lights you will need some good lights of course mother nature has a builtin option which can produce great results but the sun is fickle i like the elinchrom dlite  kit which includes two lights tripods and attachable diffuser squares while there are many photography lighting kits available what’s most important for your setup is to get lights that operate in “continuous” mode — versus flash only — as this allows using them for video as well in fact i prefer to shoot even still photographs with my lights in continuous mode as i find this makes previewing the shot easier and adds depth to the result  tripod you need to take longer exposures holding your camera by hand will produce blurry images that shoppers will not like i prefer manfrotto tripod products there are also some very functional tripods for smartphones such as the woxom slingshot  photo setup i like to shoot products in front of a continuous background — often white or neutral grey it’s a simple and professional look that is often used by major online retailers fortunately it’s simple to achieve just purchase a few rolls of craft paper and some metal clamps roll the craft paper down a long and wide table and use the clamps to attach one end of the paper to something a few feet above the table this will produce a smooth ramp place your product on the craft paper just after it comes into contact with the table craft paper and clips can make a nice doityourself product shoot setup place your setup near a big sunny window if you want natural light or in a dark room if you want to use your photo lights for about  you have a professional studio like my setup below if you’re looking for a readymade setup modahaus carries a good line of allinone tabletop photography studios the author’s custom photography setup  use a wide aperture the aperture is the opening that lets light into your camera and is specified by an “fnumber” like “f” or “f” a wide aperture small fnumber produces a narrow depth of field that makes your photos look richer and more professional i’ve found that shooting with a narrow depth of field works particularly well for product photos of electronics set the aperture on your dslr to something like “f” or “f” you will need to have your camera in “aperture priority” mode to do this check your manual these images below are from my ipad app “bokeh a book about cameras” the images illustrate the effect of a camera’s aperture on the final shot the image on the left was captured with a wide aperture and has a narrow depth of field the image on the right was from a narrow aperture and has a wide depth of field in short use a wide aperture to produce product photos with a more professional look enlarge this image wide aperture settings produce a narrow depth of field such as the image on the left narrow apertures produce a wider depth as in the image on the right  pay attention to shadows avoid harsh backlighting and other setups that cast shadows on the surface of the object keep the lights on the same side of the object as your camera or slightly off to one side  clean up a big fingerprint on your product or dust on your lens produce poor amateur results buy some microfiber rags and wipe everything down carefully before shooting  don’t be afraid the biggest obstacle to doing something new is often ourselves don’t be afraid to experiment be creative you will make a few mistakes on your way to gaining a deeper understanding of the process not only will your sales increase you will likely develop a new hobby along the way when you’re ready to delve deeper there are many wonderful books i like the art of photography by bruce barnbaum summary you are well on your way to having an outstanding photography studio your product photos will appear as if you spent thousands on them but really you did it all yourself   jason lawrence bio   •   rss feed

javascript to comment comments    cancel comment all comments moderated valid email required but will not be published name email marv conn january   reply you are well on your way to having an outstanding photography studio your product photos will appear as if you spent thousands on them but really you did it all yourself  so buy a  light kit a  dslr camera  lens and a  photo editing software and then if you can use the three of them proficiently you can do it all yourself for cheap sound good customer generated product photos that i’ve normally get suffer from two problems first lighting issues low light noise color balance issues and second product placement issues poor background too close to the background poor shot angles trying to shoot in too small of a space i agree that buying all of that equipment and learning how to use it would greatly increase the quality of most images but beyond the quality of the photography the setup of the products is normally lacking when i shoot products i normally bring an assistant to do the actual shooting and spend my time setting up the products which is very important mary wilkinson january   reply thanks for all the tips i am a bit confused in regards to the aperture the ipad photo above on the right looks much more crisp  clean the one on the left is blurry less defined you said the left one is how it should be done but how is a blurry photo more professional jason lawrence january   reply marv thanks for the feedback but don’t overlook the quality of the product photo i shot with my iphone that one required sunlight free  iphone s  that you might already own  craft paper and clamps  you are correct a good backdrop and composition are often the most important aspect of producing nice product photos and the two things most commonly overlooked i wanted to emphasize that investing in a nice camera will only get you part of the way home and that smartphone cameras are getting quite good jason lawrence january   reply mary that may not have been the best image comparison to make my point here is a better example httpblogarqspincomwpcontentuploadsshoedofexamplejpghttpblogarqspincomwpcontentuploadsshoedofexamplejpg notice that the narrow depth of field leaves only a thin part of the shoe in sharp focus other parts are rendered blurry this has the effect of drawing the viewers’ attention to a specific feature in this case the brand name of the item while creating in my opinion a more interesting and professional look thanks for asking me to clarify shocked september   reply well intentioned but simply misguided article the author knows enough to be dangerous but not enough to teach you anything beware anyone that says that an iphone will be just as good – notice the distortion of the product in the iphone shot no one selling a product will want their product distorted and no one buying photography will want the file from an iphone also his aperture advice is far from true i could go on – but i’ll just give you a word of advice get more opinions on lighting before spending  based on this articles advice sam october   reply thanks for the article jason as someone who does quite a bit of product photography i must say it’s perplexing to see you recommending a wide aperture usually the goal with the product photography is for it to be crystal clear and sharp all over eg f – f range that’s half the reason to light it artificially too so that you can have that deep focus and a low iso for maximum sharpness and zero image noise after all f like you recommended lets in so much light that you’d hardly need two big lights pointing at your product you could get away with a diffused flash or natural light anyway that’s my  cents k kelly october   reply i personally use stockxchng has a more complex image licence agreement than some of the competition though so read that carefully before you start but here are some product photos for mock ups httpproductphotoscomfreesamples nikhil november   reply you can check out all your elinchrom studio lights equipment for online shopping  arihnatdigicom mark november   reply i have to disagree with the aperture i always use f – f what you can do to bring somewhat more detail is shoot two pictures and blend them together f and f this will give even more detail and richness jan hanus november   reply i agree with marv shooting product photography is not that easy if you want to get good photos it demands some skills not just in shooting but lighting photoshop and so on if i need good affordable product photos i go to httpproductphotoscom and i get clean color accurate images for my clients alex choi january   reply i think everyone makes a valid point but it’s all relevant to the degree in which you need the photos i’m a graphic designer of almost  decades and you simply cannot substitute a reliable professional product photography service with a quick fpo work on numerous occasions i’ve done what the author describes but not for my final printonline product image although i use photoshop everyday i am by no means an expert like my photographer is they have color calibrated monitors that help them achieve color correctness that i simply cannot achieve… reliable photographers know how to use their tools of trade and i like to leave the tast to the expert like couple of the reviewers above i use  product photos… httpwwwproductphotoscom they’ve been very reliable and cost effective for my design shop we ship the products we need photographed and in a few days we have highresolution images that we can use for our clients greg dorney march   reply i am a professional product photographer and i am currently writing a book on this subject the information above is not at all accurate please do not invest in equipment based on its advice it mentions that jason lawrence ‘ is a computer scientist researcher educator and entrepreneur having cofounded arqspin a mobile phonebased platform for creating  spins he is also an associate professor in the computer science department at the university of virginia’ it does not mention anywhere that he is a product photographer taking high quality product shots at home is most definitely achievable but the kit and methods required to do so are based on the type of products your shooting and how big you require the images to be without getting into too much detail corrections to the above article do not feel the need to buy manfrotto tripods buy the cheapest tripod that will hold your camera steady  bucks might well do the job instead of  your not shooting in a hurricane in your home keeping the kids from knocking the camera over will more likely be the issue even an expensive manfrotto can’t overcome stuff like that use the smallest aperture at your disposal on a camera phone this does generally not apply it probably will soon enough though this is to achieve maximum detail throughout the image focus rd the way into your product and shoot it at maximum aperture and you have the most detailed shot you can get of it fact technical reasons make this happen but its the same with every camera every lens and every product so make sure to do it lighting goodness if only it was so simple lighting your product depends on your product i have lit literally hundreds of thousands of shots and believe me lighting can come from any and every angle i would love to be able to explain all about product photography in eight simple points but it is taking me a long illustrated book to do so as there are may products there are in turn many ways to shoot them jason i applaud you trying to help retailers get their images online but next time please consult a subject matter expert before throwing in some expensive brands bad information and leading people in the wrong direction john march   reply going to disagree on the fstop f would be my recommendation if you want the details of the product preserved small fstops are for arty shots and blur effects bokeh otherwise good advice jeff delacruz may   reply hey jason i think the article is great i don’t nessesarily agree with everything ie using continuous light fstop but what i do think is that most people would get pretty good shot from this and would definitely learn something i think some people have been a little heavy handed here but i appreciate what your doing thanks jeff delacruz httpwwwpowphotographycom zcasavant june   reply i found it interesting that you start out talking about dslr cameras then switch to smartphone cameras there’s a huge world in between there’s are a ton of midrange cameras that produce amazing images compared to smartphones but are way cheaper than a slr a mpx zoom camera will smoke a smartphone in image quality andespecially zoom capability… and cost in the mid range these cameras have the advantage of having real apertures optical not digital zoom and shutter control so you can play with them and learn the relationship this is very important if you want to be serious about photographing smartphone cameras are not designed for professional photographs although i agree their quality has gone up dramatically also all of the technology going into smartphone lensesimage software will obviously go into cameras too so a good camera is a worthy investment for much less  the only advantage i can see for a smartphone is the potential for photoediting apps that you can use in realtime… but then on that tiny screen i’d say that might be a risk if you really care about your images anyway for those with a more limited budget who really truly want to learn to photograph… get a midrange camera just my  cents  safak karaca november   reply dear jason my name is safak and i am living istanbul turkey i have been searching for building a home based prodcut photography studio i have two questions if you answer me i would be appreciated my first question is about the strobe power i am planning to but an elinchrom strobe kit but i don’t know how much power do i need i am gonna shoot prodcut photographs and still life photographys there is a watt kit  elincyhrom brx  is it too much for me please advice me and my second question is about the aperture i read your article and you are talking about suing wide aperture is better but on the other hand if you apply narrow aperture then you get more depth of field and it means you have bigger focused area in your pictures am i right let’s pretent i wanna shoot a wrist watch with my mm macro lens  and i need the whole face of this watch to be sharp if i use a wide aperture then i could get sharpness on only a part of the face right so it would be bad for me can you explain me this i am waitng your reply thank you safak clipping path december   reply hi you listed a point “don’t be afraid” i feel enjoy to take photos but why i will be afraid lol excellent writing

help httpjmsvintagetsetsycom luke february   reply great little tutorial for product shots thank you for sharing if i had to be picky rule  shouldn’t be a rule at all as only certain types of product pics benefit from bokeh the rule is completely backwards for most of my product shots robert may   reply sir is there any room in the market for any more placement photographs  jessica june   reply

right now please try again later out of  starsgeometry reviewbyomar l hacallaron november  format paperbackverified purchasethis book primarily covers plane geometry which is the bulk of a traditional geometry course books back in the day covered more with dihedral angles and proofs in dimensions this book covers the essence proofs that range from  to  to  steps as i encountered i like the examples and the problems are not directly the same so they dont exactly regurgitate and to me that is learning congruent triangles proving a quadrilateral is a parallelogram rhombus so forth is covered extensively each chapter has exercises at the end of the chapter with review problems theres only solid geometry on spheres cylinders cubes and prismsthey ask you to calculate the surface area and volume there is also calculations on the volume of a cone they dont however go into calculating surface area lateral area of cones or composite figures hemispheres attached to cylinders or areas of pyramids inscribed in cones or area of a circus tent story problems cylinders attached to cones thats my major gripe im very fastidious for education and a consumer i give this book  stars not  if this was added i would have given great study tool better exercises than watered down books this is not even a text book thats what makes it so unique a student will succeed from most geometry books with this book ample examples i guarantee it you have to put the time in though and understand the material not just memorize you have to apply the concepts investigate analyze and use reasoning now

guarantee contact can a breakthrough new supplement bring your erections to their maximum hardness adult stars secret to keeping it up at any age   dear friend i have a question for you its about hardness think about how hard you were able to get in your younger years not when you were in your s but even before then when you were in your s and able to get it up no matter what now tell me by john lawrence professional adult star and creator of phgh how much better was sex for you at that time how much more enjoyable was it for you without the stress of not being able to get it up and how much better was your relationship knowing you could give your girl the assurance that shes the one of you if you are like most men you would probably say the sex you would have with a full hard erection at full arousal would be the best sex you could ever possible have now i want you to put that thought aside and consider the type of sex adult stars are able to have on set as you know theres a lot of pressure on set when male stars are required to keep it up on set the entire time do you think this is natural sure they have some natural ability but i can tell you that natural ability quickly fades what many adult stars dont want you to know is that they do not natually keep it up on set they use supplements to do it and here i would like to tell you how its done and how you can do it just like they do  with your maximum full erection that makes sex better than youve ever had before right now today my name is john lawrence you may know me as an a male pornstar whos starred in over  films here im going to reveal the secret that allowed me to do it and if youre serious about getting bigger harder erections that make women crazy for youregardless of your size or even if you cant get it up then this may be the most important letter you ever read the reason i created phgh was because the other pills stopped working for me this was a very hard time for me because i so desparately needed something to keep me performing at my best in my adult career during that time i researched hundreds of different ingredients and other male enhancement formulas in an attempt to figure out something that would work for me what i discovered was shocking what i found was most male enhancement pills are severely lacking in the key components that make them effective and today i want to share with you those very things to make sure you dont get ripped off by a low quality supplement here are a few of the serious problems many male enhancement products have many supplements are completely devoid of any ingredients that actually work   others contain ingredients in such minuscule amounts they are useless  often the quantity listed on their label is much higher than the amount actually in the capsule some illegally contain elements of pharmaceutical drugs unknown to the user many use only powdered versions of certain ingredients instead of using extracts which is the only way to provide enough of the active elements to actually work even the supplements which claim to contain extracts often use invalid extraction processes which render the active ingredients essentially useless many other supplements do not employ a testing lab to verify the chemical composition of their products and the manufacturers often have no idea what their capsules contain every supplement contains binders and fillers called excipients but many of my competitors use potentially harmful excipients such as methyl paraben microcrystalline cellulose methacrylic copolymer corn starch or talcum powder other products use unreliable suppliers who have no quality control procedures in place in many cases my competitors use only one active ingredient to remedy mens sexual health  in fact there are  active ingredients which help in this matter and because all men respond differently to each compound it is essential to use all five ingredients when i became aware that most other manufacturers routinely used these unscrupulous practices i decided to take no shortcuts and develop a pure and untainted formula i wanted a premium product and i would use only the highest standards of quality at every level  as soon as i made this decision i knew it would be a huge undertaking  i also knew it would be much more expensive to produce a higher quality product  but my personal experience with not being able to perform had given me insight into just how significant the problem is  in fact theres not a word in the dictionary which truly captures the feeling of helplessness in that situation or how desperately i wanted to find a solution you see i created phgh because other products were just not working for me  and i desperately needed something to work  so i made it my personal priority that my formula would ensure the highestquality product on the market  i genuinely wanted to help other men who were going through the miserable experience i had gone through why phgh is the most effective and highestquality product on the market  phgh uses only ingredients that come from their native regions  i personally developed close and lasting relationships with chinese herbalists and with tribesmen in indonesia to ensure i was getting the highest quality epimedium and tongkat ali straight from the source  i still rely on these men for my raw ingredients  i follow this same procedure for every ingredient in my unique formula  there are five herbal compounds which help to maximize mens sexual health  these are all included in the formula for phgh but most other supplements use only one or maybe two at most  what is crucial to understand is that these five compounds must all work together to achieve maximum results do not buy any supplement lacking even one of the following fiveingredients tribulus terrestris  a potent herb which serves to instigate the production of testosterone a crucial chemical in terms of the male sex drive itself arginine  an amino acid which boosts the level of nitric oxide in your blood  when your nitric oxide levels are higher your blood vessels are more relaxed…and consequently blood flows more freely to the right places tongkat ali  this herb has been used by tribesmen in indonesia for centuries to boost testosterone and to stimulate dopamine production in the brain which in turn boosts libido epimedium aka horny goat weed  an ancient chinese herb which also helps to open up blood vessels and maximize bloodflow directly to where its needed maca  another rare folk medicine which increases volume of semen as well as sperm count and also contributes to increased libido you see there are actually quite a few conditions that contribute to male sexual difficulties and its often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause  the compounds in these herbs each target different systems in our bodies  for that reason an effective male supplement must contain all five of the above ingredients  phgh is made with all five  i have also developed quite a close relationship with the lab that manufactures tests and analyzes my product  the biochemists at this lab have several duties regarding phgh they test and verify that the herbal extracts do in fact consist of the chemical compounds theyre supposed to contain the active components that increase libido  accelerate bloodflow they test and confirm that the milligram amount of the ingredients listed on the label of phgh corresponds exactly to the actual milligram amount contained in each capsule once the chemical composition is confirmed they manufacture the capsules using only binding agents or fillers that do not contain any impurities or possible carcinogens warning never buy any supplement containing the following binders or fillers methyl paraben microcrystalline cellulose methacrylic copolymer corn starch talcum powder when i began to shop around for labs to test my first homemade batches of phgh i encountered several lab managers who immediately started trying to convince me to use some of these cheaper fillers  they said it was standard in the industry insisting that the actual quality of the supplement was of very little concern  they stressed over and over that only the marketing mattered  it turns out that most other products do use these potentially dangerous fillers these same lab managers also tried to pitch me on yet another proposition they suggested adding a few milligrams of the little blue pharmaceutical pill to my formula  now i knew this was illegal but more importantly i knew it was extremely dangerous to combine this drug with other medications  these laboratory managers also knew this of course but they insisted it was a very common practice and that there was no way to get caught i rejected these unscrupulous offers and walked out of those labs right away  i kept searching until i finally found a laboratory with not only high standards of quality control and scientific rigor but a high degree of integrity as well  i knew i could trust these men  when we made the agreement to start production i added two clauses that were nonnegotiable  phgh will never use any cheap or possibly dangerous fillers to cut costs  the formula must remain exactly as i created it and illegal drugs shall never be used under any conditions the phgh mission our  priority is helping men take their libidos to their highest level giving them full hard erections at any age finally id like to mention a feature of phgh that i often neglect due to my emphasis on the five essential active ingredients in the formula such as tribulus or epimedium one of the additional elements is a naturally occurring chemical called piperine  now this is an alkaloid compound which by itself has no direct connection to the male sex drive  however piperine has been found to inhibit drug metabolism and increase the availability of various other compounds  it sounds complex but simply piperine makes other chemicals work better in your body  thats the reason i included it in the formula…because it enhances and maximizes the work that the other active ingredients are doing to open blood vessels and stimulate certain hormones in your brain im confident that all the effort has paid off  i truly believe i have created the highestquality and most effective male enhancement supplement yet  i did it without cutting corners and i kept one thing first and foremost in my mind helping men have better lives if there is any reason whatsoever that you feel dissatisfied with your order within the first full month you can rest secure and trust in my  moneyback guarantee  there will be no questions asked and no hassel i have personally gone through the fear of failure that accompanies not being able to perform and ive experienced the humiliation and damage to my selfesteem it creates but there is one thing i can say to you with certainty theres hope for the futurefor a satisfying and even amazing sex life but dont just take my word for it  one bottle of phgh can start the transformation that will radically transform your libido  youve got nothing to lose except your fear of failure but youve got everything to gain by giving it a shot quite possibly the best sex of your life sincerely john lawrence other companies use wild claims…i will never make claims above

your influences sources of inspiration or favorite authors  artists  after about  years of living i began to notice that my life hasnt turned out quite the way i planned i thought id be rich or at least handsome incredibly successful and deliriously happy all the time isnt that what we all expected on top of being thoroughly average ive experienced some of the worse things life has to offer ive lived with chronic arthritis for more than  years and have had surgery to replace all the major joints in my body my wife and i have three wonderful kidsbut one of them went to heaven after only five months on earth none of this was supposed to happen to me my life was going to be different life seldom turns out exactly as planned and most of us have experienced some form of trauma from sexual abuse to chronic illness to betrayal to failure to grief nearly everyone has had some reason to say this isnt the life i had in mind thats why jerry brecheisen and i teamed up to write when life doesnt turn out the way you expect between his brain tumor removed and my prostheses implanted we know something about navigating unexpected twists in the road of life and based on our more than  years of pastoral experience weve identified some insights from gods word for those who suffer but the book isnt about us the heroes of our story are the nine real men and women who have shared theirs tales of trauma and recovery weve spoken to average people who have learned how to overcome sexual abuse forgive an unfaithful spouse face each day with chronic pain and rise above moral and professional failure to a person they offer the same affirmation god can heal your broken heart     anything else youd like readers  listeners to know  no matter who you are or what you have suffered
