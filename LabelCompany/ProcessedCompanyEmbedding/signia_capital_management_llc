value strategy small companies large opportunitiesthe smallmicro cap segment of the market represents approximately  of the stock market by capitalization but it includes almost half of the total number of publicly traded securities  as a result of its small relative size many investors overlook this segment of the market however over time the smallmicro cap segment has produced strong returns relative to the overall marketour smallmicro cap value equity strategy invests in high quality catalyst rich companies that we expect will experience a significant improvement in earnings within the next  to  months our team identifies compelling investment opportunities through a rigorous bottom up research process that includes direct dialogue with the management teams of each company under considerationthe process results in a concentrated portfolio of  to  ideas each with its own unique and compelling investment catalyst signia smallmicro cap fact sheetsignia smallmicro cap midqtr update concentrated value strategy best ideas best results our extensive investment experience leads us to believe that outperformance is driven by the highest conviction ideas within a portfolio as a result we believe that a concentrated portfolio consisting of high conviction catalyst rich investments is the best way to generate significant returns relative to the rest of the market research shows that active portfolio manager’s best ideas tend to outperform the rest of the positions within their portfolio and concentrated portfolios tend to outperform more diversified actively managed portfolios furthermore as portfolios move beyond  securities the risk reduction benefit as measured by standard deviation declines materially our concentrated value strategy invests in  to  individual securities that we believe possess compelling company specific catalysts the investments in this strategy are expected to generate significant price appreciation over the next  to  months the strategy is unconstrained by market capitalization ranges allowing the team to select the very best investment opportunities regardless of market capitalizationsignia concentrated value fact sheetsignia
