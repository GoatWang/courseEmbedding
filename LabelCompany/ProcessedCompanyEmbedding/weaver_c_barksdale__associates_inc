invests primarily in investment grade short term debt securities and has a target duration of  to  years it is intended for investors seeking an alternative to traditional money market funds time deposits or shortterm investments while protecting principalthis strategy has the potential to generate higher returns than traditional cash investments because of a relatively modest increase in
