lockheedmartin chief marillyn hewson is the highest paid female ceo so far this year andrew harrerbloomberg equal pay day which occurred on tuesday highlights how much of a salary gap still exists between men and women in the workplace but at least a few female ceos arent having trouble earning their worth a usa today analysis reported wednesday morning shows that the highestpaid female ceo among companies that have released their proxy since the start of the year is lockheed martins marillyn hewson the chief executive of the aerospace and defense giant saw her total pay package for  grow to  million according to the companys proxy in terms of total compensation that puts her at the top of all female ceos in the standard  poors stock index that have filed so far in addition according to usa todays analysis it makes her the only woman among the top  ceo earners again for companies that have already released their data a company spokesperson declined to comment further about hewsons compensation but as usa today noted investors probably wont raise too many concerns lockheed martins stock rose some  percent in  far better than the sp  notably a few companies with female ceos have yet to file their data this year including yahoo general motors and oracle we do have a sense of what theyre likely to pay though based on previous figures yahoo filed its proxy last year in late april which showed that ceo marissa mayer made  million in  gm said early last year that mary barra would make about  million in  and oracles safra catz who was named coceo in september and made more than  million as president in the companys last fiscal year could eventually top hewsons pay among companies that already have filed proxies this calendar year the next two highestpaid female ceos after hewson are pepsicos indra nooyi whose total compensation for  was valued at  million and xeroxs ursula burns whose was valued at  million such numbers reflect what ceos stand to make but not necessarily their annual takehome pay the big boost in hewsons  compensation came from a change in her pension value which rose by nearly  million — or nearly half of her total pay package the difference was big enough that lockheed like a growing number of companies created a separate column in the companys pay table for the amount she earned without the pension value change which was only  million yet while companies may want to separate those numbers investors tend to think the whole picture is more valuable said john roe executive director of iss corporate solutions many institutional investors think the change in pension should be included because it includes a real cash payout ceos will take with them when they retire he said in an interview with the post hewsons not the only one to see her pension value shift significantly this year due to changes in the actuarial tables for ceos life expectancies as well as continued low interest rates this is proving to be the largest pension adjustment year in the history of executive pay since disclosures were required in  roe said within at least  companies this year he said the change in pension value was actually greater than all the other elements of the ceos pay combined read also the worst question you could ask women in a job interview like on leadership follow us on facebook and twitter and subscribe to

and follow the charts with that id like to turn the call over to marillyn marillyn hewson thanks greg good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our second quarter results and our increased outlook for  as todays release illustrates we had strong results this quarter operationally and financially our strong year to date financial performance also enabled us to increase our full year  guidance for sales operating profit and earnings per share these results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across our businesses in providing critical products and services to our customers while returning outstanding value to stockholders it was particularly noteworthy that our quarterly cash flows exceeded last years second quarter by nearly  million when we adjust for the  million of isgs cash that was included in the  results our team continues to progress toward our full year objective in growth in sales eps and cash from operations and i thank our team for their dedication to our mission chris will cover the financial results in detail a little later however i want to touch on two events which occurred after our accounting quarter closed that point to the strength of our portfolio and the significant growth opportunities they provide first in our rotary and mission systems business area our sikorsky line of business secured a  billion five year contract for  black hawk helicopters to be delivered to the us army as well as to the saudi arabian national guard this award marks sikorsky’s ninth multiple year contract with the us government and includes options for an additional  aircraft bringing the potential value to over  billion we are honored to have the opportunity to continue providing rotary aircraft in support of the important missions of the us army and our international customer second our aeronautics business area received an f award on lrip  which includes funding for  us jets and totaled nearly  billion this brings the total quantity of us aircraft authorized for lrip  to  planes a growth of  fighter jets from lrip  us government order and represents a  increase from the prior lot we anticipate a separate order  a separate award later this quarter which will add additional aircraft for our international f partners and foreign military sales customers the recent us award demonstrates continued evidence of the strong support the f has earned and we look forward to finalizing these contracts as we progress to full rate production turning briefly to defense budgets the fy dod budget appropriations have been enacted and were consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement of  bringing defense department base funding to approximately  billion as well as overseas contingency operations funding to about  billion we’re pleased to see that our programs continue to be well supported as seen by the legislation increasing f aircraft and black hawk helicopter quantities the higher levels for both the base and oco budgets reflect a growing level of bipartisan recognition of rising global security threats and the need for additional budget resources the additional funding for fy will help begin to address some of the acute budget needs to recapitalize our defense assets and respond to the global security environment also the president released his request for the fy dod budget this included  billion for the base budget an increase of nearly  from the fy appropriations and  from the prior presidential base budget submission additionally both the house and senate armed services committees have released their fiscal year ’ national defense authorization act markups both of which greatly exceeded the presidents request and the house has since passed their version by a wide margin while we recognize  why we realize that these proposals exceed the current budget caps we are encouraged to see the recognition that our defense budgets require increased levels of funding we are hopeful that bipartisan agreement can be reached to rescind or modify the budget caps and fund our military at the levels needed to address the current set of world threats moving on id like to highlight several operational successes we achieved on our f program and then briefly comment on the recent historic announcements from the us and kingdom of saudi arabia governments to bolster global security the program featured two milestones that highlight the growing international nature of the joint strike fighter the first japanese assembled fa conventional takeoff and landing variant was unveiled at the final assembly and checkout or faco facility in nagoya japan this aircraft marks the first of nearly  jets that will be produced for the japanese ministry of defense at this location similarly the first fb variant to be assembled outside the united states was rolled out in italy from the cameri faco facility cameri has already delivered multiple fa versions and is slated to produce over  aircraft in total together these two events underscore the benefits of the multinational partnerships that have been forged as we work to provide fifth generation capabilities to both us and coalition forces keeping with the f program we were also proud to spotlight our fa at the paris air show last month the ctol variant performed its inaugural aerial demonstration showcasing its aerobatic maneuvering and the jet’s raw power to climb and run i watched along with the rest of the amazed crowd at the le bourget airport as the aircraft flawlessly executed  degree climbs remarkable angle of attack displays and several unique moves that only a fifth generation fighter could accomplish all of which shine a bright light on the impressive capabilities this unrivaled stealth fighter provides as the crowd erupted into applause i could not have been more proud of what our lockheed martin team together with the us government the jpo organization international partners industry teammates and hundreds of suppliers have been able to accomplish before i conclude id like to take a moment to say a few words about the unprecedented announcements that president trump and his majesty king salman of the kingdom of saudi arabia made in riyadh in may as part of those announcements the kingdom expressed its intent to procure more than  billion worth of lockheed martin products and services including air and missile defense products such as thaad batteries and pac missiles multimission surface combatant ships variants of our littoral combat ship cj aircraft and various other defense related capabilities and solutions these announcements reflect the strength of the relationship that our corporation has built with the kingdom over the past  years in addition the request touched each of our four business areas demonstrating the breadth and depth of our offerings and the growth potential that our portfolio brings finally i would like to acknowledge our space systems team as they mark the one year anniversary of the juno spacecraft orbiting the planet jupiter images from the juno orbiter graced the cover of the may issue of science magazine delivering breathtaking views of the giant planet’s polar region the mission also included measurements of the magnetic and gravitational fields and unique perspectives on the atmospheric and weather environments of jupiters surface scientists are excited at the initial in depth results being provided as well as with the potential new discoveries that may be made in the upcoming experiments we believe our continuous commitment to innovation and our long term partnership with nasa have contributed to these remarkable achievements and we are proud to be a part of this ambitious undertaking i’ll now turn the call over to bruce to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail and then well open up the line for your question bruce tanner thanks marillyn and good morning everyone ill be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today let’s begin with chart three and an overview of our results we’re pleased with our performance in the quarter sales of  billion were slightly ahead of our expectations and showed solid growth over last years results our operating profit and earnings per share results were also ahead of our expectations while cash from operations was in line with what we were expecting we continued our strong cash deployment actions and we increased our full year outlook for sales operating profit and earnings per share so we had a very solid second quarter and a nice rebound from some of the performance issues we had in the first quarter on chart four we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last years results sales were  billion higher this quarter compared with the last year with most of that growth coming from the aeronautics and space systems business areas aeronautics growth was driven by higher volume from the f and c programs and an additional c delivery this quarter compared with last year space systems growth was driven by the inclusion of the atomic weapons establishment sales in the quarter compared with none in the second quarter of last year segment operating profit was  million higher this quarter compared to last year this was driven by higher volume and improved performance of the f program and aeronautics improved performance across multiple lines of business within rms and these were partially offset by lower equity earnings from united launch alliance and space systems turning to chart five we’ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter eps from continuing operations of  was about  higher than the results from a year ago reflecting both higher operating earnings and lower share count this year compared with last year on chart six well compare our cash from operations this quarter versus our results from  we generated more than  billion of cash in the quarter over  million more than we did in the second quarter of last year but as marillyn said in her remarks that understates our relative performance as last years results included around  million of cash generated by isgs which was not divested until august of last year on a year to date basis our  billion of cash generated is also about  million higher than our results from the first half of  but last years amount included nearly  million of cash generated by isgs chart seven shows the cash returns to stockholders in the quarter subtracting capital expenditures in the quarter from our cash from operations our free cash flow was just under  billion and we returned slightly more than  billion to stockholders about equally split between share repurchases and dividends this cash deployment represents  of our free cash flow in the quarter on chart eight we want to make you aware of two large awards that took place shortly after the end of the quarter that are not reflected in our reported backlog level the largest award was for the f lrip  uca for domestic aircraft that marillyn mentioned and was worth  billion the second award was for the multiyear ix by black hawk helicopters and was worth  billion both of these awards occurred within two weeks after the quarter close and their combined values would have pushed our backlog above  billion for the quarter had they occurred just a few days earlier chart nine provides our updated outlook for the year we increased sales by  million with all of that increase coming from the space systems business due to the higher volume were seeing this year we increased segment operating profit by  million with  million of the increase coming from our aeronautics business and  from space systems aeronautics increase recognizes better than planned performance so far this year while the space systems increase is primarily volume driven we had an improvement in our unallocated costs worth  million driven mostly by a reduction to a previously established reserve while these improvements in our  with these improvements in our operating profit we increased our earnings per share by  and lastly we’re maintaining our cash from operations outlook at equal to or greater than  billion charts  and  show our revised outlooks by business area for both sales and segment operating profit i covered the revisions in the outlook in the prior discussions chart  provides a reconciliation of our prior eps outlook to our current outlook the  million increase in segment operating profit increases our expected eps by about  while the  million decrease in unallocated expense improves the eps by around  resulting in a revised outlook for the year of  to  this new range is higher than the guidance we provided when we began this year more than offsetting the setbacks we experienced in the first quarter finally we have our summary on chart  our quarter results for sales profit eps and cash from operation were all either in line or ahead of our expectations that resulted in the increased outlook that we just discussed we are well positioned to achieve our full year goals and as we look ahead to the third quarter earnings call well provide our initial trend information for  as a reminder the new revenue recognition rule will be effective for us starting in january and will be incorporated into our trend information with that were ready for your questions john questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions first we go to the line of sam pearlstein with wells fargo please go ahead sam pearlstein good morning bruce always a lot of focus on the cash flow and theres been a lot of discussion about the capital spending at various defense contracts your capex is certainly up over the last few years and up yearoveryear how should we think about that in future years and whats going to dictate that is this f volume or the contract wins or losses like tx what’s going to dictate kind of the levels of capex we see over the next few years bruce tanner sam thanks for that question it’s a good question as we looked at our long range planning from last year that covers basically  ’ and ’  is sort of a peak in terms of the capital expenditures for the corporation and that reflects a number of things some restructuring that were doing within our space systems business moving some of the work around within locations within space systems and also reflects the last tranche of investments required to get the f sort of fully capitalized it increased in i’ll say between  and maybe years prior to going forward because we added sikorsky into the portfolio which obviously has higher capital expenditure requirements than did the isgs business which really had practically immaterial capital expenditure requirements so if you start to sort of think of  as sort being the high point at least as we look at it today going forward we would expect that number to slightly decrease going forward and within that slight decrease going forward there are some requirements for additional new capital for some of the wins one of which you describe in your question but thats sort of more than offset by the reductions in the other capital expenditures required including f operator our next question is from noah poponak with goldman sachs please go ahead noah poponak hey good morning everyone bruce how should we think about aeronautics organic revenue growth in  just because now you are going to have a pretty tough just growth comparison you’ll have more f growth but you had mentioned before other aircraft in the segment being headwinds not sure if those have moved around and then if you could just perhaps tie that into  a few quarters ago you talked about staying in the  to  total company growth range but  maybe being at the low end of that just wanted to check back in if that was still sort of the case thanks bruce tanner thanks noah so aero’s organic growth i think what i said previously or what you said that i said previously in earlier quarters still is true today were still looking  i’ll probably answer your second question first were still looking at the total company about the  to  growth going forward and ’ is a little less than that and actually in ’ as we sit here today it probably picks back up and a lot of that is because as  to your first question in  were actually seeing a drop off because we have the end of the f production line at least based on current orders at the end of our  close to the end of  we have no new production fs planned for  as we sit here today and thats not in the numbers that weve talked about previously we also have the end of the c program in the early part of  and so those two events are kind of bringing down aeronautics organic growth you’re still seeing tremendous growth potential in both the production and sustainment programs for aeronautics for the f program but the other two are slightly as i said dissipating some of that growth and thats one of the reasons why in  we kind of bounce back as were operating off of a lower compare if you will in  operator our next question is from howard rubel with jefferies please go ahead howard rubel thank you very much i want to change a little bit from operations talk strategy for a moment and theres two things related one marillyn youve started to make some investments outside of your core that look like they are complementary and maybe you could address that and talk about how significant a commitment it could be and then related to that is from a longerterm point of view you have to think about people and what are going on there and how do you think about succession planning marillyn hewson excellent questions howard things that i  both of which i have spent a lot of time on on a regular basis so thank you for the question from the strategy standpoint our focus is on growth weve been very clear about that we think weve got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow we see our international growth increasing from what today is about   in  was about  of our sales  and we’ll continue to see that growth the demand around the world is high for not only f but missile defense one of our f cs other defensive systems that we have as well as our opportunities in space based situational awareness et cetera so that growth we have been  in terms of your comment about outside our core the complementary i would say that our commercial satellites our commercial helicopters those that we’re doing with the lmj which is the commercial version of the c those are absolutely areas to move in commercial but very closely aligned and then of course the hybrid airship is another opportunity for us so those all are in line with our core competences and our capabilities but moving into similar  more into the commercial space and aligning with that long term were always focused on our talent management our talent development it is an ongoing part of our business and in terms of succession planning as you look at the leadership team that we have at lockheed martin very seasoned very strong talented team that is  that im really proud to be a part of the team and working collectively with them on how we’re executing our strategy for the corporation but at all times we’re looking at building that pipeline of talent into the business and yes we also look at that talent from the standpoint of its diversity and so im proud to say that  of our leaders are women and we continue to bring more talent in from that regard so succession planning is something that we continue to look at as a company and its an ongoing effort for us thanks for the question operator and next we go to rob spingarn with credit suisse please go ahead rob spingarn good morning i wanted to ask as you go into next year and we think about  going back to the cash flow sam asked about the capex and you talked i think at the tail end of last quarter about trying to  expension contribution perhaps cash flow could be  operating cash flow could be flattish with this year bruce does that still work with the multiyear on the black hawk and the quantity adjustments that are happening there and any other new incremental information that we have since last time bruce tanner i think the answer is no it doesnt change rob as far as our thinking is concerned relative to the way youve described  sans pension contribution i would expect operating cash flow for the corporation to look pretty similar to this year and again we talked about after those pension contributions both in  and  but if you add the cash from those years along with  we expect to be in excess of  billion were off to a great start obviously this year in  and we’ll give you more insight into what were looking for ’ and maybe a little beyond as we talk to you on the next quarter call operator our next question is from ron epstein with banc of america merrill lynch please go ahead ron epstein good morning guys i just want to maybe talk about some business opportunities the first of which would be the tx and jstars hows that going and when would you expect a decision made on those marillyn hewson sure i’ll take those we’re looking at where the air force is and tx and jstars they’re looking at  they’ve set an award in the fourth quarter of this year obviously we never know until they actually do it and so we couldnt say but thats what theyve outlined is the fourth quarter of  for jstars and tx and then we see some other near term awards that were hoping to see in september october timeframe ones like the special operations forces global logistics support services that we’re unencumbered on that today and us being  it’s in competition and we hope to see that award it’s got total program value with options of up to  billion our ground based strategic defense is another one that we would look to have to see an award coming here in the fourth quarter and were hoping as we look at the saudi operations the opportunity that we have there that potentially we could see a fat award sometime late in the year early next year and then another would be lrso the longrange standoff missile that is also looking at september timeframe and let’s see another would be the saudis are looking at getting the search and rescue and si helicopter award that we expect in september timeframe as well so several awards in the near term i think i rattled off six or seven of them just there and so were excited and bruce you have some other thoughts bruce tanner yes just maybe one to address the question of the star  the start of your question ron you should think of most of these as weve already submitted the proposals so you sort of ask whats the status well the status is i think were all sort of waiting and for the most part the government is evaluating ours along with everyone elses proposal and we sit anxiously waiting to see the results of that but theres not much we can do at this point as i said because almost every one of the ones that marillyn  if not all of them that marillyn just rattled off for  weve already submitted the proposals for those operator our next question is from doug harned with bernstein please go ahead finbar sheehy hi its finbar sheehy for doug in your press release you talked about higher sustainment activities in the quarter for the f can you talk to us about how big those are now relative to total f revenues and how you expect thats going to evolve over the next few years maybe how big a percentage of f revenues will sustainment be say by the end of the decade and how do margins on sustainment compare to the incremental margins you are getting now on new aircraft bruce tanner i’ll trying that finbar so sustainment is growing fairly rapidly i mean i want to say its not quite growing this year at the same pace as is production but its growing dramatically over last years numbers i mean you should think of this as in the sort of high teens sorts of numbers so its growing incrementally and itll continue to do that for a number of years as we set up more and more bases both around the united states but as well internationally as international customer start letting down the aircraft in their home location so that growth is going to continue i dont have the exact split but i want to say if you look at sustainment out of the total f production i want to say its probably   as large as the production volume on an annual basis something like that and it stays at those sorts of levels for the next few years so as production grows over the next couple of years to its peak when we hit full rate production i would expect that the sustainment will sort of follow suit there and then your last question finbar was relative to the margins and how we do on sustainment contracts and i’ll tell you we do about the same on the f sustainment as we do on production that might change somewhat in the future going forward but at least historically and where we sit today theyre pretty comfortable without a whole lot of difference between them operator next we go to seth seifman with jpmorgan please go ahead seth seifman thanks very much and good morning i wanted to ask about the sar that came out last week and the change in peak quantity of the air force buy in the out years it came down from  to  but were talking about numbers that are pretty far out there in   time frame so im wondering how you are looking at that what implications you think it might have whether its a change that you expect to stick around marillyn hewson i’ll take that seth thanks for the question i would just say first off we havent really seen the sar i mean we know that its been submitted to congress we know theres been top level readout from the jpo but the fact sheet that came out on it and i think in that the joint program office highlighted the fact that the reason that the numbers were changing were predominantly due to a change in the procurement profile of the air force jets which is the largest volume buyer for the air force and  but frankly we just  i know that in my discussions with the air force theres a desire to buy as many as they can as quickly as they can so i havent got an official position from them that they’ve reduce their procurement profile that just happens to be whats in that select acquisition report that came out going i mean certainly lots of opportunity to change the quantities as you can see just with whats in the budget deliberations right now the adds that are coming forward on the f for the various services we think its still in  we’ll still see potentially some upside on it so that would be my take bruce anything you want to add bruce tanner another thing i might offer just for a little perspective i think you had it right seth in that the planned peak volumes for the usaf are sort of far out there right now just to give you some perspective on that were still in discussions with the joint program office relative to a potential block buy and the numbers that have been thrown out for that block buy and this is just again to put some perspective over three lrips is about  and  between  and think of it as five   or so aircraft over that three year lrip period so nearly  aircraft per year and thats what were talking about for lrips   and  so these are literally right around the corner that’s  aircraft with the usaf buying  aircraft in each of those three fiscal years so the cut to  to  were not even approaching the  yet and were building aircraft of quantities of  per fiscal year so as marillyn said a lot of opportunities to change quantities between now and then and it will be interesting once we do see the full sar report how much of that was sort of budgetarily really driven with the potential to change that budget that much that further  that far out excuse me versus i’ll say a quantity difference and if i read the fact sheet right actually from the jpo i think the actual total quantity of us government buys for fs went up coincidentally enough by about  aircraft for additional marine corps buys so pushing up to the right but again as marillyn said lots of opportunity to change those values between now and then operator our next question is from george shapiro with shapiro research please go ahead george shapiro good morning can you hear me marillyn hewson barely george try again george shapiro  shapiro research on the f the incremental margin was  so did you increase the margin on the lrip  or  or both and then also the deliveries were flat with last year and down from q so i would think that wed be starting to see increases here given the deliveries are going to be higher so whats happening there thanks bruce tanner yes george i’ll try those so incremental margins i didnt do the calculation that you just cited but youre probably right your math is always good george and we did have a couple of pickups i think we actually  you asked which specific lrip we had some risk retirements or step ups and we actually had i want to say three separate lrips and you should think of these as somewhat older lrip contracts or lrip numbers i believe two of the three were five  lrips five and seven so this is sort of reflecting the fact that were closing out or getting ready to sort of close out some of those lots the ones you talked about the more current ones lot  and so forth and lot  were getting good performance on those but thats probably step ups that we look forward to in the coming years as  coming quarters as opposed to this quarter here and then as far as deliveries george now the way i look at that i think theres  i think were planning  aircraft to be delivered for the year and what may not be clear in that number is there’s only  the biggest lions share of that  of those are being delivered out of fort worth the other five are going to be delivered out of the international locations that marillyn talked the faco in nagoya japan and the other faco in italy so none of those five aircraft have yet to deliver although they’ve rolled out as marillyn said so all those are out in front of us and as you look at where we ended the first half of the year wed actually delivered  aircraft that number is a little deceptive because we closed the quarter actually on june  as opposed to the end of the month and we actually had some deliveries between then and the end of the month as we sit here today george i want to say we’ve delivered  aircraft so far and i think were on track to deliver  by the end of this month so were actually progressing essentially right on track on the domestic deliveries and we do expect those five international deliveries to all take place in the second half so short set i think were tracking to our expectations relative to  aircraft for the year operator our next questions from pete skibitski with drexel hamilton please go ahead pete skibitski good morning guys i had a further f and aeronautics margin question just because bruce it seems like the f has been kind of less of a headwind maybe than you expected going into this year and i know some of its on better performance at the international facilities and whatnot but as you look out into  it will be a bigger part of the mix f and aeronautics do you have any confidence probably yet to say that this year is kind of the trough for aeronautics margin and well start to expand as we go out on higher f or is there still some uncertainty in some of the latest lrip lots bruce tanner just to be clear pete you’re talking about a trough for aeronautics or a trough for f you were talking about aeronautics i presume right pete skibitski  drexel hamilton correct correct bruce tanner you know what im not sure i want to call that in this quarter pete i’ll feel a whole lot better we do our planning between now and the third quarter and when we give you the trend information in  i will surely address that then but i dont think your question is that far off the mark if the answer is not yes thats probably where wed expect the trough the answer is it’s probably pretty close to that maybe ’ but well take a look at that when we give you the trend information in october pete skibitski  drexel hamilton okay fair enough thank you bruce tanner yes and i should say in any event we would still expect there  even if it was a trough i dont see it dropping below  the only question is weve had some to your point some pickups earlier this year is can we match that next year going forward but again i’ll give you a lot more insight in the october call thanks operator next we go to david strauss with ubs please go ahead david strauss thanks good morning thanks for taking my question bruce i guess first a clarification the  to  revenue growth and talking about maybe being at the lower end of that in  does that include the change in revenue recognition thats the clarification and then thinking about cash conversion free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years youve obviously got pension cash moving down but then as we look out towards the end of the decade you have  your fas expense is going to come down could you just talk about the progression of how youre seeing free cash flow conversion over the next maybe  towards the end of the decade thanks bruce tanner david im actually glad you asked that clarification on the  to  were sort of based on current revrec methodology although weve give more information on this when we have the results when we give the trend information in october but at the least preliminarily indiscernible pulling together in anticipation of that revrec changing were kind of i’ll say running revrec in addition to the normal methodology for the first quarter and second quarter i havent seen the second quarter results yet but so far everything is indicating that you would think we should see a whole lot of difference and part of the reason for that is a lot of the units of delivery are what we call pot passage on title transfer where we essentially record sales upon delivery as long as youre sort of delivering at a constant rate and the program is not at the end of its life if you will then you wouldn’t expect to see a large swing even when you’ve converted over to a percentage of cost or cost to cost methodology and thats sort of our expectation we dont see a large drop off or a large increase or decrease in our pot deliveries there so most importantly on our revrec f is not  does not change one bit and thats obviously the biggest driver of aeronautics and for that matter sales for the corporation so im hopeful having said that dave that the  to  sort of works under either methodology the current methodology or the new revrec methodology is what im trying to say and we’ll see what that looks like when we provide the trend information in ’ as i keep saying relative to the free cash flow conversion we teed this up in the past david you and i have had a couple of conversations on this we  i think the  we talked about fas income you sort of brought that up in   the  timeframe is the end of the accruals relative to our pension trust going forward so essentially the trust becomes completely frozen at that point in time and because you lose the service cost we actually end up getting fas income in that point in time as far as cash is concerned we will expect to see cash contribution the erisa contributions continue to increase through that period of time but we would also expect to see cas recoveries in our price that are government contracts increase by about a similar amount so we still expect to have a tailwind associated with pension cash and free cash flow literally going out i think it’s still consistent what we showed maybe as much as a year ago that all the way out through  at least as we sit here today we expect to have some tailwind from pension dynamics relative to our cash flow going forward and thats still what we see today operator our next question is from cai von rumohr with cowen  company please go ahead cai von rumohr yes thank you very much so since your first quarter it looks like your foreign sales prospects have improved can you update us in terms of what youre looking for for book to bill this year and any color on next year and secondly you mentioned a lot of the foreign potentials you didnt mention some of the nato missile defense potentials such as romania sweden for the patriot system and meads thank you very much bruce tanner cai i’ll take a stab at that and marillyn can add some color to it if she wants to so relative to the first question and how were doing were actually tracking hopefully better or better than planned relative to international orders today i dont have necessarily the book to bill for the year but i mean trying to do this math in my head i think were slightly ahead of book to bill as we sit here today meaning international order are higher than international sales to date i would expect that to be the case at the end of the year a lot of that obviously is predicated on whether or not we get sort of the first tranche of the ksa the kingdom of saudi arabia orders that marillyn talked about those  billion worth of orders theres the potential that some of those can come in between now and the end of the year its not obviously clear that they will there’s obviously some congressional notifications and the like that has to take place and getting the funding employees to do that but there is that possibility now even without that i still think well probably be probably in a positive situation book to bill because we wont have the sales for that either for international business there so having said that as we look out in the future and you didn’t ask this question cai but we still think weve got a chance to end the year potentially at around  billion of backlog if some of these especially the kingdom of saudi arabia orders come in this year as opposed to next year but even without that  to  is probably what were expecting and again more on the international side than the sales for the year so a positive book to bill you asked about the air missile defense were still in conversations with germany right now the meads opportunity there theres a stated objective to get that negotiation complete by the end of this year well see if that actually closes then but if not then i would hope that that closes at least in the early part of  and obviously theres poland with the patriot sale and well do a lot of the pac  all the pac missile associated with that sale you mentioned some other nato countries i’ll let marillyn maybe jump in and give you a little more insight than i can provide to you marillyn hewson sure you mentioned poland rumania and others i mean of course we have aegis ashore which is us system that’s been placed in europe but thats an opportunity missile defenses theres a strong demand in europe as well as in other parts of the world asia pacific and the middle east where we continue to see opportunities jassm was an opportunity from the standpoint of poland and so there  youre exactly right there continues to be in the nato environment missile defense opportunities for us to continue to meet as well as for other parts of the world and i think as we have recently done the thaad test out of alaska that was a very successful test in fact  out of  on thaad one that im sure that many countries will take a look at at the successful capability of that to take out a ballistic missile and so that being an opportunity that weve talked about that currently in south korea protecting that area in guam but certainly japan and other countries will continue to look at thaad as a capability in the european market as well operator our next question is from myles walton with deutsche bank please go ahead myles walton thanks good morning on space you raised the sales guidance there and just curious on your outlook for space in general going here in  where the uptick was coming from and then if ’ this gives you any indication that its actually got some growth in it and then conversely the incremental margins looked a little light  incremental margins is that just to absorb the commercial satellite charges or something else thanks bruce tanner i’ll try those myles so we’re pleased with where space is heading this year in terms of sales it’s  as i said in the prepared remarks its a little higher than our expectations and obviously we increased the guidance for the year it’s a little higher than what we expected when we started the year i do think that portends well for  growth and theres some of that coming from our special programs business and there are some opportunities there that we have to see how they play out that will drive that either higher or not as high depending on the outcome of those opportunities and then relative to the incremental margin you have that right myles and that is reflective of the fact that some of that volume was offset by the commercial satellite charge that we did take in the quarter and thats probably worth talking maybe a little bit about only because it  that sounds like a bad item to have a charge on the commercial satellite but this is really taking our old legacy a satellite bus which weve had for a number of decades and really providing a technology refresh of that legacy satellite so its sort of updating it to the current state of the art we’re putting a whole lot of new technologies and capabilities into it everything from power capabilities and increases to the propulsion on the satellite the electronics weve got a new solar array new power regulator so a lot of different items all being sort of put together and unfortunately the satellite where this happened to be the first article for production was the largest commercial satellite we ever built or will have ever built and so  well thats the bad news the good news is is this new configuration satellite has already resulted in new orders from the us government and i look at it as this is something that we had to do we had to refresh that product line and while id prefer it not to be on a fixed price commercial international contract i have to sort of cut your teeth on were glad that were doing this now because this will position us to have a foundation for new satellite offerings hopefully for years to come operator next we go to with stifel please go ahead joe denardi thanks very much bruce wondering if you could just talk about capital deployment from a leverage standpoint are you comfortable with where you are now and we should just assume that all of the free cash flow gets split up between the buyback and dividend or do you see some deleveraging over the next year or two bruce tanner yes so good question joe that’s something we’re  we obviously talk every september with our board relative to future deployment actions relative to dividends but before that session before we have those discussions and we discuss that sort of strategic view with our board of directors i’ll say the expectation is its sort of more the same in terms of our deployment actions we do have some near term debt retirements coming up starting in  we’ll come  thats something that we’ll guide you towards relative to the trend information ’ as far as our thinking relative to refinancing that or paying that off but our expectation is we probably do some deleveraging as i sit here today going forward in the near term those arent huge chunks of debt but some of these frankly are the very short term financing that we did actually to finance the sikorsky transaction operator next we’ll go to peter arment with baird please go ahead peter arment good morning marillyn and bruce bruce just sticking on sikorsky which you just mentioned  total military helicopter deliveries were down about  year to date how are you thinking about that for the balance of the year and then in the context of obviously the new multiyear with the us army and saudi how should we think about the government deliveries going forward bruce tanner yes so this question peter thats actually something i looked at as i was prepping for the call also the first half deliveries of black hawks are down and at least as i post that with our team at rms that really is just because of the timing of the contract deliveries in the current multiyear eight black hawk order profile even though were down as you pointed out relative to last year the expectation is that we still expect to actually deliver more black hawks this year than we did last year just not a huge number just a handful there but we would expect to catch up and actually have sort of sequential growth in black hawk deliveries with fourth quarter obviously being the highest by quite a bit relative to the first quarter a little bit of a different pattern than what we saw in  but that is the contractual pattern and i didnt look close enough to see if thats because of the types of aircraft we have we have some medevac helos versus utility helicopters and that might be part of it as well but all sort of expected and that is the plan going forward again to sort of finish the year higher than we did this year you also asked about  there was another part of your question peter i think you asked about  relative to the multiyear nine the multiyear nine i think in  and i havent got my head exactly around the deliveries next year but i think theyre fairly complement  maybe a little less than this year but not hugely less alternatively as we look forward the biggest  bigger drop off frankly is in the romeo helicopters these are the naval hawk helicopters if you will thats sort of coming to a much lower number of production aircraft delivery like maybe by a third or so or more reduction next year so one thing that were watching to see if we can get some rebound on that is from the kingdom of saudi arabia one of the items that was in that actually two of the items that was in that  billion that marillyn referenced before was for additional black hawks on top of whats in the multiyear nine black hawk deal today and an additional  or additional romeos are the naval hawk helicopters as well so those have got to sort out and again the timing event peter is what were watching very very closely to see whether or not those orders come in this year the early part of next year but were hopeful they can sort of butt up against the multiyear nine deliveries were talking about greg gardner john this is greg i think we have time for one more question operator and that will be from jason gursky with citi please go ahead jason gursky good morning i wanted to  marillyn i want to ask you about the companys supply chain your strategy there youve spoken in the past about the need for lockheed and its suppliers to focus on two things affordability and cybersecurity essentially to ensure continuity can you provide us a bit of an update on the companys effort to drive affordability out of the supply chain and is your strategy continuing to evolve there are you looking to maybe vertically integrate a little bit more than where youve been in the past and as you look out at things how far along do you think you are in accomplishing your near to medium term goals on affordability and then on the cybersecurity front how do you view the health of the industry overall at this point and whats lockheed and the rest of the industry currently doing to improve the cybersecurity health of the supply chain thanks marillyn hewson thanks jason those are great questions if you look at our supply chain it represents  sometimes  of the revenue on many of our programs it’s a very important element of our business in terms of our execution on programs performance on programs as well as what were able to financially accomplish with those programs so thats great question on the affordability front i would just start with our largest program which is the f and representing last year about  of our sales we put a lot of effort into that piece of it and collectively with our team mates major team mates with northrop grumman and bae systems we worked together on something we call  that the government calls a blueprint for affordability where we actually put funding upfront working not just with the three team mates lockheed martin bae and northrop grumman but all the way through our supply chain and identifying areas where we can invest continue to drive cost down on the f beyond what you would normally get through a ramp up of production and the volume and well continue to do that we’re also doing that on the sustainment side so look at where are there cost reduction initiatives that we can put in place there that would continue to drive the cost down but we are  we work with supply chain affordability every day on all of our programs i feel really good about our affordability initiatives in that regard our teams that work directly with our subcontractors with our suppliers that is one of their primary efforts and ones that working alongside them they’re constantly focused on the other thing i would say is where we have a big opportunity on f is through the block buy because thats where we can get the volume reduction that’s where we can get suppliers if they know theyre going to get three lots worth of work  airplanes and plus then they can invest in driving the cost down they can commit to a lower price to us on their element of the system but bottom line is we work all the way across our supply chain on ongoing basis and are constantly driving in terms of vertical integration i think it really just is driven on a case by case basis where it makes sense i mean if were assuming that we think we have the capability inside lockheed martin that we could do at less cost and more  and better technology then we might look at some vertical integration there or through an acquisition that gives us the opportunity to do that but generally speaking were mainly focused on the affordability and the performance of our supply chain on an ongoing basis you asked a question about cybersecurity and sort of the health of the industry and what are we doing on that front i will just speak from a lockheed martin standpoint we recognize that the supply chain is  its critically important that they have in place appropriate cyber defenses in their business and so we have worked with the department of commerce and the national institute of standards to help put in place voluntary initiatives that  and frameworks that work with supply chain on how they can get employees the appropriate defenses we then audit and monitor what our supply chain our suppliers have in the way of cybersecurity defenses on an ongoing basis and we actually work with our customer our customer often looks to us for the depth and capability we have in cybersecurity it is a line of business for us we do it for many customers and supporting them and we likewise take that same capability and try to work it back through the supply chain as well in terms of health of the industry i think its an ongoing effort that weve got to constantly stay focused on as a nation the threats are constantly changing or theres always an unpredictability in that sense but weve been a thought leader and an industry leader in cybersecurity for many years in fact we have the national cyber range where we develop that and where our government customers and others can bring their solutions and test them on those national cyber range and determine whether it brings the kind of defenses that were looking for that they expect and so i would say across the board cyber has been an area for us that as in everything that we do across the system it runs through all of our programs it is  we have a robust capability that we provide to customers and we work hard with our supply chain to make sure that they get the right defenses in their own networks on ongoing basis thank you so i think that that was the last question greg let me just wrap back and conclude the call today i want to conclude by restating that our second quarter results and our increased  outlook reflect that we have an ongoing commitment to our strategy for growth strong cash generation and we continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers and long term value creation for our stockholders we’re very pleased with the solid results that we had for the quarter i want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call in october so john that
