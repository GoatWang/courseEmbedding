jessica s carey of counsel for respondents order supreme court new york county jeffrey k oing j entered january   which to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs granted defendants motion to dismiss the fraud claims and order same court and justice entered march   which to the extent appealed from denied plaintiffs motion for leave to file an amended complaint unanimously affirmed this case is yet another action arising from the worldwide financial crisis that began in  plaintiff aozora bank ltd is a japanese commercial bank with its principal offices in tokyofn aozora invested in complex financial products backed by mortgages including collateralized debt obligations cdosfn in december  aozora invested in a cdo called blue edge a  billion cdo that included residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs defendants deutsche bank securities inc and deutsche bank ag together deutsche bank or defendants structured and sold the cdo aozora bought  million of the cdos class a tranche aozora alleges that although deutsche bank selected the rmbs that were to be included in the cdo deutsche bank actually held negative views about those securities for example aozora alleges deutsche banks global head of cdos greg lippmann made numerous disparaging comments internally about the rmbs included in blue edge referring to them as among other things weak and horrible similarly defendants internal emails allegedly show that lippman and other deutsche bank insiders knew and were sometimes pressured not to disclose their negative views on rmbs in order to promote client interest in defendants cdo products the underlying assets included in blue edge were subject to deutsche banks approval and deutsche bank generally approved thirdparty collateral manager selections for deutsche bankarranged cdos even where they included the very same rmbs that defendants internally disparaged beginning in late  deutsche bank began accumulating a short position with respect to subprime rmbs in blue edge and urged some of its noncdo investor clients to do the same according to aozora deutsche bank sold credit default swap protection on rmbs to their hedge fund clients so as to hedge those clients exposure to the underperforming rmbs while shifting the long position—in this case the riskier position—to deutsche bankarranged cdos such as blue edge in connection with marketing selling and offering blue edge to investors deutsche bank created drafted and disseminated various marketing and offering documents these documents allegedly contained material misrepresentations misleading statements and omissions specifically aozora alleges the marketing and offering documents did not disclose defendants negative views of blue edges underlying rmbs assets the marketing and offering documents also indicated that deutsche bank would hold blue edges collateral portfolio on its own books until closing of the cdo thereby ensuring deutsche banks selection of topquality collateral however deutsche bank was allegedly engaged in decreasing its own rmbs exposure at the same time it was encouraging clients to invest in cdos further the marketing and offering documents indicate that at least  of blue edges collateral portfolio would be prime rmbs that is lower risk and less than  would consist of subprime rmbs that is higher risk however aozora alleges that blue edges asset pool was far riskier than deutsche bank represented and that only  of the collateral assets were prime rmbs while  of the portfolio consisted of riskier subprime midprime and alta rmbs aozora filed a summons with notice on june   in its complaint filed january   aozora asserted causes of action for common law fraud aiding and abetting fraud breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment with respect to the claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation aozora asserted that it reasonably relied on deutsche banks misrepresentations and omissions specifically aozora alleged it conducted its own due diligence and risk analysis scrutinizing among other things blue edges collateral portfolio and its structural protections against collateral losses aozora stated that it also reviewed the marketing materials and concluded that the investment as represented by deutsche bank was appropriate however aozora insisted it did not know and could not have known that the marketing materials and offering documents contained material misrepresentations and omissions that blue edges portfolio was filled with rmbs that defendants internally disparaged or that deutsche bank had understated the degree to which blue edge was collateralized by higherrisk lowerquality assets aozora alleged that absent deutsche banks misconduct it never would have made its investment in blue edge and that deutsche banks misconduct caused aozora to suffer a  principal loss on its investment deutsche bank moved to dismiss the complaint under cplr  a  and  on the motion deutsche bank argued among other things that all of aozoras claims were timebarred because aozora filed its action more than six years after it bought blue edge and more than two years after it should have discovered the alleged fraud in the exercise of reasonable diligence to support this argument deutsche bank attached details of numerous publications testimony and lawsuits regarding the financial crisis the earliest of this material was dated from march —nearly seven years before aozora commenced this action in january  indeed deutsche bank noted beginning in early  it was well publicized that banks including deutsche bank were under investigation for their involvement in creating defective mortgage products deutsche bank also attached excerpts from an april   report of the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the united states senate entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse senate report finally deutsche bank attached proof that moodys had downgraded blue edge to junk status in june  all this information deutsche bank asserted put aozora on notice of its claims years before it commenced this action in opposition to the motion to dismiss aozora submitted the affidavit of the general manager of its international division in tokyo justin hirsch hirsch affidavit in his affidavit hirsch noted that his averments were not based on his personal knowledge but on his review of aozoras files and records hirsch stated that aozora did not arrange originate or structure any cdos but rather invested in cdos in the united states moreover hirsch noted plaintiffs office in new york was small with never more than four employees during the relevant period the new york office primarily facilitated client services in the united states its employees were not structured finance professionals and were not involved in plaintiffs decision to invest in structured finance products according to hirsch when aozora began to experience cdo losses it believed those losses were the result of the united states subprime mortgage crisis however in september  a former employee of aozora contacted the bank stating that several other banks had recently brought successful claims against structured finance arrangers and inquiring whether aozora wanted its portfolio reviewed to determine whether it might have viable claims thereafter hirsch stated as part of aozoras due diligence efforts in november and december  it spoke with several united statesbased law firms regarding its potential claims in march  aozora retained its current counsel after reviewing aozoras investments counsel informed aozora that deutsche bank had been discussed in the april  senate report while the senate report did not mention the blue edge cdo by name hirsch asserted that aozoras counsel analyzed the blue edge cdos asset portfolio discovering that certain of the rmbs that were contained in the blue edge cdo portfolio were mentioned in the senate report according to hirsch it was then that aozora realized that it might have actionable claims against defendants and commenced this action the ias court found that aozoras fraud claims were untimely under the twoyear discovery rule in so doing the court concluded that aozora was on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud by no later than april  when the senate report was released indeed the court noted the senate investigation of the financial crisis began in april  further the court found aozora failed to raise an issue of fact as to whether it had exercised reasonable diligence in an effort to discover its fraud claims in that regard the court noted that the information publicly available by  should have alerted aozora that something was amiss with its investment thus the court concluded aozora should have begun an investigation well before it actually did the court also specifically noted that the hirsch affidavit failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether given the circumstances surrounding the investment and the financial crisis aozora had engaged in reasonable diligencefn the parties do not dispute that plaintiffs fraud causes of action were not timely under new yorks sixyear limitations period and to be timely must have been commenced within two years from the time plaintiff discovered the fraud or with reasonable diligence could have discovered it cplr   as this court has held where the circumstances are such as to suggest to a person of ordinary intelligence the probability that he has been defrauded a duty of inquiry arises and if he omits that inquiry when it would have developed the truth and shuts his eyes to the facts which call for investigation knowledge of the fraud will be imputed to him cifg assur n am inc v credit suisse sec usa llc  add   st dept  see also gutkin v siegal  add   st dept  the test as to when fraud should with reasonable diligence have been discovered is an objective one thus public reports and lawsuits of alleged fraud are sufficient to put a plaintiff on inquiry notice of fraud see cifg assur n am  add at  aldrich v marsh  mclennan cos inc  add   st dept  lv denied  nyd   similarly losses that a plaintiff sustains may put it on notice of possible fraud see ghandour v shearson lehman bros  add   st dept  lv denied  nyd   accordingly deutsche bank made a prima facie case that aozora was on inquiry notice of its fraud claims before june   that is two years before it filed the summons with notice the burden then shifted to aozora to establish that even if it had exercised reasonable diligence it could not have discovered the basis for its claims before that date but aozora failed to carry its burden as there was a wealth of public information that should have put it on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud first in  blue edge was downgraded to junk status and plaintiff incurred substantial losses on its investment second there was considerable publicity about the subprime mortgage crisis from news reports investor lawsuits and government investigations well before june  indeed by april  defendants had been sued multiple times in connection with rmbs and cdos including in connection with a deutsche bank cdo known as gemstone which plaintiff discusses in its complaint as involving wrongdoing by defendants identical to that involved with respect to blue edge see ghandour  add at   the plaintiff was on notice where his brother made the same investments and commenced a timely fraud action six years earlier third one of the most significant sources of public information putting plaintiff on notice of its fraud claims is the senate report and its associated emails which actually form the centerpiece of plaintiffs complaint in fact the senate report contains a page section on deutsche bank entitled running the cdo machine case study of deutsche bank taken with all the other information available in the public domain the senate report is more than sufficient to have placed aozora on inquiry notice of possible fraud by april  at the latest see aldrich  add at  cf csam capital inc v lauder  add  st dept  that blue edge was not mentioned by name in the senate report does not change this result aozora had more than  million invested in blue edge and other cdos it could have and should have considered whether blue edges underlying assets fell within the senate reports ambit also significant is that aozoras counsel actually did investigate aozoras potential claims in  or  however aozora provides no explanation for why it could not have performed that same investigation before june   when losses from the subprime mortgage crisis were receiving considerable attention in the press see cifg assur n am  add at  the proposed amended complaint does not cure the statute of limitations defects in the original complaint as it does not gainsay that aozora was on inquiry notice of alleged fraud more than two years before it filed the summons with notice see kbay plaza llc v kmart corp  add   st dept  meimeteas v carter ledyard  milburn llp  add  st dept  concur—acosta jp renwick andrias and moskowitz jj footnotes footnote the facts are taken from the complaint which must be accepted as true for the purposes of the cplr  motion footnote according to statements by aozoras counsel at oral argument azora had a total of  million in cdo investments by the end of  footnote on february   aozora moved to reargue the ias courts dismissal of its fraud claims or for leave to file an amended complaint on march   the ias court denied that motion microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser

fudosan bank under a special government trust banking license alongside the longterm credit bank of japan ltcb nippon fudosan bank was itself based on the remaining assets of the bank of joseon in japan in december  ncb was brought under government control in order to deal with its extraordinary amount of bad debt left over from the crash of the japanese asset price bubble in the early s at the time the bank was approximately ¥ billion in debt an investor group led by softbank orix and tokio marine  fire insurance co purchased ncb in  for ¥ billion as part of this deal the government included a defect warranty provision  kashi tanpo jōkō to the effect that ncb could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from value a similar provision had controversially been offered to the purchasers of ltcb which had recently been similarly purchased from the government and renamed shinsei bank aozora applied this provision conservatively in order to write off ¥ billion in bad debts owed by about  companies in contrast to shinsei bank the contemporaneous successor of the longterm credit bank which wrote off nearly three times as much and was criticized in political circles for doing so the sale of ncb to softbank was viewed as a precedent for the licensing of sony bank seven bank and other new
