original article on the main bradley site here april   looking back on nearly four decades in the business world bradley alum howard lance ’ noted the importance of mentors versatility and an openminded approach to opportunities lance an executive advisor at the blackstone group and retired harris corporation ceo spoke to bradley students in late march an undergraduate coop experience at caterpillar set lance on an engineering path but early career opportunities to work with customers opened new possibilities “it was like a light switch went off so i decided to give it a shot” he said “i had no background in business so i had no business doing it but i was lucky i had mentors” that led to a shift to the business management side that defined the rest of his career “i never thought i would be a ceo or aspire to be a ceo until my late s” lance said “if you take care of the job you have the next job will take care of itself” with technology ubiquitous in both business and engineering he recognized the need for the modern workforce to be versatile in both fields thus convergence efforts like those on the hilltop are needed “the notion of convergence which bradley is leading in is the forefront of what’s going on in business” lance said “in the end for a commercial enterprise it’s not just about creating things but creating things people will buy” “the sooner you can get these capabilities the better you’ll be and bradley is on the cutting edge” he added “it’s the right thing at the right time” in addition to crossdisciplinary knowledge lance encouraged students to be lifelong learners who can adapt to an everevolving world “markets can change overnight many organizations  years ago who would’ve been market leaders are now market laggers what you’ve got here is important but do you have the skills to go forward” he said “the days of being able to come out of college start your career and go into the cubicle are gone we need people who can go into bigger cubicles and work with four six eight people and solve problems” in addition to a diverse skill set lance suggested students seek wise counsel mentors he said were crucial to his success “what i am is a compilation of all these great people who taught and allowed me to do things” he said “i could not achieve what i have in life without them i’m a product of their good guidance” lance’s wisdom resonated with mechanical engineering majors adam smetters ’ and andrew davis ’ “convergence is important for engineering because it teaches us how to think differently” smetters said “as a senior close to graduating a lot of things he said are what i’m considering” said davis noting points lance made about prioritizing time and details caterpillar college of engineering and technology
