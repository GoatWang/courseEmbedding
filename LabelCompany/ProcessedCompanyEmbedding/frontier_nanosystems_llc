the inherent constraints convention imposes upon modern system architectures circuit designs and systems of production in recent years the word disruptive has been so misapplied it is now almost meaningless  if you lived through the emergence of the space age you witnessed how advances in the materials sciences fundamentally shifted economic paradigms from the popularized “plastics plastics plastics” mantra to handheld transistor radios the quality of our lives improved and the economic revitalization led to new wealth potentials history clearly shows that new and improved materials are always at the forefront of industrial progress and economic prosperity  from the bessemer process for steel production which led to the expansion of many worldwide industries to reverse osmosis polymer membranes used for water purification higher quality materials have fundamentally improved productive industry and the human condition vacuum tubes originally invented in the ’s were not commercialized until the ’s when advanced materials manufacturing technologies enabled them to be distributed at a profit  this materials innovation birthed the dawn of the electronics era the beginning of global communications and the awakening of the human community the transistor first invented in  did not significantly penetrate commercial markets until advances in materials science in the late ’s and early ’s allowed  transistors to be integrated onto a single chip  this innovation delivered the economic viability needed to commercially displace vacuum tubes from virtually all consumer products and birthed the panoply of devices that enrich our lives today our big nano solutions satisfy technical and economic criteria needed to displace the economically exhausted microelectronic system assemblies built using  yearold printed circuit board technologies   by eliminating compositional and grain size variations in our laminated electroceramics high performance big nano microstructures satisfy “critical performance tolerances” needed to achieve the last step of microelectronic integration  see image above right  big nano electroceramics enable passive components resistors inductors and capacitors having performance varying less than the ± from their design values over all standard operating temperatures to be integrated onto semiconductors without damaging transistors embedded beneath their surface frontier nanosystems is using this core competence to develop novel power management designs that improve the efficiency of our power grid and fundamentally change computing and radio architectures our patented power management systems will ultimately allow the capacity of a contemporary computer workstation to be held in the palm of a hand and be

frontiers meet the team news ip estate contact we make nano big frontier nanosystems has established a global patent position on a new phase of matter  we call it big nano nanotechnologies have not realized their full market potentials because the exotic properties of a nanoparticle are only observable in materials having physical size imperceptible to the human senses  this size constraint places nanotechnology beyond practical utility in many commercial applications to hold meaningful economic value materials need to be big enough to be easily manipulated and integrated into higher value products  unfortunately a nanoparticle’s exotic properties are diminished or lost when it is sintered within a collection of trillions upon trillions of nanoparticles into a material body large enough to be commercially useful  herein lies the fundamental paradox where nanotechnology’s promises have failed commercial and roi expectations frontier nanosystems’ patented manufacturing solutions unleash nanotechnology’s full potential by forming physically large material bodies having nanoscale grains  nm in diameter and compositional precision  our globally patented microstructure shown below is what we call big nano  it is a material large enough to hold great economic value yet one that simultaneously possesses the exotic physical properties of its less useful nanoparticle equivalent we form these materials as laminates integrated into a higher value product or as freestanding bodies with atomic scale chemical uniformity regardless of the material’s compositional complexity our low processing temperatures enable our proprietary big nano electroceramics to be integrated onto the surface of semiconductor chips without affecting embedded transistors—an innovative breakthrough that enables high efficiency power management systems to drive the next generation of microelectronic integration and system design  our principal waste products are water and carbon
