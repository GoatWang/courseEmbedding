previous postdetail therapy next postthe suite life five of the top hotels in beverly hills are celebrating the citys centennial year in style photography cliff lipsontwentyeight years ago arnold kopelson won the best picture academy award for his american war drama platoon he remembers the moment like it was yesterday“next to the birth of my children it’s the greatest achievement i’ve ever had” kopelson says “there’s no high like an academy award”kopelson now  can vividly recall everything about the date of march   he remembers that dustin hoffman nearly announced the best picture winner without naming the nominees that he was wiping wife anne’s lipstick off his mouth in front of  million viewers and that his best laid plans went awry despite rehearsing his speech in front of a video camera and writing careful “crib notes” he was so overcome by the win that he briefly lost the power of speech“i got through the first two sentences before my mouth dried up to such an extent that i could barely open my jaw the nerves had gotten to me” the producer admits “i had a momentary loss of speech i looked down at the cards in my hand and they were all out of order i can’t tell you what the panic was like”but kopelson of course pulled it together and walked offstage to thunderous applause after giving what he proudly reaffirms was a “great speech” this is the moment that made arnold kopelson the gave him the career he has today it is why “everyone in this town – everybody — takes my call” because he never intended to have a career in the entertainment industry – never mind such a successful one – the enormity of his achievement is staggeringkopelson started his career in the commercial world as a lawyer for motion pictures and banking which eventually brought him into production it wasn’t until he was practicing at a firm that represented several banks that were making loans to film companies that kopelson started learning the language of entertainment so to speak he began traveling around the world with an independent movie financier and realized there was a specific niche he could fill in the international market for film financingwhat he found was a western called the last rebel starring legendary nfl star joe namath “he was not an actor” kopelson admits “i didn’t realize how bad the movie was but it sold all over the world i made more money in my press book with that one film than in any year of being a lawyer everyone wanted that movie”arnold with joel schumacher and michael douglas on the set of falling downarnold with michael douglas on the set of falling downthe popularity of the film set kopelson on his path of success licensing the movies of others “i set up deals i’d get a completion guarantee and then i’d start the movie with a profit that lasted until movies started to get very expensive and it brought me into larger productions but by that time platoon had happened”he recalls the moment he first read platoon’s script which was written by the thenvirtually unknown oliver stone “i was overcome” he recalls “i called oliver when i had read  pages and he said ‘not so fast finish the script’ so i got into bed with anne and i started reading i got goose flesh i pictured myself as the star walking through the jungle and never knowing when i was going to get a bullet in the head i was totally captivated by the writing i had an actual fantasy of winning an academy award while i was reading it i thought it was the greatest writing i had ever seen“when i finished i had tears streaming down my face anne asked what was wrong and i told her i was incredibly moved she asked ‘will it make money’ i said ‘i really don’t know but it’s just real quality and i have to make it she told me to follow my instincts so i met with stone and we made a partnership to do the film”few realize that the making of platoon almost didn’t happen with stone as a director but that kopelson figured out a way to save the day “oliver was just great but orion the film company that produced platoon didn’t know if he could direct they thought he couldn’t do it he was working on a film called salvador and orion wanted him to make cuts because they thought it was too violent and he was refusing so i put my legal hat on and found out what specific cuts they wanted to make i said ‘if he makes these cuts will you wholly or partially finance platoon’ they said yes so i prepared the contract specifying the cuts and then met with oliver and said ‘this is your chance to make the movie of your dreams’”the rest as they say is history forging a relationship between the two men that has lasted for nearly  years “i saw oliver a few weeks ago we’ve maintained a relationship” kopelson says now adding “i have great feelings for him for making platoon it was his dream his story and an extraordinary movie i’m grateful to him it got me an oscar early on in my career” that career is one of success his  movies to date such as seen a perfect murder and eraser have earned over  billion globally and have been responsible for one academy award and an additional  nominations and it just keeps on going kopelson currently has a plethora of projects in development“i’m busier now that i have been in years” the producer admits he is working on several films as well as two television series which is a natural evolution considering that he’s sat on the board of directors at cbs for nearly seven years “we just closed a deal to do a television series based on my movie devil’s advocate with john wells productions and i’m also acting as a consultant on a series based on my movie outbreak and an untitled series about going to mars it’s a realitybased fictional story” he sayshe is working on four films including a picture that oscar winner william friedkin will direct as well as a film about george gershwin and another based on the life of dennis hopper the latter is currently being written and has been approved by the late actor’s family he is working closely with the icon’s daughter on the projectthe film kopelson is most enthusiastic about is his remake of alfred hitchcock’s  thriller strangers on a train which he’s developing for warner bros he reveals that the modernday version is eversoslightly tweaked from the original the plot revolves around two strangers – a tennis player and a psychopath – who meet on a train the psychopath suggests that because each of the characters wants to “get rid” of someone they should swap murders and thus neither will get caughtdavid seltzer the writer of bird on a wire and the omen has changed the tennis player character of guy to a businessman with the same name who is about to be named chairman of a highly profitable company the psychopath bruno will remain the same “i want to get a major player for the bruno role” kopelson says “we’re in the process of going after that now”though he’s certainly going to have a hand in the casting process kopelson notes that he won’t have complete control which is quite unlike what he was used to at the beginning of his career “hollywood is very different now” he acknowledges “on every one of my movies i would cast every role i would cast the major parts the studio would approve it and then i would work with a casting agent for all of the minor roles for that i wouldn’t have to get studio approval today if you can get a movie made at all you’re lucky”despite his success kopelson is also familiar with rejection “every movie i’ve ever made has been rejected somewhere and i’m talking about the blockbusters” he admits “you have to have passion persistence and determination those are the three qualities that one must possess to be a successful producer and to make great movies and i do persist i don’t care if i’ve been turned down five times…i like to win” previous post next post detail therapythe suite life five of the top hotels in beverly hills are celebrating the citys centennial year in styleconnect with

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
