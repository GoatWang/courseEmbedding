search menu close biosimilar indication extrapolation although the fda may approve a biosimilar for all of the indications of its reference product the biosimilar’s manufacturer may have only conducted clinical trials for one or two representative indications extrapolation is an important concept for biosimilars hear dr gregory schimizzi clarify this concept to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html video key takeaways indication extrapolation refers to a biosimilar being approved for indications that were not evaluated during the biosimilar’s clinical trials given the complexities of the science behind extrapolation based on scientific justification it may not be appropriate in all cases the fda recommends that a biosimilar manufacturer choose a condition of use that would be adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and reference product in some cases healthy volunteers may be the most sensitive population to study when seeking to reveal differences in immune responses as healthy volunteers are not immunocompromised and therefore will exhibit normal immune responses next the biosimilars label about this expert gregory f schimizzi md rheumatologist cofounder of carolina arthritis associates pa wilmington nc biosimilars vs generics medical oncologist dr

vs generics share this page search menu close biosimilars vs generics biosimilars are often confused with generic drugs—but they are not the same dr michael morse explains the fundamental differences one significant distinction unlike generics the fda requires a biosimilar to be highly similar but not identical to the existing biologic medicine which is referred to as a reference product biologic medicines are large complex molecules or mixtures of molecules that may be composed of living material as such biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference products to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html video key takeaways biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference products unlike generic drugs which are chemically synthesized biosimilars are grown in complex living systems given the complexity of this process its unlikely for biosimilars to be exact replicas biosimilars may be marked with an interchangeability designation which means it meets additional standards and can be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist per state laws without the intervention of the original prescriber biosimilars are reviewed under the abbreviated fda review process known as k pathway the sponsor of a biosimilar demonstrates biosimilarity primarily from nonclinical analyses that examine the structure and functional nature of the biosimilar molecule per fda guidance the agency reviews the totality of evidence in a stepwise approach and does not necessarily focus on one type of study to evaluate a sponsor’s application for demonstration of biosimilarity next extrapolation about this expert michael a morse md mhs facp medical oncologist duke university medical center durham

factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
