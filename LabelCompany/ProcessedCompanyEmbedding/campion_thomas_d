transworld business home news features the state of the state of skate the state of surf purchase sections trends profiles what we are reading case study follow grindtvcom zumiez founder tom campion shares insight on building a sales based culture canadian expansion and giving back october   by lewism zumiez founder tom campion love it or hate it zumiez has built a position in the market that commands respect and no one at the company has done as much as cofounder and chairman tom campion to write its playbook of success over its year history campion  opened his first store above the belt in washington in  which developed into the door mallbased action sports retailer zumiez to say that campion—who started working retail in a grocery store in  and later in management for jc penney—has seen it all in the retail game is a vast understatement but while he’s from the old school of valuing personal communications and relationship building over electronic communications zumiez has adapted and stayed ahead of the curve improving store comps every year but one before the recession and is back on track to make that happen again campion says zumiez has achieved success by focusing on a salesbased culture providing meaningful recognition and incentives such as its k sales event and giving back to the sports and community to connect to something larger we caught up with campion at the seattle office of his campion foundation to learn more about the godfather of action sports retail’s strategies for success what were the biggest lessons you learned from working in the grocery business and then with penney’s in the ’s i learned i loved retail but didn’t like the grocery business i went to penney’s loved retail but didn’t like the way they treated their people but i learned a ton—what worked and what didn’t that was pre computer and pre cell phone you had to negotiate and understand how to work and buy i ran different departments and discovered what really worked you pushed down authority and responsibility to your lead staff in the departments rather than some charger coming out telling staff “this is what we’re going to do” i learned to say “what do you want to do what’s going to make it so we can have a comp store sales gain” it worked really well and i took that philosophy on into zumiez starting with a couple employees and me and my partner that started it it isn’t always easy but we’ve grown and perfected it— the team has— over the  years we’ve been in existence what didn’t you like about how penney’s treated their people i always have had a little problem with authority—authority that’s not justified—“you do this because i’m the founder and i’m going to go out and play golf” or some bullshit like that doesn’t that translate into problems throughout business or society if you’re going to have vision and you’re going to lead you got to lead by example not just by words how do you share your vision and strategy as the company grows and evolves you can’t do one thing one year and a new one the next there has to be consistency over time so employees know what’s coming you have to believe it yourself and you have to be honorable about it you’ve got to appreciate the fact that they’re working to make the sale they are the face to your customer all the time what you tell them has to be consistent you said at a past transworld snow conference “the more power i have given away the better this company has become” what does that look like at the store level the manager runs his or her store and has not total autonomy but pretty good autonomy they hire for their store the goal is always to drive the ambition to grow we’re going to grow comp store sales we’re going to add new locations and it’s their responsibility to train staff to grow the machine it’s interesting talking to your staff at least at the k level employees that sold over  in the year they’re all really strong brand evangelists and proud of what they do how do you instill that in them it’s the importance of saying thanks of passing down responsibility and the complexity of what you’re doing a human being’s a human being—they want more than to just stand there ringing things up you don’t want robots you want people that can think and use their talent to build the sale and teach somebody about the products you’ve got to incentivize it so employees have the opportunity to grow the first year i did the k in the late ’s i took six kids out to dinner it was a way to say thanks now it gets emotional a lot of these kids have been to five six seven of these imagine a kid that’s  to  working in the middle of idaho or colorado and he’s putting  grand in the till yearin and yearout they’ll say to me “i use to work for x retailer they never did anything for me i never met the guy in charge and you’re here saying ‘thank you’ wait until you see what i’m going to sell next year” frigging jc penney himself or sam walton couldn’t ask an employee to say more in this competitive work environment to say i’m going to put it on the line i’m going to work my butt off next year because i believe in what we’re doing here it’s exactly what you want it really works culture costs money and k costs a lot of money but it’s core to who we are ceo rick brooks got it from the getgo he was my cfo and embraces that it isn’t just about the financial statement it’s about the longterm vision about how we’re going to grow we announced to the market that we’re heading into canada next year at some level and we think we can do that in other countries certain values consistently applied over a long period of time—you get the playbook down and it just seems to work seems like a great way to focus you’re incentives on your key performers yeah we really believe it i’m  zumiez is  years old and listen to the emotion in my voice it really works and it makes it fun when the right person stays with you and grows understands has the energy level buys into it believes in what we’re doing and you believe in each other it is fun and you’ve got to have fun it can’t just be “do this blah blah blah” with the right team reinforcing that that’s how you have comp store sales gains in our first  to  years we had comp sales gains every year but one one year we were down one point then we got hit with this recession and now we’re back to having comp sale gains how do you guys go about finding the right people training them and combining their values with yours you want somebody that’s in the lifestyle surfs skates snowboards listens to the music and loves what we’re doing the customer like all of us especially teenagers can smell bullshit they know if it’s authentic or not ultimately you can figure out what’s real and what’s fake and we try and make it real and have kids work for us who understand what that is maybe it’s an eight or nine or an yearold coming in with his parent it might be his first skateboard or shopping for back to school and having an employee that can understand the dynamic between the parent and the kid but also looks at the kid and talks with them you set that first level of trust and the employee likes what they do is into the sport connects with the kid what you get out of that is not just a sale but a good chance that you’re going to get a return customer and you’re going to own them for that eight ten years where they’re into that lifestyle through their teenage years and hopefully longer you can teach them employees certain techniques on selling but oftentimes people have the godgiven ability to sell something at regular price to another human being that’s a talent that’s going to help you the rest of your life whether you’re hucking a skateboard or selling complex medical equipment or being a professor at college you’ve got to deal with other humans the whole idea that we’re just going to social network on the web or whatever you’ve got to be able to look someone in the eye and talk about where you skate or the conditions up at baker or what kind of riding they do and relate campion and a zumiez employee at k in keystone colorado how do you personally stay connected to employees a lot of whom were born after zumiez started i started this precomputer and before any cell phones and kids look at me like i’m george frigging washington but that’s where you learn how to buy learn how to sell learn how to negotiate you’re doing counts with five stores you have somebody all day long calling up to see how many shirts they have to do reorders i read the journals go to all our events am deeply involved with the planning of them executing them and thanking our employees i network across the company all year long have conversations calling people just to thank them i travel a lot not specifically for zumiez also for other stuff i’m involved with i’ll meet kids in stores at seven in the morning for anyone who wants to come i just did a thing in chicago an event for the alaska wilderness league and went to the store in schaumburg— kids came out at seven in the morning until ten it was packed in there—talking about product what’s good what’s not what they’re doing well they want to hear what i’m thinking i want to hear what they’re thinking that’s one of many ways a company gets information it’s a small way compared to the whole buying chain and the communication with stores there but it keeps me connected then at the office i’m still not as close as i used to be when i ran the buying team a while ago— over ten years ago now—but enough to understand looking at product reports what’s selling what’s not and working with my president of all this lynn kilbourne or my store director ford wright or rick brooks my ceo with your dedication to your staff how do lawsuits such as the recent one over wages and lunch breaks affect you personally i can’t comment everybody sells when i go in a store i sell when our store director ford wright goes in a store and someone needs help he sells it’s based around a culture of selling product to our customers i think that’s enough said you do a lot of philanthropic work through the campion and zumiez foundations why is this important to you personally and for the business the year i started zumiez in ’ i started working in the environmental movement protecting old growth forests i’m a big fan of public lands we have million acres in this country managed between the forest service blm the department of the interior etc and it’s definitely an iconic american ideal—this public land that we all can enjoy there are sustainability issues around public lands and around the protection of viable populations of wildlife that utilize public land i’ve been in that forever i made a choice to start working in alaska back in the mid’s because it’s a third of our public land it’s got everything climate change issues huge landscapes indigenous people big oil driving the bus and politicians who just want to develop you and i own it it’s political will—is our will stronger than the person that just wants to drill baby drill it’s the same thing that works at zumiez—having the willpower and getting the right guy on the bus who loves what they do when did you launch your foundation and what have been some of your biggest successes in  when zumiez went public i’ve always given money and as zumiez has grown i’ve been able to give more the last couple years we’ve given away  million a year all from my selling of zumiez stock you always hear in the endemic market about giving back to the sports and this sounds like something deeply rooted in all the things you’re interested in zumiez has a foundation too that is a slightly different mission last year we gave away  jackets and about  wool blankets and cold weather gear we gave it to i think  different agencies across the country including veteran’s agencies and cultural centers the kids who work for me love it they work for more than just a paycheck and more than just the lifestyle they’re giving back we talk about that a lot we also have a mission and a foundation to encourage philanthropic work among our employees they pick what their passion is we’ve had some kids do some interesting things we had a kid in minnesota start his own non profit to work with innercity kids who couldn’t get skateboards and helped them get gear but the kid that gets that and works with different things they’re probably going to grow and become a better employee the whole idea is sharing and giving back it’s beneficial not only for them personally to grow but as they grow they become a better employee and it’s beneficial for zumiez what’s your take when you hear the hate and vitriol from kids and small shops around the country that zumiez isn’t core and doesn’t add to the sports when we got into skate and then snow in the late ’s there was a lot of that but we’re still standing and growing funding sponsorship events doing our own couch tour with an amateur contest where we’re pushing kids up to bigger events i think we’re pretty core it’s all the image of being in the mall versus a standalone store i would ask what core is versus a pure retailer that’s just driven by price and oftentimes dodging state sales tax where they’re shipping it into another state i just talked to some elected officials about that where i’m employing kids in their state trying to grow it where the next guy who’s a pure etailer can ship something in the state and not pay sales tax i’m not only employing people in their state but collecting taxes that pay for teachers and educate the kids that come to work for me or the firemen that’s something we need to correct and make it equitable for brick and mortar retailers across the country i will tell you there’s a pecking order to competition in the mall from pacsun to tilly’s to industrial we’re in business to keep growing we understand that to do that it’s great to have a competitor because it makes you sharper i want that sale i don’t want to give it to them that’s good ol’ american retail  about growing and dominating the competition you got to have kids that want that that want the sale and believe in what they’re doing i’ve read that one of your business philosophies is to always reinvent yourself and your products to succeed how are you doing that today to get zumiez’s trajectory back up where it was before the recession we’re mixing up products the vendors we carry and the classifications some things are pretty core like denim tshirts screenables and stuff like that we’re a branded store we’re americas branded independent retailer is what we say that makes it somewhat easier price isn’t necessarily the answer to that however some things in the last  couple years are more incentively priced and some things with this economy you just have to be patient and let the market come back what started in the secondhalf of ’ was the toughest i’ve ever seen it and i’ve been in retail since  sometimes it’s just a matter of having patience and explaining that to the kid that’s working for you rather than sitting there pounding on him or her because

on feb   how do they even exist its ridiculous being forced to purchase from a business that clearly hates its customers and they know were all trapped with no other option i cant think of a single other business that has it so good if there were any other bookshop to get this stuff from i would go there there used to be a different one that we used to go to it was like shopping at diagon alley for hogwarts aisles of every kind of school supply you can imagine and filling our baskets was a joy but now theres only campion where they read more make you wait in queues reminiscent of customs in an airport two queues and then wait for your name to be called could be an hour could be two alternatively you can order the stuff online and receive it in dribs and drabs over the course of term

comment  helpful vote private message dont use this business campion book is the worst  out of  reviewed on feb   my son is new to the school and we had to order some text book from campion then we found out that he was put in an accelerated maths class and he no longer need his current maths book which he hasnt use at all however he fortunately put his name on a sticky tape on top of the book in which he just peeled it off and you can see a trace of it which i didnt the book is brand new hasnt use it or anything i and anyone would have just buy it myself again in that kind of condition anyhow so the cashier was doing a refund she suddenl read more y said to me in a very unfriendly voice i cant refund this it go his name on it i just took it from her and rub it and it just came off with no marks or anything and handed it back to her but still she wont refund me the money so i asked to talk to the manager she came out took the book and said no she cant refund it because it got dust and finger marks on it i cant believe this off course its got fingermarks on it because we are all holding it then i said ill clean it and she almost threw the book at me and said if you can clean it i think about it i just took the tissue and cleaned off the fingerprints and dusts and she still doesnt want to refund me she took it around to her staffs and showed them and said some words to me which werent polite about would you buy a book like this of course i would because it is brand new and hasnt been use except it have left their shop i told her that angus and robertson wouldnt look at a returned book under a microscope like her and she said we are not angus and robertson are we talking about rude and bad manner  and this comes from a manager can you belive this i wouldnt return a book if its in bad condition in which they cant resell it because i know people need to make a living but this is horrible eventually i got the refund but it just not worth the hassle i got two kids still at school for another  years or so but i would try to buy anything from campion for sure you cant refund stationery better get them from office work  its cheaper and you can return easily similar opinion write a review  person found this helpful do you yes comments campion education official dear hua thank you for the feedback in general it is difficult to take back books that

new hua posted on feb   jennyp perth  reviews  comments  helpful vote private message seriously  out of  reviewed on feb   every year i dread having to order from this business seriously you order and pay for the order in full late novemberearly december and many of the books dont arrive until mid term one for  i have a year eleven student and needed to ensure all books were received so she could review these prior to taking classes the school has a great system at the end of the year where you can buy the books from the current year cohort and i always try and do this however the maths books were being reviewed and others i couldnt get hold of so i need read more ed the new books week two and they are nowhere in sight yep the teacher has started the program and a few of the girls have them we cant complete homework as we dont have the books nor can my daughter keep up in the class because she doesnt have the books the school does assist as much as they can however at the end of the day campion are responsible last year i recalled the english book they were reading arrived the last week of term one the same week they finished the book in class could i get a refund for the unopened book no this year im told the maths books are on their way and now in the hands of australia post so not our problem anymore i do pity the staff having to take these calls i really do but someone has to take responsibility i truly think someone like today tonight have to get into this business and publicly name and shame them youd think having the cash in the bank for two months would

which had been sent to us i said we havent received it i was told if we wanted a text book that was  which also included the ebook i said well of course for  extra we w read more ould have both the physical book and the ebook no thats not possible i was told as you have been issued with the ebook code but we have not received it i said so cant we just be sent the book which will also include the ebook no i was told you have paid for the ebook and my job is to fulfill your order so i have just emailed you your ecode i said i dont want to use it if it is going to exclude us from getting the physical book i was told i could spend an additional  to purchase the book when i said this was crazy and asked whether i could speak to someone else a supervisor or manager the person refused she said there was nothing i could do she said she worked in a call centre and there were no supervisors i said surely there was someone at campion that i could speak to no i was told i asked there must be a manager at the company that i could speak to or write to no i was told i was provided with an email address  salescampion and was advised that the email would go to the person i was speaking to in any event i still have the email code i was emailed on tuesday and my daughter has had no maths book all week i havent used the code because i dont want to be excluded from getting the book so my daughter is still yet to do her maths homework which is due after the weekend my daughter is very stressed about it i have not even had a chance to seek help about our other issue with my other

website and the read more y had it in stock also the  files which seemed to have not been delivered with our order were available at office works maybe made in the same factory as the campion education ones but a different code the campion education staff member i talked to couldnt get me off the phone fast enough as she had phone calls which were backing up she asked me to ring back when i was having trouble finding the code of the file i had spent  minutes waiting to talk to her and was not about to do that again campion education need more staff who can fill orders with a lot more care and then they would not have this mess and now terrible reputation they obviously cannot keep going the way they are as schools will not support them management of campion education need to have a serious look at how their business is run similar opinion write a review  people found this helpful do you yes comments campion education official hello were sorry youve had this experience we will

told the missing items were on back order but after refusing to accept this explanation items were miraculously found and sent out i received  different parcels on same day but still had items missing

run around that no supervisor was available demanded i speak to a supervisor and was then put through to name removed who i asked to esculate this matter to a manager as i was not confident in dealing with the sales or supervising staff any further she stated this was not possible and wouldnt even give me a name of a manager she also stated that the stylus had only come in today feel totally unrespected by this company by the obvious lies i have been fed and the run around i have been given obviously there are serious issues with this company and when dealing with resolutions they are

incompetence similar opinion write a review was this review helpful yes comments campion education official dear lena this sounds like a really frustrating experience and were very sorry to hear about
