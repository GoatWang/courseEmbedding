directors lone star value seeks to upgrade cibers board of directors criticizes boards poor performance corporate governance and compensation practicesnominates slate of three highlyqualified independent director candidates feb    et from lone star value management llc new york feb   prnewswire  lone star value management llc together with its affiliates lone star value we or us is a significant longterm shareholder of ciber inc ciber or the company nyse cbr with ownership of approximately  million shares of common stock  lone star value announced today that it delivered a formal notice to ciber of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the board of directors of ciber the board at the upcoming  annual meeting of ciber shareholders the  annual meeting lone star value is dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and improving shareholder rights for all ciber shareholders  in our view upgrading the incumbent board is a critical first step for shareholders to realize our goals lone star value believes that cibers stock is deeply undervalued due in large part to failures of oversight by the incumbent board and poor corporate governance  we fear many of the incumbent board members are more focused on their director fees and the prestige of serving on a public board in their hometown of denver than they are on maximizing value for cibers shareholders  during chairman jacobs tenure as a board member for example cbr stock has declined by more than  while he has made over  million in director fees  in addition average board member compensation during chairman jacobs tenure has risen from approximately  per year to approximately  per year and is paid mainly in cash  not the compensation terms shareholders want to see in a turnaround situation  as a sign of a poorly performing board management team turnover has been alarmingly high over the past ten years with four different ceos and four different cfos  we believe the incumbent board until very recently has repeatedly failed to find a suitable ceo to lead the company toward profitability and performance in line with its peers  cibers dismal operating performance for example is represented by a cumulative net loss to shareholders of more than  million share since  in gaap earnings and it has reported annual net losses in gaap earnings every year since  while its industry peers were much more profitable during this time period to be clear we have tremendous confidence in cibers new ceo michael boustridge  we believe he and his management team are beginning to execute on a longawaited turnaround of cibers operations as evidenced by cibers improved financial results in q   of course the incumbent board will try to take credit for hiring mr boustridge as ceo but it should be pointed out that the incumbent board only hired mr boustridge as ceo after our activist effort was initiated a year ago after lone star value gained representation on the board and after it had become undeniable that the previous ceo david peterschmidt hired by chairman paul jacobs had been a failure over his year tenure  we also have deep respect for ciber board member and company founder bobby stevenson both for founding the company and for owning almost  of its stock  unlike the other board members we believe mr stevenson thinks like an owner and is much more focused on shareholder value creation than his director fees we believe this board has failed in one of the most important roles for any board  recruiting the right management talent and creating the right incentives by compensating them based on performance  cibers unfortunate history with its former ceo mr peterschmidt is a strong example of the boards failure in this regard  chairman jacobs hired david peterschmidt as ceo in july  a time when ciber was in desperate need of a turnaround but unfortunately mr peterschmidt had no turnaround expertise  two years into mr peterschmidts tenure the board had apparently become concerned about his performance and decided to appoint mr boustridge to the board so he could step in as ceo if needed  a direct quote from chairman jacobs in  clearly explains the reasoning behind adding mr boustridge to the board in  michael was brought onto our board two years ago with succession planning in mind  we are fortunate to have a strong and qualified candidate with global operating experience  and because michael has been on our board he has a perspective of the role that no outside candidate could bring yet despite every indication that mr peterschmidt was grossly underperforming and had been for two years the board did nothing about it for another two years  it was not until lone star value launched a campaign to seek change on the board in  that cibers incumbent directors finally took action to replace the failed ceo  even then this board which well knew that mr boustridge would replace mr peterschmidt as ceo still renewed mr peterschmidts contract on march   and kept him on the payroll as a consultant for an additional year after his replacement as ceo  this board led by chairman jacobs rewarded mr peterschmidt with an exit package worth more than  million  mr peterschmidts exit package included a  oneyear consulting contract  cbr shares medical benefits moving costs from colorado to california closing costs related to the sale of mr peterschmidts home and the cost of renewing his executives status as a global services member on united airlines for two years  we believe mr peterschmidts superfluous addition to his compensation package was completely unnecessary and not required by his employment contract – essentially it was a tip while presiding over a period of disruptive management turnover and unnecessary compensation practices the board has also continually had poor corporate governance which is a sure sign of an entrenched board  the board has shown little appetite for fresh perspective in the boardroom with barely any turnover over the last  years  further the board has sought to stifle shareholders ability to seek change on the board through among other things a classified board structure and an absolute prohibition on the shareholders ability to call special meetings or act by written consent  leading proxy advisory firm institutional shareholders services iss rates cibers overall corporate governance with the lowest possible governance score of  on a scale of  to  with  indicating maximum corporate governance risk  two specific corporate governance areas have been highlighted by iss in its  grade maximum governance risk rating – shareholder rights and executive compensation furthermore through the course of our involvement with ciber the board has shown disregard for shareholder input and nonchalance in breaking its contractual commitments to shareholders  last year pursuant to an agreement with lone star value the incumbent board agreed to add a shareholder representative on the board richard coleman who has added tremendous value in the boardroom and whom we are renominating for election to the board this year in our agreement the board committed to actively search for two additional board members in order to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board  in the year since then one director betsy atkins joined the board but promptly resigned after only three months  other than that there is no evidence that the board took its obligations to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board seriously  in failing to replace ms atkins and to add an additional new director the board led by mr jacobs failed to honor its responsibilities to shareholders and its agreement with us lone star value has clearly expressed its views on the urgent need for improvement of cibers board and corporate governance practices to chairman jacobs in numerous calls and emails  the incumbent board has so far refused to make the necessary changes to avoid a proxy contest  we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the behavior of the incumbent board will not change unless the personnel changes  we are convinced that reconstituting the board is imperative to improving shareholder value and rights  an upgraded board will be in a far stronger position to help the new management team in their continuing turnaround efforts at ciber  accordingly lone star value today submitted formal nominations of three highlyqualified director candidates richard k coleman jr robert g pearse and joshua schechter for election to the board at the  annual meeting  our nominees experience encompasses technology telecom business services financial and turnaround expertise  messrs coleman pearse and schechter not only possess substantial and relevant turnaround experience and a wellbalanced mix of skills but each also boasts an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value  each is committed to the highest levels of corporate governance  these proven valuecreators will ensure that the company evaluates with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency all strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders if elected by our fellow shareholders our highlyqualified and experienced board nominees will immediately seek to align the companys interests with maximizing shareholder value improving the fundamental operations of the business to an operational level on par with its direct competitors and steer the company toward longterm profitability  our goal is to inject a sense of urgency while implementing a coherent strategy between the board and management team which will ultimately yield an increase in shareholder value shareholders can no longer put their faith in the incumbent board that has historically eroded shareholder value delayed cibers needed operating turnaround and stubbornly refused to implement proactive change on the board  at this stage change on the board should be made by the shareholders and for the shareholders we believe that only the shareholders and not the incumbent board should be allowed to choose new directors  we caution the board against thinly veiled reactive measures to entrench themselves under the guise of proactive action  we further remind the incumbent directors of their fiduciary duty to shareholders particularly in the context of any potential proxy contest and that actions taken in violation of shareholder rights and destructive of shareholder value may expose incumbent directors to liability that exceeds any do insurance coverage lone star value remains open to a meaningful dialogue with the board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to reconstitute the board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders  if no agreement is reached however lone star value is fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to elect all three of its director nominees at the  annual meeting  our nominees if elected will take their fiduciary responsibility very seriously and will represent the interests of all shareholders lone star values independent and highlyqualified candidates are richard k coleman jr age  is the founder and president of rocky mountain venture services  since  his company has helped
