description of business and basis of presentation   description of business  equus total return inc  “we” “us” “our” “equus” the “company” and the “fund ” a delaware corporation was formed by equus investments ii lp the “partnership” on august   on july   the partnership was reorganized and all of the assets and liabilities of the partnership were transferred to the fund in exchange for shares of common stock of the fund our shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol eqs on august   our shareholders approved the change of the fund’s investment strategy to a total return investment objective this strategy seeks to provide the highest total return consisting of capital appreciation and current income in connection with this strategic investment change the shareholders also approved the change of name from equus ii incorporated to equus total return inc   we attempt to maximize the return to stockholders in the form of current investment income and longterm capital gains by investing in the debt and equity securities of companies with a total enterprise value of between  million and  million although we may engage in transactions with smaller or larger investee companies from time to time we seek to invest primarily in companies pursuing growth either through acquisition or organically leveraged buyouts management buyouts and recapitalizations of existing businesses or special situations our incomeproducing investments consist principally of debt securities including subordinate debt debt convertible into common or preferred stock or debt combined with warrants and common and preferred stock debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create longterm capital appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing we seek to achieve capital appreciation by making investments in equity and equityoriented securities issued by privatelyowned companies or smaller public companies in transactions negotiated directly with such companies given market conditions over the past several years and the performance of our portfolio our management and board of directors believe it prudent to continue to review alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies   we elected to be treated as a business development company “bdc” under the  act we currently qualify as a regulated investment company “ric” for federal income tax purposes and therefore are not required to pay corporate income taxes on any income or gains that we distribute to our stockholders we have certain wholly owned taxable subsidiaries “taxable subsidiaries” each of which holds one or more portfolio investments listed on our schedules of investments the purpose of these taxable subsidiaries is to permit us to hold certain incomeproducing investments or portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies or llcs or other forms of passthrough entities and still satisfy the ric tax requirement that at least  of our gross revenue for income tax purposes must consist of investment income absent the taxable subsidiaries a portion of the gross income of these incomeproducing investments or of any llc or other passthrough entity portfolio investment as the case may be would flow through directly to us for the  test to the extent that such income did not consist of investment income it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a ric and therefore cause us to incur significant federal income taxes the income of the llcs or other passthrough entities owned by taxable subsidiaries is taxed to the taxable subsidiaries and does not flow through to us thereby helping us preserve our ric status and resultant tax advantages we do not consolidate the taxable subsidiaries for income tax purposes and they may generate income tax expense because of the taxable subsidiaries’ ownership of the portfolio companies we reflect any such income tax expense on our statements of operations   basis of presentation  in accordance with article  of regulation sx under the securities act of  and the securities exchange act of  we do not consolidate portfolio company investments including those in which we have a controlling interest our interim unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap for interim financial information and in accordance with the requirements of reporting on form q and article  of regulation sx under the securities exchange act of  as amended accordingly they are unaudited and exclude some disclosures required for annual financial statements management believes it has made all adjustments consisting solely of normal recurring accruals necessary for the fair presentation of these interim financial statements   the results of operations for the six months ended june   are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the remainder of the year the interim unaudited financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the fund’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   as filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec”        table of contents        liquidity and financing arrangements   liquidity  there are several factors that may materially affect our liquidity during the reasonably foreseeable future we view this period as the twelve month period from the date of the financial statements in this form q ie  the period through june   we are evaluating the impact of current market conditions on our portfolio company valuations and the ability of these companies to provide current income we have followed valuation techniques in a consistent manner however we are cognizant of current market conditions that might affect future valuations of portfolio securities we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine followon investments if any through the next twelve months   cash and cash equivalents  as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million we had  million of our net assets of  million invested in portfolio securities we also had  million of restricted cash and temporary cash investments including primarily the proceeds of a quarterend margin loan that we incurred to maintain the diversification requirements applicable to a ric to maintain our passthrough tax treatment of this amount  million was invested in us treasury bills and  million represented a required  brokerage margin deposit these securities were held by a securities brokerage firm and pledged along with other assets to secure repayment of the margin loan the us treasury bills were sold on july   and we subsequently repaid this margin loan plus interest on july     as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million we had  million of our net assets of  million invested in portfolio securities we also had  million of temporary cash investments and restricted cash including primarily the proceeds of a quarterend margin loan that we incurred to maintain the diversification requirements applicable to a ric of this amount  million was invested in us treasury bills and  million represented a required  brokerage margin deposit these securities were held by a securities brokerage firm and pledged along with other assets to secure repayment of the margin loan the us treasury bills were sold on january   and we subsequently repaid this margin loan the margin interest was paid on february     dividends  we will pay out net investment income andor realized capital gains if any on an annual basis as required under the  act   investment commitments  as of june   we had no outstanding commitments to our portfolio company investments   under certain circumstances we may be called on to make followon investments in certain portfolio companies if we do not have sufficient funds to make followon investments the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted also our equity interest in the estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced   ric borrowings restricted cash and temporary cash investments  we may periodically borrow sufficient funds to maintain the fund’s ric status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm we cannot assure you that such arrangement will be available in the future if we are unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments we may no longer qualify as a ric we would then be subject to corporate income tax on the fund’s net investment income and realized capital gains and distributions to stockholders would be subject to income tax as ordinary dividends failure to continue to qualify as a ric could be materially adverse to us and our stockholders   as of june   we borrowed  million to maintain our ric status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm we collateralized such borrowings with restricted cash and temporary cash investments in us treasury bills of  million   as of december   we borrowed  million to maintain our ric status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm we collateralized such borrowings with restricted cash and temporary cash investments in us treasury bills of  million   certain risks and uncertainties  market and economic volatility which has become endemic in the past few years has resulted in a relatively limited amount of available debt financing for small and mediumsized companies such as equus and its portfolio companies such debt financing generally has shorter maturities higher interest rates and fees and more restrictive terms than debt facilities available in the past in addition during these years and continuing into the first six months of  the price of our common stock remained well below our net asset value thereby making it undesirable to issue additional shares of our common stock below net asset value because of these challenges our nearterm strategies shifted from originating debt and equity investments to preserving liquidity necessary to meet our operational needs key initiatives that we have previously undertaken to provide necessary liquidity include monetizations the suspension of dividends and the internalization of management although we cannot assure you that such initiatives will be sufficient we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for the remainder of  and the first six months of       table of contents        significant accounting policies   the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements   use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these financial statements and related notes are reasonable in light of known facts and circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates   valuation of investments  we follow asc topic  for measuring fair value prior to our election to become a bdc we also followed the guidance in asc topic  in disclosing the fair value reported for all financial instruments that were either impaired or available for sale securities using the definitions provided in accounting standards codification topic  “investments – debt and equity securities” “asc topic ” fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  inputs are broadly defined under asc topic  as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under asc topic  are described below   level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs other than quoted prices within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies   level   inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability the inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation   we consider a twostep process when appraising investments of privately held companies the first step involves determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company during this step we consider three different valuation approaches a market approach an income approach and a cost approach the particular facts and circumstances of each portfolio company determine which approach or combination of approaches will be utilized the second step when appraising equity investments of privately held companies involves allocating value to the various debt and equity securities of the portfolio company we allocate value to these securities based on their relative priorities for equity securities such as warrants we may also incorporate alternative methodologies including the blackscholes option pricing model yield analysis is also employed to determine if a debt security has been impaired   in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an investment’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment   investments for which prices are not observable are generally private investments in the debt and equity securities of operating companies the primary valuation method used to estimate the fair value of these level  investments is the discounted cash flow method although a liquidation analysis option theoretical or other methodology may be used when more appropriate the discounted cash flow approach to determine fair value or a range of fair values involves applying an appropriate discount rates to the estimated future cash flows using various relevant factors depending on investment type including comparing the latest arm’s length or market transactions involving the subject security to the selected benchmark credit spread assumed growth rate in cash flows and capitalization ratesmultiples for determining terminal values of underlying portfolio companies the valuation based on the inputs determined to be the most reasonable and probable is used as the fair value of the investment the determination of fair value using these methodologies may take into consideration a range of factors including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired the nature of the investment local market conditions trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities current and projected operating performance financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and anticipated financing transactions after the valuation date application of these valuation methodologies involves a significant degree of judgment by management fair values of new investments are generally assumed to be equal to their cost to the fund for up to twelve months after their initial purchase        table of contents     to assess the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow approach the fair value of equity securities including warrants in portfolio companies may also consider the market approach—that is through analyzing and applying to the underlying portfolio companies market valuation multiples of publiclytraded firms engaged in businesses similar to those of the portfolio companies the market approach to determining the fair value of a portfolio company’s equity security or securities will typically involve  applying to the portfolio company’s trailing twelve months or current year projected ebitda a low to high range of enterprise value to ebitda multiples that are derived from an analysis of publiclytraded comparable companies in order to arrive at a range of enterprise values for the portfolio company  subtracting from the range of calculated enterprise values the outstanding balances of any debt or equity securities that would be senior in right of payment to the equity securities we hold and  multiplying the range of equity values derived therefrom by our ownership share of such equity tranche in order to arrive at a range of fair values for our equity security or securities application of these valuation methodologies involves a significant degree of judgment by management   due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of level  investments that do not have a readily available market value the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled further such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale we might realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded with respect to level  investments where sufficient market quotations are not readily available or for which no or an insufficient number of indicative prices from pricing services or brokers or dealers have been received we undertake on a quarterly basis a valuation process as described below   •   for each debt investment a basic credit review process is completed the risk profile on every credit facility is reviewed and either reaffirmed or revised by our investment committee   •   each portfolio company or investment is valued by an investment professional   •   third party valuation firms are engaged to provide valuation services as requested by reviewing management’s preliminary valuations andor analysis of the portfolio investment in question for investments with a fair value exceeding  million held for more than  year our management’s preliminary fair value conclusions on each of the fund’s assets for which sufficient market quotations are not readily available is reviewed and assessed by a thirdparty valuation firm at least once in every month period and more often as determined by the audit committee or required by our valuation policy such valuation assessment may be in the form of positive assurance range of values or another valuation method based on the discretion of our board   •   the audit committee reviews the preliminary valuations of our management and independent valuation firms and if appropriate recommends the approval of the valuations by the board   •   our board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of management the audit committee and where appropriate the respective independent valuation firms   the following sections describe the valuation techniques we use to measure different financial instruments at fair value and include the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the financial instruments are categorized   market approach  the market approach typically employed by management calculates the enterprise value of a company as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” generated by the company for the trailing twelve month period adjustments to the company’s ebitda including those for nonrecurring items may be considered multiples are estimated based on current market conditions and past experience in the private company marketplace and are subjective in nature we will apply liquidity and other discounts as deemed appropriate to equity valuations where applicable we may also use when available thirdparty transactions in a portfolio company’s securities as the basis of valuation the “private market method” the private market method will be used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated independent investors   income approach  the income approach typically utilized by our management calculates the enterprise value of a company utilizing a discounted cash flow model incorporating projected future cash flows of the company projected future cash flows consider the historical performance of the company as well as current and projected market participant performance discount rates are estimated based on current market conditions and past experience in the private company marketplace and are subjective in nature we will apply liquidity and other discounts as deemed appropriate to equity valuations where applicable        table of contents     asset approach  we consider the asset approach to determine the fair value of significantly deteriorated investments demonstrating circumstances indicative of a liquidation analysis this situation may arise when a portfolio company  cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its indebtedness  is not successful in refinancing its debt upon maturity  we believe the credit quality of a loan has deteriorated due to changes in the business and underlying asset or market conditions may result in the company’s inability to meet future obligations or  the portfolio company’s reorganization or bankruptcy consideration is also given as to whether a liquidation event would be orderly or forced   we base adjustments upon such factors as the portfolio company’s earnings cash flow and net worth the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies an assessment of the company’s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions in the case of unsuccessful or substantially declining operations we may base a portfolio company’s fair value upon the company’s estimated liquidation value fair valuations are necessarily subjective and our estimate of fair value may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of its portfolio securities also any failure by a portfolio company to achieve its business plan or obtain and maintain its financing arrangements could result in increased volatility and result in a significant and rapid change in its value   our general intent is to hold our loans to maturity when appraising our privately held debt investments as such we believe that the fair value will not exceed the cost of the investment however in addition to the previously described analysis involving allocation of value to the debt instrument we will often perform a yield analysis to determine if a debt security has been impaired certificates of deposit purchased by the fund generally will be valued at their face value plus interest accrued to the date of valuation   for most of our investments market quotations are not available with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value our board has approved a multistep valuation process each quarter as described below      each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals and where necessary with independent valuation firms engaged by the fund      the independent valuation firms conduct independent valuations and make their own independent assessments      the audit committee of our board reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of the fund and that of the independent valuation firms and      the board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our management the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee   investments are valued utilizing a yield analysis enterprise value “ev” analysis net asset value analysis liquidation analysis discounted cash flow analysis or a combination of methods as appropriate the yield analysis uses loan spreads and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities under the ev analysis the ev of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company’s securities in order of their preference relative to one another ie “waterfall” allocation to determine the ev we typically use a market multiples approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies transaction metrics from precedent ma transactions andor a discounted cash flow analysis the net asset value analysis is used to derive a value of an underlying investment such as real estate property by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate for this purpose we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies andor relevant transactions the liquidation analysis is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on among other things assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company’s assets the discounted cash flow analysis uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate the measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts   in applying these methodologies additional factors that we consider in fair value pricing our investments may include as we deem relevant security covenants call protection provisions and information rights the nature and realizable value of any collateral the portfolio company’s ability to make payments the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business publicly available financial ratios of peer companies the principal market and enterprise values among other factors   because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable market values amounting to  million and  million as of june   and december   respectively our fair value determinations may materially differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these securities as of june   one of our portfolio investments  common shares of mvc was publicly listed on the nyse as of december   one of our portfolio investments  common shares of mvc was publicly listed on the nyse      table of contents     we adjust our net asset value for the changes in the value of our publicly held securities if applicable and material changes in the value of private securities generally determined on a quarterly basis or as announced in a press release and report those amounts to lipper analytical services inc our net asset value appears in various publications including barron’s and the wall street journal    for loan and debt securities held for longer than one year the fund will often perform a yield analysis assuming a hypothetical current sale of the security the yield analysis considers changes in interest rates and changes in leverage levels of the portfolio company as compared to the market interest rates and leverage levels assuming the credit quality of the portfolio company remains stable the fund will use the value determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security   we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we determine that the fair value of a security is less than its cost basis and will record unrealized appreciation when we determine that the fair value is greater than its cost basis   we assess the levels of the investments at each measurement date and transfers between levels are recognized on the subsequent measurement date closest in time to the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer there were no transfers among level   and  for the quarter ended june   and the year ended december     as of june   investments

realized   investment transactions  investment transactions are recorded on the accrual method realized gains and losses on investments sold are computed on a specific identification basis      table of contents     we classify our investments in accordance with the requirements of the  act under the  act “control investments” are defined as investments in companies in which the fund owns more than  of the voting securities or maintains greater than  of the board representation under the  act “affiliate investments” are defined as those noncontrol investments in companies in which we own between  and  of the voting securities under the  act “nonaffiliate investments” are defined as investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments   as of june   and december   we had no outstanding commitments to our portfolio company investments however under certain circumstances we may be called on to make followon investments in certain portfolio companies if we do not have sufficient funds to make followon investments the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted also our equity interest in the estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced followon investments may include capital infusions which are expenditures made directly to or on behalf of the portfolio company to ensure that operations are completed thereby allowing the portfolio company to generate cash flows to service their debt   interest income recognition  we record interest income adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts we accrete or amortize discounts and premiums on securities purchased over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discount andor amortization of premium on debt securities we stop accruing interest on investments when we determine that interest is no longer collectible we may also impair the accrued interest when we determine that all or a portion of the current accrual is uncollectible if we receive any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible we treat such cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid before we recognize any additional interest income we will write off uncollectible interest upon the occurrence of a definitive event such as a sale bankruptcy or reorganization of the relevant portfolio interest   payment in kind interest pik  we have loans in our portfolio that may pay pik interest we add pik interest if any computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income to maintain our status as a ric we must pay out to stockholders this noncash source of income in the form of dividends even if we have not yet collected any cash in respect of such investments we will continue to pay out net investment income andor realized capital gains if any on an annual basis as required under the investment company act of    cash flows  for purposes of the statements of cash flows we consider all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents we include our investing activities within cash flows from operations we exclude “restricted cash and temporary cash investments” used for purposes of complying with ric requirements from cash equivalents   taxes  we intend to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains which is distributed to stockholders therefore no provision for federal income taxes is recorded in the financial statements we borrow money from time to time to maintain our tax status under the internal revenue code as a ric see note  for discussion of taxable subsidiaries and see note  for further discussion of the fund’s ric borrowings   all corporations organized in the state of delaware are required to file an annual report and to pay a franchise tax as a result we paid delaware franchise tax in the

margin tax is based on our texas sourced taxable margin the tax is calculated by applying a tax rate to a base that considers both revenue and expenses and therefore has the characteristics of an income tax as a result we have no provision for margin tax expense for the three and six months ended june   respectively and we did not owe state income tax for the year ended december     significant unobservable inputs  our investment portfolio is not composed of homogeneous debt and equity securities that can be valued with a small number of inputs instead the majority of our investment portfolio is composed of complex debt and equity securities with distinct contract terms and conditions as such our valuation of each investment in our portfolio is unique and complex often factoring in numerous different inputs including historical and forecasted financial and operational performance of the portfolio company project cash flows market multiples comparable market

energy for the purpose of additional working capital and to fund the purchase of  million in working interests which presently comprise  producing and nonproducing oil and gas wells the working interests include associated development rights of approximately  acres situated on  separate properties in texas and oklahoma the working interests range from a de minimus amount to  of the leasehold that includes these wells   the wells are operated by a number of experienced operators including chevron usa inc which has operating responsibility for all of equus energy’s  producing well interests located in the conger field a productive oil and gas field on the edge of the permian basin that has experienced successful gas and hydrocarbon extraction in multiple formations equus energy which

“the company” follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties under the full cost method all costs associated with property acquisition exploration and development activities are capitalized capitalized costs include lease acquisitions geological and geophysical work delay rentals costs of drilling completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related costs gains or losses are normally not recognized on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties gains or losses are normally reflected as an adjustment to the full cost pool   the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated cost of dismantlement and abandonment net of salvage value are amortized

unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized and   c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized   when it is

impairment loss on its oil and gas properties during the six months ended june   however during  the company recognized an impairment loss of  million   the costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage and certain wells being drilled are not amortized the company excludes all costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired costs not amortized are periodically assessed for possible impairment or reduction in value if a reduction in value has occurred costs being amortized are increased accordingly    revenue recognition  revenue recognized for oil and natural gas sales under the sales method of accounting under this method revenue recognized on production as it is taken and delivered to its purchasers the volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes entitled to based on the owner’s net leasehold interest these differences result from production imbalances which are not significant and are reflected as adjustments to proven reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited consolidated financial information included herein   accounting policy on dda  the company employs the “units of production” method in calculating depletion of its proved oil and gas properties wherein capitalized costs as adjusted for future development costs and asset retirement obligations are amortized over the total estimated proved reserves   income taxes  a limited liability company is not subject to the payment of federal income taxes as items of income and expenses flow through directly to its members however the company may be liable for certain state income taxes texas margin tax applies to legal entities conducting business in texas and is assessed on the company’s texas sourced taxable margin the tax is calculated by applying the appropriate tax rate to a base that considers both revenue and expenses and therefore has the characteristics of an income tax taxable subsidiaries may also generate income tax expense because of the taxable subsidiaries’ ownership of the portfolio companies as such we reflect any such income tax expense on our statements of operations  as of june   and june   the company recorded  in federal income taxes    asset retirement obligations  the fair value of asset retirement obligations are recorded in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset  the fair value of the asset retirement obligation is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the company’s creditadjusted riskfree interest rate  fair value to the extent possible should include a market risk premium for unforeseeable circumstances  no market risk premium was included in the company’s asset retirement obligation fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could not be made  the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and

longterm capital gains by investing in the debt and equity securities of companies with a total enterprise value of between  million and  million although we may engage in transactions with smaller or larger investee companies from time to time we seek to invest primarily in companies pursuing growth either through acquisition or organically leveraged buyouts management buyouts and recapitalizations of existing businesses or special situations our incomeproducing investments consist principally of debt securities including subordinate debt debt convertible into common or preferred stock or debt combined with warrants and common and preferred stock debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create longterm capital appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing we seek to achieve capital appreciation by making investments in equity and equityoriented securities issued by privatelyowned companies and smaller public companies in transactions negotiated directly with such companies given market conditions over the past several years and the performance of our portfolio our management and board of directors believe it is prudent to continue to review alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies        table of contents     we elected to be treated as a bdc under the  act we currently qualify as a ric for federal income tax purposes and therefore are not required to pay corporate income taxes on any income or gains that we distribute to our stockholders we have certain wholly owned taxable subsidiaries each of which holds one or more portfolio investments listed on our schedules of investments the purpose of these taxable subsidiaries is to permit us to hold certain incomeproducing investments or portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies or llcs or other forms of passthrough entities and still satisfy the ric tax requirement that at least  of our gross revenue for income tax purposes must consist of investment income absent the taxable subsidiaries a portion of the gross income of these incomeproducing investments or of any llc or other passthrough entity portfolio investment as the case may be would flow through directly to us for the  test to the extent that such income did not consist of investment income it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a ric and therefore cause us to incur significant federal income taxes the income of the llcs or other passthrough entities owned by taxable subsidiaries is taxed to the taxable subsidiaries and does not flow through to us thereby helping us preserve our ric status and resultant tax advantages we do not consolidate the taxable subsidiaries for income tax purposes and they may generate income tax expense because of the taxable subsidiaries’ ownership of the portfolio investments we reflect any such income tax expense on our statements of operations   plan of reorganization   on may   we announced that the fund intended to effect a reorganization pursuant to section a of the  act as a first step to consummating the reorganization we sold to mvc  newlyissued shares of the fund’s common stock in exchange for  shares of mvc such transaction is hereinafter referred to as the “share exchange” mvc is a business development company traded on the new york stock exchange that provides longterm debt and equity investment capital to fund growth acquisitions and recapitalizations of companies in a variety of industries the share exchange was calculated based on the fund’s and mvc’s respective net asset value per share at the time of the share exchange the number of mvc shares received by equus represented approximately  of mvc’s total outstanding shares of common stock and the number of equus shares sold to mvc represented approximately  of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock we incurred dilution of  per share as a result of the share exchange since the announcement we have received  shares of mvc market value of  million calculated as of the date of receipt in the form of dividend payments   pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement dated may   entered into by equus and mvc which memorialized the share exchange we intend to finalize the reorganization by pursuing a merger or consolidation with mvc or a subsidiary of mvc or one or more of mvc’s portfolio companies the “consolidation” absent equus merging or consolidating withinto mvc our current intention is for equus to i consummate the consolidation ii terminate its election to be classified as a business development company under the  act and iii be restructured as a publiclytraded operating company focused on the energy andor financial services sector   equity incentive plan   on june   the equus shareholders approved the adoption of the fund’s  equity incentive plan the “plan”  the plan is intended to promote the interests of the fund by encouraging officers employees and directors of the fund and its affiliates to acquire or increase their equity interest in the fund and to provide a means whereby they may develop a proprietary interest in the development and financial success of the fund to encourage them to remain with and devote their best efforts to the business of the fund thereby advancing the interests of the fund and its stockholders the plan is also intended to enhance the ability of the fund and its affiliates to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential for the growth and profitability of the fund  although certain elements of the plan require approval from the sec and may therefore be subsequently modified the plan permits the award of restricted stock as well as common stock purchase options  the maximum number of shares of common stock that are subject to awards granted under the plan is  shares  the term of the plan will expire on june    no awards have been granted under the plan and consequently no compensation expense has been recorded for the three and six months ended june     critical accounting policies   see the fund’s critical accounting policies from the disclosure set forth in the

 following an annualized increase of  during the first quarter of  the low growth during the first half of  was principally attributed to lower inventories and business investment and also came in spite of a relatively strong housing market as well as consumer spending in addition to healthy corporate profits in a survey of  economists the wall street journal has predicted gdp growth of  for

cnbc cnn money bloomberg forbes    market conditions for business transactions during  including mergers and acquisitions and private equity investments improved to their highest level  trillion since prior to the  financial crisis such activity has declined in the first half of  as a number of high profile transactions were abandoned due to economic and regulatory factors nevertheless corporations have continued a trend of deleveraging and are holding significant amounts of cash and many have focused on acquisitions as part of future growth plans private equity funds increased their assets under management during  to a projected  trillion the last period for which data is available as private equity firms as a group enjoyed more success during the year in attracting investment capital first half  results are not yet available but are expected to continue this trend sources bloomberg fortune    during the six months ended june   our net asset value increased from  per share to  per share an increase of  as of june   our common stock is trading at a  discount to our net asset value as compared to  as of december     over the past several years we have executed certain initiatives to enhance liquidity achieve a lower operational cost structure provide more assistance to portfolio companies and realize certain of our portfolio investments specifically we changed the composition of our board of directors and management terminated certain of our followon investments internalized the management of the fund suspended our managed distribution policy modified our investment strategy to pursue shorter term liquidation opportunities pursued noncash investment opportunities and sold certain of our legacy and underperforming investment holdings we believe these actions continue to be necessary to protect capital and liquidity in order to preserve and enhance shareholder value because our management is internalized certain of our expenses should not increase commensurate with an increase in the size of the fund and therefore we expect to achieve efficiencies in our cost structure if we are able to grow the fund   liquidity and capital resources   we generate cash primarily from maturities sales of securities and borrowings as well as capital gains realized upon the sale of portfolio investments we use cash primarily to make additional investments either in new companies or as followon investments in the existing portfolio companies and to pay the dividends to our stockholders   because of the nature and size of the portfolio investments we may periodically borrow funds to make qualifying investments to maintain our tax status as a ric we often borrow such funds by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm there is no assurance that such arrangement will be available in the future if the fund is unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments it may no longer qualify as a ric the fund would then be subject to corporate income tax on its net investment income and realized capital gains and distributions to stockholders would be subject to income tax as ordinary dividends   the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock such as preferred stock subject to certain restrictions net taxable investment income and net taxable realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make followon or new investments   the fund reserves the right to retain net longterm capital gains in excess of net shortterm capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses such retained amounts if any will be taxable to the fund as longterm capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit   we are evaluating the impact of current market conditions on our portfolio company valuations and their ability to provide current income we have followed valuation techniques in a consistent manner however we are cognizant of current market conditions that might affect future valuations of portfolio securities we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine capital expenditures through the next twelve months          table of contents     results of operations     investment income and expense   net investment loss was  million and  million for the three months ended june   and  respectively and  million and  million for the six months ended june   and june   respectively the decrease in net

and qualitative disclosure about market risk   we are subject to financial market risks including changes in interest rates with respect to investments in debt securities and outstanding debt payable as well as changes in marketable equity security prices in the future we may invest in companies outside the united states including in europe and asia which would give rise to exposure to foreign currency value fluctuations we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks the return on investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations   our investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixedrate debt securities since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate changes in interest rates do not directly affect interest income in addition changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the determination of fair value of these debt securities since the securities are generally held to maturity we determine their fair values based on the terms of the relevant debt security and the financial condition of the issuer   a major portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments however significant changes in market equity prices can have a longerterm effect on valuations of private companies which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments a small portion of the investment portfolio could also consist of common stock in publicly traded companies these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities   we are classified as a “nondiversified” investment company under the  act which means we are not limited in the proportion of our assets that may be invested in the securities of a single user the value of one segment called “shipping products and services” includes one portfolio company palletone inc and was  of the net asset value and  of our investments in portfolio company securities at fair value as of june   changes in business or industry trends or in the financial condition results of operations or the market’s assessment of any single portfolio company will affect the net asset value and the market price of our common stock to a greater extent than would be the case if we were a “diversified” company holding numerous investments   item  controls and procedures   the fund maintains disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the fund in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the fund’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow
