ceo and president awards honoree th annual tribute dinner of the jewish institute of religion hebrew union college  banker of the year forbes   banker of the year american banker   address us bancorp us bank plaza  nd avenue south minneapolis minnesota  httpwwwusbancorpcom ■ jerry a grundhofer worked his way up through the banking world to become the president ceo and chairman of us bancorp usb the nations eighthlargest bankholding company over his career grundhofer turned around several faltering banks by adhering to his basic business principles maintaining a salesoriented culture offering highquality customer service and instituting major costcutting measures through acquisitions and mergers he turned star banc corporation of cincinnati first into firstar corporation of milwaukee and then into us bancorp of minneapolis firstar made big news when in february  the company bought usb—run by grundhofers brother john well known as jack—for  billion and took its name although family control of large american banks had become very rare the relationship jerry a grundhofer apwide world photos  between and complementary skills of the grundhofer brothers smoothed the complex integration of these two large corporations followed his brother into banking jerry grundhofer his older brother jack and a sister were raised in a modest home in the los angeles suburb of glendale grundhofers father a bartender and mother who worked as a caterer and maid struggled to put their sons through jesuit schools jerrys first job was parking cars at church jack coached jerry in baseball jerry eventually followed his brother through loyola high school and loyola marymount university and into the world of banking as a management trainee at union bank in los angeles jack found jerry a summer job in the mailroom following his graduation from college jerry grundhofer continued to work at union bank in  he became president of the struggling alliance bank two years later jack grundhofer convinced his employer wells fargo bank to hire his brother as the grundhofer brothers rose through the ranks at wells fargo they adopted the wells way—the costmanagement principles of the companys ceo carl reichardt however whereas jack grundhofer cut costs through layoffs and other draconian measures—earning him the nickname jack the ripper—jerry emphasized the cutting of costs through aggressive salesmanship and employee incentives in  robert smith the chairman and ceo of security pacific corporation in los angeles recruited jerry grundhofer to head the companys retailbanking business over the next three years grundhofer increased the businesss net income from  million to  million and in  he was promoted to president and chief operating officer as security pacific ran into serious problems smith credited grundhofer with keeping earnings up and saving the company from complete disaster in an article in institutional investor jack milligan quoted smith as saying its hard not to follow jerry because he believes so much in what hes doing november  in april  bankamerica corporation announced that it would acquire security pacific grundhofer stayed on until may of  when he was named president ceo and board chairman of star banc corporation of cincinnati turned star banc into firstar grundhofers reputation grew as he turned star banc around with his charismatic optimism richard davis told john engen of usbanker that when grundhofer called to recruit him to star banc he said you know how we always talked about building something from scratch and doing things right this is it—a onceinalifetime chance to put all those best practices in place… theres no better salesperson than jerry february  his first address to the senior managers was both a pep talk and a sharing of his vision for the troubled company grundhofer walked through the building in his shirtsleeves quizzing employees about their latest sales coups and their sales pipelines he became famous for his unorthodox selling strategies telling employees to hand out their business cards in grocerystore lines and sponsoring sales contests between groups of workers—the winners earned las vegas vacations grundhofer transformed star banc into one of the nations most profitable and efficient banks he topped the record pershare operating earnings for  successive quarters and star bancs stock valuation soared grundhofers success enabled him to acquire the struggling firstar corporation of milwaukee in late  with assets of  billion star banc paid  billion in stock for firstar and its  billion in assets grundhofer took the firstar name and moved his companys headquarters to milwaukee known for his effective communication with wall street grundhofer convinced analysts that the move was an inspired one turned firstar around under grundhofer the wells way became the firstar way he continued to follow his philosophy of efficiency and cost cutting while making strategic investments and providing employee incentives he told milligan being a lowcost provider gives one a tremendous strategic advantage it allows you to deal with challenges be competitive on the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet and take care of customers november  whereas many banks were notorious for their high workerturnover rates and lowquality service at firstar grundhofer created an employeemotivating meritocracy bonuses and stock options were based on revenues and customer service grundhofer gave branch managers more authority they became responsible for their own profitandloss statements and were instructed to reward performance by augmenting base salaries by up to  to  percent underperforming managers were fired analysts were stunned when in early  just months after the star banc–firstar merger firstar paid  billion for mercantile bancorp of st louis a regional holding company with  billion in assets grundhofer admitted that he would have liked to have moved more slowly but as with his later acquisitions believed that he couldnt afford to wait firstars earnings continued to rise over grundhofers three years of leadership firstar increased in size eightfold he emphasized lowcost retail products and taught his employees how to sell at his monthly meetings with the heads of the  major business lines grundhofer stressed the principle of operating leverage—the constant pushing of costs below  percent of revenue each firstar business unit was committed to a fivestar service guarantee retail customers would receive  each for an inaccurate statement a tellerline wait of more than five minutes failure to receive a sameday answer to a query lack of access to a telephone representative or a closed or malfunctioning atm grundhofer summed up his approach to management for the business journal–milwaukee  our philosophy is to give customers what they want when they want it and on their own terms also we put the highest priority on increasing the value of our shareholders investment in firstar corporation it is the reason that we come to work each day may   acquired us bancorp in  grundhofer made his boldest move yet in acquiring us bancorp—run by jack grundhofer—for  billion investors worried that grundhofer was moving too fast particularly in light of other recent—and sometimes disastrous—large bank mergers but usb was attractive and affordable jack believed that usb had not been growing fast enough and needed a larger base jerry believed that firstar had to move immediately so as not to lose usb to a competitor after the acquisition firstar took the usb name and moved its headquarters to minneapolis jerry grundhofer became president and ceo of the countrys eighthlargest commercial bank while jack was chairman of the combined board of directors the brothers saw the two companies as a perfect match with firstar providing highquality lowcost retail banking and customer loyalty and usb providing investmentbanking services primarily through its piper jaffray subsidiary in addition usb had access to western consumer markets that were growing at an average of  percent a year—twice the rate of midwestern metropolitan markets usb also had transactionprocessing and commercialpayments businesses offering atm services and corporate credit cards that were growing by  percent annually milligan quoted grundhofer as commenting we know how to compete if we have a distribution system and us bancorp gives us that well combine the values of the heartland with the growth markets of the west this is a story made for fairy tales and history books november  the reunion of the grundhofer brothers made headlines milligan quoted jerry grundhofer as having once said jack and i are pretty similar we think about things the same way we run our companies pretty much the same way november  however although both brothers believed in drastic cost cutting jack acknowledged that jerry not only had more experience with large retailbranch operations but worked within a different model jack decided that jerrys model would be the ideal one for usb the brothers had offices down the hall from each other and made decisions together on a daily basis expanded usb milligan quoted jerry grundhofer as saying we have the mental toughness to win theres no acceptance around here for not making it november  analysts and employees seemed to agree that not only was grundhofer tough but his infectious enthusiasm enabled him to sell his vision effectively while maintaining a longterm perspective grundhofer chose to integrate the two companies over a relatively long period of time so as to minimize disruptions to employees and customers in an address to an american banker conference grundhofer stressed the importance of retailbranch banking brick and mortar is not dead and its not going away the branch office remains the center of the customer relationship february   while cutting costs and eliminating usbs manylayered bureaucracy grundhofer expanded retail services especially in california where just as analysts had predicted usb began buying up retail banks the company opened studentloan autoleasing and homemortgage units it introduced investment and insurance products by the summer of  usb had  branches in california alone and had become the nations largest realestate lender that summer us bank a usb subsidiary undertook a major push into corporate banking in downtown los angeles grundhofer made other acquisitions including leading mortgage company of defiance ohio and nova corporation of atlanta the countrys thirdlargest payment processor grundhofer also spun off piper jaffray management style following jacks retirement at the end of  jerry grundhofer became usbs chairman as well as its president and ceo as of  us bancorp had assets of more than  billion operating nearly  bank offices and  atms in  states the company continued to offer firstars fivestar service guarantee in may  grundhofer announced that he had no plans to make further major acquisitions in addition to bringing firstars branch strategies to usb grundhofer brought its meritocracy annual bonuses for senior managers were tied to performance analysts credited grundhofer with developing one of the best bankmanagement teams in the country in february  grundhofer announced that all employees would be eligible for stock options including parttimers usbs former chief financial officer andy cecere told engen of usbanker  jerry runs this very large company like a small company with a lot of focus and engagement and he works hard to keep things simple the acting cfo david moffett noted there are a lot of ceos who love being ceo more than they love the business thats not the case
