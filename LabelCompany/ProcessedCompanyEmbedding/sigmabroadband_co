never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since becoming incorporated has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets nor has it been involved in any mergers acquisitions or consolidations sigmabroadband co is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in rule a of regulation c of the securities act of  since it has a specific business plan purpose and substantial assets   since our inception we have been engaged in business planning activities including researching the industry identifying target markets for our services and developing our sigmabroadband co models and financial forecasts performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for establishing our offices and identifying future sources of capital   currently sigmabroadband co has officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout

leader in the data network ip telephony and cloudbased services our potential customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities to families living in rural communities we intend to establish a dominant national presence in the tripleplay broadband cable and telecom industry in america   plan of operation   we are a development stage company incorporated on october   and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations however we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months our auditors’ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations the opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than operations our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company   our officers and directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when these controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment          since incorporation the company has financed its operations originally through private capital and then loans from stockholders and executives of the company as of march   we had  cash on hand  we had totaled operating expenses of  which were related to general and administrative costs see “financial statements”   to date the company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan sigmabroadband co is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations     our intended plan of operations is to offer voice data and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue if sigmabroadband co does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next  months the company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern there are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing sigmabroadband co cannot assure any investor that if needed sufficient financing can be obtained or if obtained that it will be on reasonable terms without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety   sigmabroadband co currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business     our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve  months as needed currently the company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time   the company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors  additionally sigmabroadband co believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve months   the company has no plans to seek a business combination with another entity in the foreseeable future   impact of inflation   we believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on us we believe we can absorb most if not all increased noncontrolled operating costs by operating our company in the most efficient manner possible   results of operations   we have generated no significant revenues since inception we have incurred operational expenses for the three months ended march   and  in the amounts of    and  respectively  this decrease of  in operating expenses was primarily the result of onetime professional fees in     general trends and outlook   we believe that our immediate outlook is extremely favorable as we believe the competition is very limited in our market niche for broadband voice data and video in the rural markets and only a limited number of companies competing with us in the marketplace however there is no assurance that such national competitor will not arrive in the future we do not anticipate any major changes in the tripleplay telecommunications industry we believe that  and beyond will be a slow growth years for us we will need to gain strength and stability in the regional rural markets we intend to expand our influence in markets throughout the us          liquidity and capital resources   the financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as per its business plan f or the three months ended march   the company has a net loss of   the company has financed its activities from its stockholder as of march  and
