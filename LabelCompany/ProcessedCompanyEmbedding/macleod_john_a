matthey’s half year presentation results just before we start could i please ask you to turn off mobile phones so we don’t get any interference on the webcast and with that i’ll hand over to robert robert macleod thank you sally and good morning to every one of you today and welcome to our interim results presentation today obviously we’ll follow the normal format but first of all i’d like to express my welcome to anna anna manz who you’ll obviously hear from in a few minutes joined in the middle of this month and my senior management team is hear in the front row to hopefully answer some of your questions later on if i can’t answer them but also hopefully afterwards then if you got any follow up questions please feel free to ask them so without further due just getting into the presentation i’m pleased to report today the trading is in line in the first half in line with our expectations and we have once again confirmed our outlook for the full year sales as you can see we’re up  and underlying profit before tax also up  but earnings per share up  so that’s obviously benefiting partly from the favorable exchange rates as a result of the weaker pound and at constant rates and on a continuing basis sales and operating profit were down a little on last year but overall broadly in line with our plans at ect the first half in europe was especially strong and our asian business also performed well but as expected results were held back a bit by north america because of the cyclical weakness in the class  truck market process technologies held its strong positions and benefited from last year’s cost reductions which have improved return on sales the trading across the division remained pretty tough precious metal products was steady and performance there has stabilized and as i indicated in our q release the timing of business in fine chemicals this year is very much weighted to the second half and so first half performance reflects that but the medium term prospects for the group remains strong and so to reflect this the board has raised the interim dividend by  and of course as you know health and safety is very important to us and remains our priority and as you can see from this chart we made good progress in reducing the number of accidents and incidents across jm the graphs here show our statistics and our stats are moving in the right direction but in this particular area it’s not just about the data and the statistics it’s more about what’s going on in the company and how behaviors and attitudes are changing across our employees and i’m delighted to say it seems to be we’re making traction and real progress and really changing that behavior and that mindset across the group but there is some plateauing in the results as you can see so reinforce is the need for us to keep our focus on health and safety across the group before i move into results just a little bit on our long term strategic priorities and first of all johnson matthey remains very well positioned the three major sectors that i show here all require high technology science based solutions which are valued by our customers and as a result have high barriers to entry automotive as you know is our largest sector almost two thirds of johnson matthey’s sales today and the market today is good even though we’re going through a couple of years whether it’s no new major legislation coming through but there are strong structural drivers ahead and a big opportunity for us quality as you know is a major global issue and johnson matthey has a robust number one position in technology for both emission control and high power lithium iron phosphate battery materials and on battery materials we’re also broadening our portfolio into high energy materials to position us for growth as that market develops jm is also a leader in catalysts and technology for the petrochemical sector about  of our sales today this is as you know a cyclical market which right now is at a low point in the cycle and we’ve taken actions as we talked about last year to reduce our cost accordingly but the medium to long term opportunity is attractive the drive has remained positive consumer demand for fuels plastics and other ma products will drive the need for chemical intermediates which require our catalysts and technologies in order to be economic finally the pharmaceutical sector the smaller part of jm’s business today but attractive market too and bigger in the future driven by an ageing population and the trends towards lower cost healthcare jm is already well placed as a leader in small molecule apis and we’re investing to build a broader api portfolio so we can take advantage of this market opportunity so in summary we’re well placed with strong positions in markets with sound medium term growth drivers and we’re also investing in our business accordingly and driving efficiencies and on that we’re expanding our emission control capacity globally to enable our automotive customers to meet upcoming legislation we’re also continuing to drive efficiency through focus on operational effectiveness and supply chain optimization and you can see that coming through our results in the return on sales in our ect business and as the trend towards electrification continues we’re investing to expand on lithium iron phosphate capacity by  and we announced that today in petrochemicals as i mentioned already we substantially reduced our cost base and reallocated resources accordingly to drive efficiencies but at the same time we’re maintaining our investments in new technologies that way we’ll ensure that we’re in a position to respond when the market starts to recover and that we continue to have a pipeline of new technologies coming to market over the medium term and for the pharma industry we’re investing to expand our capacity in europe and realize opportunities to improve efficiencies across our global manufacturing base and at the same time investing in rd to build our future api portfolio and at the group level our priorities remain to invest in rd and we’re running about  of sales to create the sustainable technologies of tomorrow continue our investment program in our business systems to drive efficiencies and provide scale for the future and we’ll maintain our strong focus on capital efficiency which gives us the capacity to invest for future growth and support longterm value for shareholders so jm is in good shape and our strategy remains robust and with that i’ll hand over to anna to talk you through our first half performance anna anna manz thank you robert and good morning everyone today is the completion of my first month at johnson matthey i joined jm because four things excited me about the company the strong market positions that we have the long history of collaborative relationships with customers the deep and the inquisitive expertise in chemistry and its applications to solve problems and the strong value set which match my own my experience over this first month has been absolutely consistent with these expectations as i enter the business i’ll have three areas which i’ll be focusing on over the coming months to fully understand and get underneath and as you may expect they are resource allocation supported by an understanding of return on investment a focus on working capital to drive cash conversion and a focus on running our business and its processes as efficiently as possible so let me turn to the underlying results as robert said the group delivered solid performance and the results are in line with our expectations you can see that sales grew  asset underlying operating profit and profit before tax however adjusting for translation of foreign exchange which had a significant impact in the period on research chemicals which was disposed out and that completed in september  sales was slightly lower down  and profit before tax was down  the tax charge is fairly steady yearonyear and we expect the tax rate for the full year to be less than  in the period eps is up  by the benefit of foreign currency translation on reported results and by the share consolidation following the special dividends that was paid in february  now let’s look into a bit more detail of what’s driven the group’s underlying profit before tax starting with the impact of foreign exchange this is the translational impact of foreign exchange on the conversion of profits from over subsidiaries into sterling in the half the translation gain is  million on  september exchange rates this will become a  million gain full year the gain at today’s rates would be within a couple of millions of that as a result of our hedging policies there was no material impact or transactional effects in the period the second adjustment is to remove the impact of research chemicals which we sold in september  this business contributed  million of underlying operating profit in the first half of last year prior to its disposal performance against the rebase per year has been steady across four of our divisions ect profits are flat process technologies are down  and precious metal products are up  we’ve also reduced our losses in new businesses taken together with corporate costs these divisions are growing underlying profit before tax the reduction in underlying profit before tax in the first half is fine chemicals where profits of the continuing business have fallen by  now the weak first half in fine chemicals was flecked and it’s predominantly driven by our active pharmaceutical ingredients business the api business is a portfolio of products including new products which are in growth and older products which are maturing and therefore declining and that product mix is continually changing so for example this year we’ve had dofetilide which was launched in june as a growing product and we have mature products such as oxymorphone patent revenue from endo which is within prior but wasn’t in this year now it’s this weak product mix coupled with shipment placing which has contributed to the weak first half but looking forward i’m confident it will be substantially better because we’ll benefit in the second half for a full six months of dofetilide launch and in addition we have another new product which was approved at the end of the first half which we’ll see growth in sales from too and that phrasing will come back the interest charge is reduced slightly compared with prior year this is due to the lower interest charge in relation to the uk postemployment benefits as the uk pension scheme was in surplus at the start of the year it’s offset by higher financial interest due to the transaction exchange on that and greater average levels of net debt through the period now taken together this is a solid performance and it’s in line with our expectations on looking forward we see a stronger second half particularly in fine chemicals and process technologies and therefore our full year guidance is that we would expect our performance to be in line with our expectations so we’ll be delivering slight growth on a continuing constant currency basis full year now turning to cash flow performance in the first half cash flow from operations was  million in the half compared with  million last year however cash flow last year was unusually high with regard to material reduction in working capital in the period of almost  million around three quarters of which was precious metal working capital in the half year cash flow has been impacted by higher levels of working capital this is predominantly due to the buildup of inventory in ect fine chemicals and precious technologies ahead of stronger expected sales in the second half but i’ll get into more detail on the drivers of working capital in my next slide however i do expect our working capital to normalize by the full year looking at working capital in a little more detail working capital has increased  million in the period  million of this increase was in precious metal working capital now precious metal working capital fluctuates according to customer mix as for some customers we procure the precious metal and other customers supply their own consequently this can vary quite significantly at different balance sheet days excluding precious metal working capital days at the th of september are  this compares with  days as of the th of september last year part of this increase is driven by exchange rates our sales are calculated at average and working capital is calculated at closing rates this foreign exchange difference accounts for three days of the increase the remaining increase is due to the buildup of inventory ahead of an increase in sales expected in the second half of the year now the order book is strong for the second half which gives me confidence that our working capital position will be significantly improve by the year end and back within our normal range of  to  days albeit towards the upper end and as i previously said working capital management and cash conversion will be an area of focus for me moving on to net debt our net debt including posttax pension deficits has increased from  million at the yearend to  billion the decline in corporate fund yields has closed the uk pension plan to move from a  million surplus at march to  million deficit as of september this has resulted in the posttax pension deficits increasing by  million now this number is stated net of the corporate bonds which we hold to fund the pension deficit the increase in working capital has impacted net debt by  million now as i previously said i would expect this to partially unwind in the second half despite the increase in net debt the balance sheet remains strong with net debt to ebitda of  times this is well within our target of  to  times and gives us the results that we need to continue to invest in the growth of our business turning to rewards and benefits and starting first with the postretirement medical plan we benefited from a oneoff gain in the first half following the implementation of an inflation cap on our us postretirement medical plan we have therefore recognized a noncash accounting gain of  million in the first half this has been included within the division’s underlying operating profit with the majority of the benefit in ect and precious metals products looking at the group’s other reward schemes there has been an increase of  million in the accounting charge relating to the longterm incentive plan which applies to around  employees this cost is also included in the division’s underlying operating profit and it partially offsets the postretirement medical gain for the full year we would expect an increase of approximately  million in the longterm incentive plan therefore taking the oneoff postretirement medical gain and the increased charge in the longterm incentive together the first half performance benefits by  million and by year end based on current expectations the two will broadly offset now let’s move to look at return on invested capital this was  and broadly in line with last year and well ahead of our pretax cost of capital which is  but it is below our target of  for the group we remain committed to our  target but in the shortterm while the macro environment is challenging for our process technologies business and while our new businesses division had not yet progressed into profitability we’re likely to remain below the target we will continue to invest for the future thoughtfully and have strict investment criteria return on invested capital continues to be a key metric although one of a set of metrics that we will use to assess any project the board of directors has increased the interim dividend by  to  pence so in summary i think this is the solid set of results against a backdrop of challenging marketing conditions it leaves us on the half year exactly where we expected to be and i’m confident that for the full year our continuing business will deliver slight growth on a constant currency basis and i expect working capital performance to improve i will now hand it back to robert who will take you through the performance of the divisions robert macleod thank you anna so as anna just said i will go through each one of the divisions and the performance of those but just to be clear as i go through these i’ll talk  all the numbers i’ll talk about is on a constant currency basis so this is excluding the impact of foreign exchange obviously the numbers in the report it will be on an absolute basis but all my comments tonight will be on a constant currency basis and turning first to ect our largest business which had a solid first half really strong in europe and asia and as expected weaker in north america as a result of lower production of class  trucks sales were up  just over a £ billion and operating profit was flat and the outlook continued to strength  the outlook has continued strength in europe and asia and we expect class  production levels to continue to fall but despite this our north american heavyduty diesel business as a whole should see sales stabilize at current levels and overall we expect ect to continue to perform well i look here the light duty business first here we’ve had a great first half our light duty catalyst business has outpaced the market and our sales were  up versus global light duty production growth of just over  particular strong outperformance in europe as you can see where our sales grew  and that compares to a  growth in the underlying market so why is that well it’s partly driven by the continued benefit from the tail end of euro b coming through and also demand from customers shifting towards more complex high value systems ahead of the introduction of real world driving emission standards in the future it’s interesting to note that despite all the noise going on in the moment the share of diesel costs produced in western europe was stable on last year and we’re also continuing to work with our customers on products for euro c which primarily as you know impacts gasoline costs our business in asia had a solid first half growing to and growing sales by  and that’s been boosted by strong volume growth in china but sales were held back a little bit here as some tax incentives are in place just now which favor smaller costs in north america our sales were down a bit but there is no real change in the competitive position there just a slightly less favorable product mix this year we have more sales of lower value catalysts compared to last year so overall continued focus on emissions around the world and a strong first half from us moving on to our on road heavy duty diesel business and the story here is really strong first half in europe and asia but more than offset by lower sales in north america in europe where sales were up  we’ve benefited from cost of demand from our more complex higher performance technologies including those which we manufacture using our extrusion technology out of our facility in germany which we’re just expanding now in asia very strong growth from indiscernible but will be of course quite a load base and that’s driven primarily by china where we are seeing early benefit from sales of euro  systems as that tightened regulation starts to roll out in some cities and provinces in north america our sales fell in line with the market class  trucks held out pretty well but as expected demand for class  trucks was falling sharply and it has to say more sharply than we had previously expected a peak in september last year and since then production levels have declined but it’s a very cyclical market as you can see here in this data from lmc automotive so whilst we still expect class  production to continue to fall in our second half albeit less sharply than in the first half according to this data they are expected to bottom out in the early part of  ‘ that said as i’ve already mentioned we expect our total north american business on on road hdd sales to stabilize at current levels in the second half as a result of some new business coming through now turning next to process technologies conditions here have continued to be tough as demand in pt’s end markets remained at a low point in that cycle however i’m pleased to say that we’ve retained our strong shares in a challenging environment of low licensing activity and longer catalyst replacement cycles we’ve also benefited from the actions we took last year to reduce our cost base and that’s come through in the increased return on sales the sales fell  and operating profit was only slightly down on outlook although we expect the cycle to remain at current low levels we do anticipate a stronger second half and that’s normal in pt and our order book is strong getting a bit more granular in our chemicals business sales were down as a result of weak demand in both licensing and catalyst demand in both licensing and catalysts our licenses sales declined as demand for new plants utilizing our technologies was weak with limited investment going into the new capacity right now due to a combination of overcapacity in china and pressure on commodity prices this weakness is expected to continue in the second half and we anticipate signing only a couple of small licenses on the same gas side catalysts replacement cycles have been pushed out this particularly impacted our ammonia business where the longer replacement cycle has come from our customers as a result of overcapacity in their end markets in methanol a similar story but as a result of a sustained low oil price here our customers are seeing lower demand from methanol as their end users look to take advantage of cheap oil as an alternative fuel to methanol on the flip side our petrochemical business showed strong first half sales mainly due to demand for zeolite catalysts for use in scr systems our oil and gas business continues to feel the impact on demand of the lower oil price with sales down  and performance is mixed across our business our sale of hydrogen catalysts were weaker as our customers pushed out their refills this was due to lower demand in their end markets as refineries process sweeter crudes which require less hydrogen for desulphurization on the other hand demand for our refinery additives was good and our diagnostic services business continued to see weaker trading as a result of the sustained lower oil price however it did benefit from the reduced cost base and broke even in the first half so turning now to precious metal products which had a steady first half sales slightly down but operating profit higher our manufacturing businesses grew in line with our guidance and has been steady strong positions in more mature markets that they have have been maintained conditions in pgm refining and recycling remain subdued but dont forget it remains a strategic part of the business giving us security of supply for this important raw material for our products overall return on sales has picked up slightly helped by good cost control and we expect steady performance for the rest of the year so looking at precious metal products services predominately the pgm refining and recycling business and thats impacted as you know by lower average metal prices when compared to the first half of last year particularly palladium which is down about  and we saw refining intakes fall sharply last year when the pgm price dropped since then intakes have been steady but albeit at fairly low levels in particular intakes of end of life auto catalysts remain low due in part to low scrap steel prices of course the economics sorry of scrapping all vehicles arent solely dependent on pgm prices and they arent quite as attractive as they used to be and therefore our outlook for intakes remains similar for the remainder of this year we have though opened a new refinery in china which gives us capacity for when scrap autocat volumes come through there but in the meantime well be recycling industrial catalysts so we’ll take some time to fill our capacity and we dont expect a significant impact on the numbers in this year or next however this is a strategic investment for us to position ourselves in this important future market as ive already stated the manufacturing businesses have been steady noble metals had a mixed half with lower demand for pgm catalyst used in the fertilizer industry but other industrial products were ahead and medical device components was stable and finally our agt that’s our advanced glass technologies business is doing well with sales ahead in the first half supported by strong demand from the auto industry in china so moving onto fine chemicals and as we indicated in our quarter one statement fine chemicals’ first half was significantly impacted by product mix and in this case with sales were up by  but profit down  and of course don’t forget that’s for the continuing businesses not just a constant currency but we expect the second half to be stronger we expect a very strong contribution from dofetilide it was approved in june but takes some time to ramp up hence the bigger benefit in the second half we have another product where we’re supplying sub units at relatively low volumes the customers’ product is now been approved so these volumes should pick up in the second half and also on product mix we’ll be selling high quantities of specialty opiates which tend to be at higher margin in the second half and some of these sales have already come through so as anna has already said were optimistic about the second half for fine chemicals in the first half weve already mentioned that weve seen a less favorable product mix for us demand was good for our bulk opiates which are lower margin but in addition as anna has already explained the timing of declining sales for maturing products versus sales from new products means that the phasing of income is more heavily weighted this year to the second half in the us abuse of controlled substances is an area of increasing focus as a result the dea has reduced manufacturing quotas for some substances however the impact on us for the current year is not expected to be material and looking forward its important to remember that much of our investment in our new apis are for noncontrolled substances which are not subject to quotas in cct business has been fairly steady demand for our heterogeneous catalysts was strong from our customers in the farmer and agrichemical sectors which supported our first half sales and our final division new businesses i’m pleased once again with the progress we make  we are making and i expect it to continue battery technologies delivered a small operating profit within that battery materials is doing well maintaining its leading position in lithium iron phosphate where weve just approved an investment of around gbp million to increase our manufacturing capacity by about  and were also continuing to progress the development of high energy nickelrich materials helped by the license agreements we signed with camx power and m and were making progress in our other new business areas too and so the division overall should see a much improved second half so in summary we confirm our guidance once again for  that we gave in june and we are on track to deliver that for our fullyear results and on a constant currency for continuing businesses we expect our performance to be slightly ahead of last year we will also get the benefit of foreign exchange translation if the pound remains at current levels and exchange rates on the  september that equates to a transitional benefit of around gbp million for the full year thats approximately gbp million higher than we expected back in june where we expected the benefit to be about gbp million but in the medium term which is of course more important johnson matthey remains well positioned in attractive markets and if we move forward into our third century we will continue to invest in rd our infrastructure and our people to deliver growth for our shareholders and sustainable technologies that makes the world a cleaner and healthier place so finally before we move on qa i just wanted to give you an update about what were going to do next year for our investor day and were going to do it in september or october next year rather than the usual february time and the reason for that is weve got a lot going on next year as we celebrate our th anniversary so i hope youll forgive us for delaying for six months our presentation to you but well give you the date for our diaries as soon as we can i will let you know about that near the time so with that if you just bear with us a little bit john anna i will get ready for your questions and look forward to hearing from you thank you questionandanswer session a  robert macleod so if i can ask you when you ask your question  i know you bear with me a second if you can give your name and wait for the microphone because this is being recorded and it will help people on the playback to hear the question as well as the answers so if you can say your name and wait for the microphone adam collins good morning adam collins from liberum robert macleod how are you adam collins three if i may so firstly for john you mentioned john you mentioned two positives affecting the strong ect result in the first half tell us that from euro b and the early stage of prefitment benefits as we move towards rde testing i wonder if you could give us a sense of the relative significance of those two factors because of course one of those is going to start to peter out and the other one might start to accelerate so just a sort of sense of how those two might interact in the second half on an ongoing basis robert macleod you want the three questions you want to just go and ask them all and then ask them all or is it just one adam collins as you wish robert macleod go on on your game ph adam collins okay and then on fx a couple of things so anna you mentioned no transaction impacts because of hedging by that do you mean that there is no  that there is derivative hedging in the form of forward options or forwards such that there will be some sort of impact looking forward or you should have hedged some other way that we need to understand so just to understand the transaction sideeffects and then on the calculation  million using your sensitivities i work out for the three currencies its about  so it looks as if there is a rest of the world exposure in addition to dollar yen and euro which makes sense could you just sort of quantify how much that is it looks as if its about  of the exposure thats the second one robert macleod you’re making these long questions aren’t you good guy adam collins yeah but they are important i think that’s it because that was twopart so i’ll leave it at that robert macleod that’s a twopart okay we’ll look ill definitely leave anna to talk about foreign exchange i mean euro b real world driving john can explain it a little more into detail but theres a whole pile of moving parts here and we don’t want to get into great levels of detail because of course i think theres all sorts of moving parts where clearly the drivers for real world driving is a positive for us and no pun intended so if you want to go ladies first you want to go do the fx anna manz yeah sure so transaction fx what i said was there was immaterial impact in the first half and actually the fullyear impact would be very low why is that well the first thing is actually many of our sales are in the same location as where we produce so our underlying transaction exposure is not particularly great but we do have transaction exposure we do hedge it we do hedge it forward so there may be some slight benefit that we will see going into next year on transaction fx but not this year and on the  million well a couple of things the three currencies we give you relates to  of translational fx exposure the second point is its a bit of an oversimplification that we give around the  movement and so the reality when you see such extreme exchange moves is that oversimplification doesnt hold so there is two things going on one using your mechanic for calculating it doesnt quite give you the right answer which is the bigger piece of it and then there is a smaller piece of it which relates to that  of exposure that is not in those three currencies robert macleod and i’m sure you got a good calculator but indiscernible as the rates go down the impact actually gets greater as rates go the other way the impact will be lesser so its not a  its not a linear impact adam collins are you able to tell us what the net foreign currency exposure is the transaction exposure in pounds sterling anna manz sorry adam collins the net foreign currency exposure  the transaction exposure  the foreign currency sales  foreign currency cost anna manz that’s not a number we shared and frankly it moves as you see the sorts of fluctuations in geographic mix that weve seen in the hour robert macleod john do you want to talk a little bit about the balance between the euro b tailing off and the real world driving john walker okay well the new product introduction cycle if you think about that as the whole end to end cycle clearly the euro b stuff is at the end of that cycle and the real world driving is at the front end of that cycle so what were seeing now is for the real world driving impact were seeing a very large increase in numbers of samples and people getting ready for the homologation process to be able to introduce new technologies to be able to improve the nox control under real world driving conditions so there are a lot more samples a lot more activity in the front end of that mpi cycle one thats going to translate into volume is really not next year it’s kind of ‘ ‘ so effectively i kind of see that as accelerating things by kind of six to  months but not really having a huge impact through the end of this year or really into next year it’s really a year or two from now impact robert macleod thank you john next question who went first actually i think neil you had your hand out first last time and then we’ll go to andrew  no we’ll go to martin and we’ll come back to andrew neil tyler thank you it’s neil tyler of redburn a couple of things sticking with ect business in the us john the business there has in terms of its organic or underlying sales growth x currency has over the last two or three years tended to grow less quickly than car production i understand there is mix changes in terms of vehicle mixes that impact that but to what extent is that also a reflection of your customer mix and if at all can you do anything about that thats the first question then on hdd you mentioned robert in your comments some new business that youre anticipating am i right in interpreting that as new platform wins that would deliver some second half growth over and above the market growth thank you robert macleod i think the answer to the second one is an easy one yes and that’s what john has meant ph and the first one john do you want to just talk john walker its also a new technology on existing platforms as well robert macleod yeah so it’s a combination of that would you want to answer the first one of that john walker to the first one on mix is there is again a lot of moving parts in terms of that we have a lot of platform wins and weve had a few platform losses in this particular half of results the platform loss that we had was a high value loss and the platform wins were lower value wins so thats kind of what happened in the first half robert macleod any sort of number  that sort of changes over time and some years you have good years and some years you have less good years and  john walker one of the things that we’re looking forward to i guess is whats going to happen in the light duty diesel pickup truck market in north america and we feel that were strongly positioned there so if truck sales go up for pickup trucks in america were in a pretty good position there with oil prices staying as low as they are robert macleod so that would be a classic  in american systems that’s the low class  trucks that sort of class  and s and sort of pickup trucks john walker suvs and pickup trucks robert macleod okay okay martin do you want to go next martin dunwoodie thanks martin dunwoodie form deutsche bank can i pick up on firstly ect and then battery materials on the ect side you said there is not a lot of material legislation coming over the next couple of years so i guess your sales are probably going to trend more with auto production but what are your customers telling you about production schedules and rates i know you probably only got about three months hardiest visibility but what are they saying next year particularly in the us about wholesale production how do you think that will go and how theyre telling you and then second on battery materials three parts to it firstly i may have misremembered this but the operating result there seems to come a bit earlier the profit seems to come a bit earlier than you had indicated i think you’ve said full year but i might be wrong about that but that seems to be going a bit faster than you maybe thought before secondly option two end licenses on high energy materials what should we look for in future on that you’re clearly focusing very heavily on it now but what should we see in future on this are there more licenses that we should see come in more products that you’re talking about and then the third thing here i know it’s a very quickly meeting area and you indicated the opportunity there do you see this as a bigger opportunity now that maybe you saw even six months ago going forward thanks robert macleod okay john do you want to start off with ect and the wholesale production schedules and what youre hearing john walker okay so the us in particular so us auto production for next year we probably see down a bit and i think we probably have a few cost levers that we still have to apply there to be able to help offset some of that and moving some product around in cheaper manufacturing locations as far as europe goes i mean directionally not very much of a change and we expect to see asia up again then on the heavy duty side even these trucks are going to be light duty comment robert macleod there is a light duty comment there is a light duty question okay on the sort of battery material side i’ll let alan nelson say a few words in a minute but i mean were making good progress in the battery material space and if you remember this is relatively new for us weve only got in it a couple years ago and we are making progress the operating profit for this year and next year will kind of depend upon the level of investment you mentioned of course weve taken these licenses for the high nickel chemistry and it’s the balance between the investments we make versus driving for todays profit now of course the shareholders they want to balance between the two dont they theyre kind of greedy they want both investment for future and delivery in the short run and that never quite happens like that so weve got to try and get that balance right and so on the high nickel so weve got to invest a bit more to make progress there but alan do you want to answer that did you get the three questions alan nelson i think so we’ll give it go and if i don’t hit them all then im sure youll ask them again so you asked a question about the timing for nmc and nca and in particular regards to additional licenses so the two licenses that we signed earlier this year give us broad composition of matter access into both nmc and that was through a license with m and also other high nickel containing materials including nca type of materials and that was the license that came in from camx power so very broadly speaking we have broad composition access to a wide range of high nickel materials we are continuing to look at other technologies that exist out there and looking at additional licensing opportunities that would further enhance that portfolio so yes this is the short answer were continuing to explore different opportunities in that space were also actively looking at developing these materials and bringing these materials to market internally so we’re ramping up our efforts to put pilot scale equipment on the ground and bring these to customers sometime next year and in fact were working with both m and camx power today to bring these materials to our customers to our current customers as i said today you also asked a question is this a bigger opportunity now than we had thought previously and i think really the answer is were just seeing the natural evolution of the power train its important to remember today that most of the battery materials that are produced actually go into consumer electronics and were starting to see increased pickup and traction in the automotive power train and thats where were seeing the increased pull and the increased audience so its not necessarily that were seeing something thats unexpected were just seeing growth in the automotive sector and thats reflected in our investment in lfp and of course the technology licenses that we acquired earlier this year robert macleod thanks alan if you could hand the microphone on to mr stott if you remember here in this lane andrew how are you andrew stott thanks i’m andrew stott of ubs so a couple of questions first is on the process tech i just wondered where specifically youre seeing the order book improvement it looks sizable if i take the working capital comments on board or is that more weighted towards fine chemicals so a couple of questions within process tech and then a second one is more high level im not sure whether you’ve been to trump tower yet and had your consultation but i just wondered if you got some high level thoughts about youre a big player in north america theres lots of issues here that could affect matthey exposure to mexican oems your corporate tax rate infrastructure et cetera i just wonder if you could share any thoughts at this stage on what you see as opportunity robert macleod okay well why dont we do pt first and i think remember the pt is a very lumpy business we said this many times before replacement cycles tend to happen over the summer months so the orders  our catalyst tends to get shift in the spring months march  january february march tends to be our biggest quarter maybe jeff do you want to just talk a little bit briefly about the  maybe you can’t talk briefly can you talk briefly just about where the particular order book youre seeing give me the other mic sorry about the technology john walker it’s okay actually im not sure i’d say a whole lot more than robert said on it when we look at the order book it is pretty much across all the entire portfolio whether its the methanol ammonia same gas range and even some of the things like the hydrogen and even some of our formaldehyde business so we do see pretty strong order book in the second half relative to the first on the catalyst so most of this is catalyst refill so it would be pretty much around the  i wouldn’t say a whole lot any different in the us so in the us yeah in the us middle east where we have good positions china would be the main areas robert macleod thanks jeff and andrew on the sort of working capital point i mean i think its  the orders in days terms and for the group i mean as more of the working capital is in indiscernible because of course the sales are bigger and the quantities of raw materials because it is a greater component in pt but in absolute numbers in terms of days’ terms both of them are pretty high at the moment because of that buildup ahead of the second half i havent been to trump tower and unlike nigel but we did  we are looking at whats the impact of change in the administration in the us and obviously there are lots of potential moving parts its very difficult to assess that today because of course any politician in any country says one thing preelection and then things they are not necessarily the same after the election so well just wait and see exactly what happens there are some things that if they happen could be beneficial for the company and other things that if they happen might be less beneficial so but i think the biggest one is lots of noise around whats going on with epa and the legislation there and our expectations is what is already legislated is unlikely to be reversed i mean so all the  particularly around air quality around the sort of particular matter or nox control and all that stuff its never happened anywhere else in the world ever does that mean it cant happen of course it doesnt mean it cant happen but it seems to us highly unlikely that any politician we go to the country and say were going to reverse air quality improvements rather than  different from making it accelerating further tightening and that may slow down a little but who knows let’s wait and see and on corporate tax rates who knows theyve been talking about changing the tax rate in the us for some time if it happens and it goes down that might be good but might be good because it will depend upon what other reliefs they might offset it because they might miss –they might remove one relief that gives people benefit to reduce the tax rate for others so who knows at this stage its an interesting time that we live in at the moment isn’t it mathew hampshirewaugh thanks it’s mathew hampshirewaugh from credit suisse just another one on ect please and euro c is it correct to assume that for a gdi setup with the particulate filter on that doubles the value of a gasoline catalyst for you and is that roughly sort of  to  is that ballpark and secondly whats behind the  penetration assumption when do you think that comes in robert macleod well the answer to the first question is interesting ph of course you are talking about europe and dollars  dollars in europe but turning into euros and probably thats about right doesnt it john john walker kind of yes yes and yes to the first two parts robert macleod yes to the first two and the assumption on the  i mean that’s  john walker just remember in the beginning the kind of generation one filters some of that filter fitment was uncoated filters as the regulations get tighter and tighter and as we finally get to a point where the particulate legislation is more understood because just remember some of that is still not totally finalized yet you will find that most of the filters on gdi cars will become coated but in the beginning that  whether its  quarteroverquarter it’s still a little bit unclear and again we probably see the real impact of that similar to adams question that hits in terms of volumes really in kind of ‘ ‘ fiscal year ‘ ‘ mathew hampshirewaugh just to clarify thats going to be  of the market will be gdi and that will be full value by  john walker something like  robert macleod  of the gasoline john walker gasoline robert macleod and that’s an estimate so dont hold us to that number if it ends up being  or  i mean look it’s an estimate today well see what happens with the pace of implementation remember real world driving everybody thinks real world driving impacts diesel costs of course it does impact diesel costs but it also impacts gasoline costs too and some of these requirements that john was talking about these filters that need to be fitted john walker it’s a rapidly changing space so robert macleod so because its changing so much its quite hard for us to know exactly what that penetration will be but it feels like that sort of order mathew hampshirewaugh thank you robert macleod adam you would like to follow up but since youre right next door yes you can and the last one youre only hitting one this time aren’t you adam collins i’m going to take three but all to anna so it’s going to be quick so just a couple of things you guided to you guided to higher central cost this year due to improving bonuses profitlinked in bonuses has this got something to do with  indiscernible and what would be your thinking there presumably they go up too if fx is driving profits up and then you also got it to  million higher the fixed asset depreciation this year and next i wondered if you could just update us on your thinking there and then final thing was only erp rollout just an update in terms of the implementation thats going on there robert macleod i’m not sure i should allow all those questions but we really are getting into the minutes right now adam so fine to do but i’m not sure that’s great use to do it around in this table but anyway on the bonus side let’s be clear on bonuses there’s a difference between bonus and ltip ltip is on underlying earnings per share on an absolute basis bonuses we do on constant currency basis so we’re on track to deliver the budget for the year for the group so bonuses will be kind of a little bit better than last year because we missed budget by a little bit but not material the bigger impact is on the ltip side anna manz yeah the central cost increases entirely due to ltip there’s nothing else going on robert macleod so do you want to talk a little bit about fixed asset depreciation which i have to say i’m not sure i could also so i’m hoping you can anna manz maybe will end up taking the detail here off line the erp go live will take place in calendar year ‘ so if was behind your question is will we see an acceleration of depreciation from that in this fiscal the answer is no that will occur next fiscal and otherwise depreciation is unchanged from our previous guidance and in terms of the pay we will do the roll out in calendar  and as we said before it will be a phase roll out over a five year period unidentified analyst indiscernible just on the auto again under rd ph if you see more introductions of the adblue type solution are you a net winner or not out of that john walker net winner yes we’re net winner unidentified analyst what do you supply in that space john walker and adblue what do you mean in adblue robert macleod so we don’t supply adblue adblue is the urea dosing the thing that gets urea we supply scr catalyst we have nothing to do with adblue and making adblue per say but it’s the scr catalyst and as i mentioned there’s move to real well driving is enhancing the complicated catalyst system scr systems principally which are there to control nox john walker we’re net winner solidly improved catalyst systems unidentified analyst indiscernible firstly with the class  truck sales in the us back in june you were talking about gbp million drop in class  this year it’s been probable what do you think it might be in dollar terms now secondly can you just clarify when that expansion to the canadian battery material spend comes on stream and then following your  regarding the  million item that anna talked about is it sort of clarify roughly where the benefit did come i mean you have indicated it might become an ect and pmp but is it possible to just sort of  yeah gbpx million et cetera robert macleod i’m going to answer that question the answer is no we’re not going to get into that level of detail because it’s far too granule and you asked me a question on expansion of the candiac plant that’ll take a couple of years or so  three months before that comes on stream and of course they might go to fill it up and of course we’re building it because we need additional capacity but it’s not going to go from  to  in one week it will build up overtime so wait for a couple of years before that starts to make an impact on the numbers and on the class  trucks john do you want to give a this  million we talked about last time we got together john walker yeah probably closer to  robert macleod pounds or dollars john walker dollars robert macleod okay so i guess gbp was worth a few more dollars back then when we were talking so  is probably not quite as much john walker and most of that’s behind us now as well robert macleod okay any other questions robert macleod well thank you very much indeed for your time thank you very much for coming we find that helpful and we look forward to seeing you again in six months’ time because again we’re not having an investor day in february we’ll do that later on next year so thank you very much everyone copyright policy all transcripts on this site are
