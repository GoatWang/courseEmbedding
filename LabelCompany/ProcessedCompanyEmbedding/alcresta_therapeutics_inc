malabsorption july    am eastern daylight time warren njbusiness wirealcresta therapeutics inc dedicated to developing products designed to address nutritional challenges faced by patients with cystic fibrosis chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cancer gastric cancer and other serious diseases announced that it has received k clearance from the us food  drug administration fda for its relizorb digestive enzyme cartridge for use in pediatric patients suffering from fat malabsorption relizorb was cleared in  for use in patients  years and older this latest clearance will extend the use in children as young as  years old children have a tendency toward reduced metabolic reserves in the form of muscle and fat tissues when compared to adults this is due to the increased energy requirements associated with normal growth and development as a result children are much more susceptible to the effects of poor nutrition especially in medical conditions like cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis in which their ability to convert food into energy as well as into important cellular and tissue building blocks is compromised  relizorb is the only external digestive enzyme therapy designed to mimic the normal pancreatic function of lipase pancreatic lipase is a critical enzyme in the digestion of dietary fats and accounts for as much as  of fat breakdown by the human body the inability to absorb fats leads to problems in gaining or maintaining a healthy weight as well as a deficiency of healthy fats such as omega fats similar to those found in fish oil and fatsoluble vitamins these patients are more likely to suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as stomach pain excess gas stoolrelated problems bloating and nausea they often have to supplement their oral food intake with enteral tube feedings that are administered overnight relizorb® significantly increases fat absorption by breaking down fats found in enteral nutrition formulas leading to an increased availability of critical calories and important healthy fats that may otherwise pass through the body unabsorbed “this clearance represents a significant milestone for children who suffer from fat malabsorption” said daniel tassé chief executive officer of alcresta therapeutics “fda clearance for extending the use of relizorb into the pediatric population is a significant step forward in addressing the nutritional challenges confronting this criticallyill population” data from a recent pivotal clinical study known as the  study supported this clearance the findings were recently published in the july issue of the journal of pediatric gastroenterology  nutrition entitled increased fat absorption from enteral formula through an inline digestive cartridge in patients with cystic fibrosis “the  study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of relizorb use in correcting deficiencies of healthy fats that are often observed in patients receiving enteral nutrition” said eric first md

announced the commercial launch of its relizorb product a firstofitskind digestive enzyme cartridge relizorb is designed to mimic the function of the digestive enzyme lipase to break down fats in enteral tube feeding formula by breaking down fats in enteral tube feeding formulas prior to ingestion relizorb allows for the delivery of absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides for adult patients who are unable to partially or completely break down and absorb fats patients with fat malabsorption due to compromised pancreatic function lack the pancreatic enzymes necessary to properly digest and absorb fats from their diet this has two potential consequences first this limits the caloric and vital nutrient intake and the ability of patients to maintain or gain weight and second the malabsorption of fats can cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms eg steatorrhea flatulence cramps which may affect patient quality of life and adherence with treatment when patients with fat malabsorption such as those with cystic fibrosis or pancreatic or liver disease cannot maintain their weight or develop nutritional deficits they often rely on supplemental nutrition through a gastrostomy tube or gtube to meet their nutritional needs until the fda clearance of relizorb in november of  there had been no approved products available to break down or hydrolyze fats in enteral tube feeding formulas the launch of relizorb will be focused on adults with cystic fibrosis who rely on enteral nutrition approximately  percent of patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption

from the clinical study of relizorb a novel inline digestive enzyme cartridge designed specifically for use by patients receiving enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing fats these results were presented at the th annual meeting of the north american cystic fibrosis conference nacfc in orlando florida this study was conducted in pediatric and adult patients with cystic fibrosis cf and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency epi receiving enteral feeding the absorption of fat was calculated by assessing changes in plasma concentrations over  hours of physiologically relevant longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids lcpufas such as omega fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa dha and epa are not only sources of energy but are also essential components of cell membranes and are integral in maintaining normal development and overall health relizorb use compared with administration through placebo resulted in a statistically significant  fold improvement p in total dha and epa absorption the study also found that relizorb use during the administration of enteral nutrition across both pediatric and adult patients with cf and epi was found to be safe and well tolerated there was a decrease in the frequency and severity of gi symptoms particularly stoolrelated symptoms associated with fat malabsorption importantly more
