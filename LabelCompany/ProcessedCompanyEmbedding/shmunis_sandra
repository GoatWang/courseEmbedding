“we’re big believers in helping those who are helping themselves” says sandra “and we wanted to invest in a program that is already well established so that we didn’t need to reinvent the wheel in addition we have a great deal of respect for jfcs—it’s one of the toprun organizations in the bay area—and we believe in supporting the jewish community” originally from odessa vlad and sandra are grateful for jfcs and other jewish family service organizations that helped bring them their parents grandparents and other close relatives and friends to the united states from the former soviet union they hope that their gift to jfcs’ small business and professional loan program will reap dividends in a number of ways inspiring others in the community to contribute to it and seeing the businesses that are helped grow and fuel our local economy by hiring more workers “we are deeply grateful to vlad and sandra and their family for their support of the jewish community this vital program is inspiring bright young people to be successful and give back the way the shmunis family is” says dr anita friedman jfcs’ executive director “at the same time the shmunis’ gift is also
