of  our products have sold in over  stores including our method is  confidential and secure oil  gas investment fraud scams  lawsuits attorneys oil  gas investment scams with the drop in oil prices in  and  thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few

have come down to mmrealized price are higher than the wti spot priceaggressive hedging strategy  of production will minimize liquidity risks in pegff needs a brent price of under bbl to run out of cashfrom now on with bankruptcy out the question any news will be good newsi wrote an article on march  about pacific rubiales energy corp otcpegff and promised to deliver an update after todays release of the annual report here is the update on the pegff the article will be divided in five segments the analysis of the march th model the debt profile of the company the realized price of oil and the sales for the year and finally the cash on hand at the end of  according to the oil price get a good cup of coffee this is a wild ride model analysis let me compare my model form my last article to the latest annual report source fourth quarter  year end  results  consolidated financial statements indeed according to the year end results there was b of cash spent on capex instead of b listed in the march presentation march  slide  furthermore the sale of the pipeline asset was not completed in the fourth quarter and there is still mm to be received in the first quarter of  in summary the model was doing fine as the magnitude of errors are close to  debt profile according to the conference call this morning q  full year  conference call slide  there is no debt repayment until the fourth quarter of  on the other hand the credit facility the last line of defense as management calls it is fully drawn the defense is already down according to latest financial statements financing costs were mm in  the debt listed as other in the statements was repaid with the b credit facility as said earlier thus we can subtract mm from the financing costs which gives us financing costs of mm for the year finally i add the cost of the credit facility libor plus  the current  week high libor rate in usd is  according to the wsj i will say the credit facility will bear interests of  a year or mm a year we can see that the decision to take the money from the credit facility was justified in summary the total financing costs for the year  is estimated at mm with no debt maturing before the fourth quarter of  realized price of oil and  sales how much money can pegff receive for each of its barrel of oil with the hedging policy in place and price differentials between the wti and the brent spot price this is a tough question to answer although the march presentation told us the hedging would affect up to  of production march  slide  we learned this morning that it would affect about  of production according to the presentation of this morning conference call the net production is already at mboed yeartodate compared to a  net average production of mboed the estimated net production for this year of mboed is at the center of the guidance given by the management team it will be used to estimate sales throughout the year here are the barrels of oil equivalent produced for each quarters by pegff with a stable net production the other important question to answer is where pegff can sell its oil if it goes to the us the pricing will be lower because of the lower wti versus brent price consequently the price of oil will be higher anywhere else around the world because of the brent price according to the presentation of this morning we learned on slide  that the price realized yeartodate was around boe in that period according to the eia eia wti spot price eia brent spot price the average brent price was bbl and the average wti price was bbl therefore the realized price per barrel of oil produced from pegff is  lower than the brent price and  higher than the wti price there are mmbbl hedged based on the wti price and mmbbl hedged based on the brent price against a total net production of mmboe we learned from the presentation this morning slide  that for the full year of   of the oil produced was sold to the us therefore this brings us to the first hypothesis of this article hypothesis  of the net production will be sold to the us at the wti spot price or the floor price of the wti hedging in place the rest of the net production  will be sold at the brent spot price minus  or the floor price of the brent hedging in place source q  full year  conference call slide  it is estimated that the oil sales with hedging in place will bring in mm for pegff in line with our hypothesis there will be around mmboe for sale in the us in the third quarter and mmboe for nonus sale throughout the year in summary the variables for the sales this year will be the wti spot price in the third quarter and the brent spot price throughout the year cash on hand at the end of  the cash that pegff will have at the end of the year will be computed according to the wti spot price in the third quarter july to september and the brent price throughout the year source q  full year  conference call slide  this process is repeated at intervals of bbl the wti price in the third quarter of bbl will not be changed during this analysis as there is a very small amount of nonhedged volume mmboe of oil for sale in the us therefore as the wti spot price is not significant anymore the investor should focus on the pricing of brent remember that this is the change in cash during the year  thus with pegff starting with over mm in cash according to the latest financial statement the average brent spot price throughout the year would need to fall under bbl for pegff to be in real trouble outlook and conclusion the article i wrote on march  was portraying a darker picture of pegff there is one component changing this perception production hedging the aggressive hedging of about  of net production implemented by the management team for the year is a true game changer this strategy will surely be of a huge help to ride the bearish oil market this year with the use of the credit facility cash available at the end of  of over mm and the announcement of an asset sale of m which is a fair price according to the last sale of  working interest pegff has in my opinion absolutely no chance of going bankrupt however this analysis include aggressive cost cutting including lowering the production costs of  the transportation costs of  the diluent costs of  and the general and administrative costs of  i wont advise to go short on this stock from now on any news will be good news in summary the main risks for this company are brent pricing throughout the year realization of aggressive cost cutting nonetheless i decide to put my money where my mouth is i will advise to take a very small position in this stock then if the brent pricing becomes more favorable to the oil producers and if the cost cutting measures become a reality i would add more disclosure the author is long pegff the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their own opinions the author is not receiving

confidential and secure oil  gas investment fraud scams  lawsuits attorneys oil  gas investment scams with the drop in oil prices in  and  thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we are
