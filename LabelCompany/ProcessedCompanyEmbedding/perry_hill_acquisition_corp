statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these

unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all

the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september        perry hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments recent accounting
