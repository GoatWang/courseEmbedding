this daily in both my personal and professional life headquarters mclean virginia annual revenues  billion employees  nazzic keene • saic president enterprise information technology sector  award winner sep    technology   comment much of my leadership style and who i am today can be attributed to the values instilled in me by my mother she raised three children on her own working fulltime and raising three strongwilled daughters with her as my role model i learned very early in life the value of independence resourcefulness and how to embrace change as my career and my leadership style have evolved i’ve tried to live and work by one simple principle do what you say and say what you do it’s simple but powerful it demonstrates a sense of transparency and ethics that is important to me personally and professionally by staying true to your beliefs the organization will always be a better place for it this will ultimately create an environment of trust and collaboration throughout all levels of a team through it all i’ve also learned that it is important to be myself i decided early on that my success would be based on my own style hard work and merits and originality it is important as a leader to know who you are and appreciate and leverage your strengths but it is just as important to recognize those areas in which your colleagues can help you become a better leader for those starting out in their careers it’s important to find your own style learn how it best fits in with the organization and always be true to yourself first and foremost i am a mom and like many working moms and dads i have been faced with the challenge of balancing work and home i am so proud of the young adults my children have become and i hope that i have been and will continue to be the positive role model to them as my mother has been for me much of my time outside of work however little that is is spent traveling or simply enjoying our home with my husband i live to enjoy every day how has education affected your career i knew in order to succeed i needed an education and i did whatever was necessary to achieve that goal juggling my studies and various fulltime jobs to receive that degree what does it take to succeed and stay competitive in your positionfield surrounding yourself with a diverse team with different talents strengths and ways of solving issues creates a
