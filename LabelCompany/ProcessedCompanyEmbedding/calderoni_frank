regular medium large google print cisco cfo frank calderoni making customers the center of strategy for cfos looking to become more involved in strategy a good place to start is through customer interactions and adjusting their view longterm according to frank calderoni evp and cfo of cisco systems inc mr calderoni also discusses how value can be created through the actions of the finance team in a conversation with kirsten rhodes who serves several fortune  technology and media companies as a director strategic clients with deloitte services lp mr calderoni who has been with cisco for  years will be leaving cisco at the end of the year to pursue other opportunities kirsten rhodes for cfos who want to play a stronger role in strategy setting what should they be considering frank calderoni frank calderoni it’s important to have the right intelligence on customers and the markets and know how to work with business partners to meet changing requirements at cisco all executives are required to be a sponsor of multiple customers to understand their needs and requirements over a longer period of time another way we connect with customers is through cio forums which provide an opportunity to understand what customers are buying and expect to be doing in the longerterm those connection points with customers give us insight when we’re considering portfolio investments and they can be important in understanding our longterm strategy second to be a part of strategysetting cfos have to be more longterm focused it’s important to have a framework to focus on the long term with data that can help you look at how things could play out for the industry as well as for the company when taking a longterm strategic view cfos also need to understand what tradeoffs might be needed analytics can play an important role because they can provide the intelligence into where the customer is going and where the opportunities for the business will be and help support decisions based on those tradeoffs third cfos need to be relevant to the business partners and understand the business you can have the greatest data and the most incredible analysis but it won’t be heard unless you put the analysis in a business context so that the business partner connects with the information you’re sharing and you have to take time to connect with your business partners and develop relationships in order to gain their trust confidence and respect finally work to have constant engagement with the business partners be a part of decisions when needed and be very forthright with your opinion kirsten rhodes what are some ways cfos can help improve their contributions to value creation frank calderoni one of the more important steps is managing working capital as efficiently as possible this way the organization has the flexibility to make the kind of investments that will contribute to future value and make the most of current investments if there’s a part of the portfolio that is not creating value that should lead finance to question whether to continue thin out or discontinue sometimes cfos have that broader perspective to take an outsidein view which can allow them to be a bit more critical in a positive and a necessary way for the business long term the cfo can serve as a catalyst to challenge business partners ask questions that can help them step back and look at an issue from a different perspective sometimes the questions are not always the ones a business partner is looking for but if you have the right relationship it can help spark a healthy discussion about the strategy and whether it is aligned with what the investors are looking for in terms of creating value when there is a limited amount of funding the cfo can help steer the organization to the opportunities that will bring the most value creation for example at cisco we’ve been focusing not just on top line growth but also on overall profitability with total shareholder return in mind kirsten rhodes how has cisco’s approach to driving working capital performance adapted to changes in strategy and its focus on customers frank calderoni we’ve taken steps on both the accounts receivable and procurement side with respect to our supply chain we have a lean program that allows our suppliers to hold inventory and have inventory ready when we need it so we can pull it into the supply chain this approach makes it much more efficient and effective in getting product to customers in a timely way and it is a more streamlined process to manage on the procurement side we try to ensure that we have reasonable payment terms so that we can leverage the right types of asset efficiency we look at the various elements that could impact the efficiency of our working capital and have metrics associated with each to continue to improve working capital performance the process also enables us to better monitor availability of cash and determine where to invest it it goes back to the three priorities of investing the cash for shareholder return investing the cash to make investments organically and then investing the cash for acquisitions all of which should align to value creation kirsten rhodes what can cfos do to help ensure that they have the funding properly aligned for major initiatives frank calderoni the first thing is making sure the right analysis has been done from a strategic standpoint—is the initiative the right fit and is the opportunity for value creation really there if so the second issue to consider is what offset might be needed and how to fund it chances are funding will need to be displaced from somewhere else so the finance team has to be able to offer suggestions including finding efficiencies doing things smarter and being more productive the third part is to have a plan that allows you to be successful so you’re not starting something and finding out part of the way through that you can’t meet your objectives the plan should be a financial plan as well as a business plan so that you can monitor your progress along the way to ensure that the initiative is getting the right attention to meet the planned roi kirsten rhodes given cfos’ broadening roles how can they find time to participate in strategysetting frank calderoni i think it comes back to making time by setting priorities managing one’s time very closely and delegating as a cfo you can always be extremely busy with fiduciary and financial responsibilities because those are endless just as the organization overall has to balance time spent on strategy versus operational or tactical matters so does the cfo second in order to find the balance and the time for strategy cfos need to look at how they leverage their team to focus on the fiduciary or accounting side it comes down to balancing time and making sure that you have the right talent to free up some time for strategy editor’s note this article is part of an ongoing series of interviews

related deloitte insights execution risk stepping over  common hurdles whether an incoming cfo is charged with improving performance or a sitting finance chief is trying to transform the organization execution risk looms large consider for example the risks involved in changing an organization’s business model expanding globally or even in getting projects that are off the rails back on track there are three primary drivers of execution risk—availability of critical resources stakeholder commitment and alignment and emotionalsocial resistance—and solving for them begins by understanding their root causes learn  issues leaders should consider addressing to help deliver successful change initiatives building strong relationships with segment ceos charles holley cfoinresidence having a strong relationship with business segment leaders is an important element to being the kind of cfo that ceos look for to help them drive their vision and execute the organization’s strategy according to charles holley retired cfo of walmart mr holley discusses how finance chiefs can establish that strong relationship by becoming a trusted business partner to segment ceos developing an ability to be an adept influencer to guide decisions for both their segments and the enterprise and by serving as the ceo’s enforcer when necessary sysco cfo joel grade connecting finance to customers and the business sysco corp cfo joel grade has held a variety of positions during his year tenure including stints as president of sysco canada and as a regional senior vice president of foodservice operations those experiences he says have shaped his rollupyoursleeves view of finance and inform his views on how finance can help drive the company’s growth in this conversation with tom bendert principal with deloitte consulting llp mr grade discusses how finance supports productivity initiatives ma customer engagement and other elements of sysco’s growth strategy views  analysis four ways cfos can avoid a digital talent crunch technology is redefining how work gets done both in the back office and in frontline operations while the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance it also creates the potential for a digital divide if members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities learn how cfos can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership culture skills development and engagement keeping finance talent relevant to changing needs charles holley cfoinresidence it’s no secret that talent is key to a cfo’s success yet talent is a perennial top challenge for cfos that’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team says charles holley an independent senior advisor to deloitte drawing on his extensive leadership experiences he explains how to identify recruit and develop the people best suited for the fastchanging demands of finance the key he says is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business fpa why talent counts and what cfos can do to improve it to elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s fpa team can make cfos should focus on developing the team’s technical professional and leadership competencies specifically they can use a fourpart model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decisionmakers and the expectation that fpa will function more strategically rotating talent from fpa into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success editors choice leading business transformation at the speed of tech kelly kramer cisco cfo
