dividend investing  print article i previously wrote an article about measuring and managing dividend stocks but have you ever wondered how to build a dividend portfolio in the first place   like most things with investing everyone has their own opinion about how to construct a portfolio most of the debate usually centers on how many holdings an investor should own and how their holdings should be diversified   while there is no right or wrong answer i believe there are general guidelines that investors should remain aware of to avoid taking unnecessary risk with their dividend portfolios – especially for those living off dividends in retirement   in this article i will review the key factors that influence a portfolio’s risk profile let’s start with a basic understanding of why a portfolio is important in the first place   a portfolio diversifies risk why should investors build a dividend portfolio instead of investing completely in one or two companies that they really like   for one thing investing involves a tremendous amount of randomness and luck even the “best” professionals are wrong at least  of the time   if we invested all of our cash into a single company even one with seemingly “low” risk we will likely generate returns that are significantly different than the market’s performance – for better or worse   many investors do not have the stomach for this level of volatility especially since there are a number of unexpected events that could occur to put your capital at risk of being permanently lost   remember enron what about lehman brothers going “allin” on any one company can have disastrous consequences   on the other end of the spectrum suppose you bought shares of every stock in the market for every company in your portfolio that experienced bad news you would likely own just as many businesses experiencing unexpectedly good news   in other words you would no longer be dependent on any single stock to drive your investment returns and dividend income your portfolio could weather a few unanticipated storms because it was diversified across a number of different companies   so long as our country continues to survive and advance there would be virtually no chance of your portfolio experiencing a permanent loss of capital – the market has historically appreciated over long periods of time and will likely continue to do so   it’s obviously impractical for an individual investor to buy shares of every company in the market without the use of exchange traded funds etfs but you can understand the advantages of owning more than just a couple of companies   properly constructed portfolios can help us diversify away risk and get closer to our objectives building a dividend portfolio starts with an understanding of the main risk factors that influence a portfolio’s returns and volatility   key risk factors to consider in my opinion the four most important factors that will influence the volatility of your portfolio’s return relative to the market’s return are  the number of holdings  the correlation between holdings  the amount of financial leverage each holding has and  the market cap size of each holding   each of these risk factors can significantly impact a portfolio’s performance especially during turbulent markets   investors are often unaware that they are making a factor bet with their portfolios until it works against them   for example suppose half of your portfolio was invested in small cap energy stocks with high financial leverage   until late  your portfolio probably enjoyed excellent returns and low volatility as oil prices and production increased   it’s only human nature to attribute good results to our own skill rather than luck however this portfolio was nothing more than a factor bet on energy and favorable credit markets   now that the price of oil has collapsed and credit is less available to small energy firms this portfolio would have been walloped   the point of building a portfolio is to diversify away these factor bets which we cannot control or forecast and focus our returns on the performance of individual companies   risk factor  how many stocks should i own many of the best investment professionals run concentrated portfolios eg top  stocks   of the portfolio’s value they invest with conviction behind their best ideas   for example warren buffett’s dividend portfolio has several holdings that exceed  of his portfolio’s overall value   as an individual investor i certainly do not have warren buffett’s resources connections and insights needed to responsibly run a concentrated portfolio   for that reason i prefer to spread my bets over a reasonable range of different stocks to avoid shooting myself in the foot with a concentrated bet that turns sour   the fewer stocks you own the greater your portfolio can deviate from the market’s return so how many dividendpaying stocks should you own to maximize the benefits of diversification plenty of academic studies have tried answering this question over the last  years   the american association of individual investors “aaii” wrote an article citing that “holding a single stock rather than a perfectly diversified portfolio increases annual volatility by roughly …thus the singlestock investor will experience annual returns that average a whopping  above or below the market – with some years closer to the market and some years further from the market”   the aaii study went on to state that as a rule of thumb diversifiable risk will be reduced by the following amounts holding  stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about  holding  stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about  holding  stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about  a more recent study was released in late  in a paper titled “equity portfolio diversification how many stocks are enough evidence from five developed markets”   notable findings were that a greater number of stocks are needed to diversify risk during periods when markets are in financial distress – correlations between stocks are often the highest in this type of environment   within the us the researchers concluded that to be confident of reducing  of the diversifiable risk  of the time the number of stocks needed on average is about  in times of distress however it can increase to more than  stocks   from these two studies alone it would seem responsible to own between  and  stocks however in addition to the math behind diversification investors should also consider factors unique to their personal financial situation – the size of their portfolio willingness to devote time to research trading costs and more   the smaller your portfolio the greater the impact trading costs will have on total returns investors with small accounts should consider buying dividend etfs instead of individual stocks to save trading costs and achieve diversification   the more positions you own the less research time you will have to devote to knowing your companies really well   while it is highly subjective i believe the relationships between portfolio value and the number of holdings in the table below provide a reasonable balance between the need for diversification a desire to keep trading costs low and a limited amount of research time to devote to maintaining a portfolio   source simply safe dividends   at the end of the day each investor has a unique opinion on how much diversification is “enough” and how much risk they are willing to take   once i have settled on an ideal number of holdings to own i prefer to equally weight my positions it is very difficult to know which stocks will go on to be the best longterm performers   risk factor  industry diversification while owning a greater number of stocks can provide diversification benefits many investors still end up with poorly diversified portfolios because they are drawn to particular types of stocks eg consumer products with familiar brands or investing “rules” eg only buy stocks with pricetoearnings ratios less than x   unfortunately owning a number of stocks that have similar characteristics does not provide adequate diversification   this is because stocks from similar industries are often sensitive to the same factors and move together in the market ie they are highly correlated   if a shared factor such as interest rates or the price of oil becomes unfavorable your portfolio could significantly underperform the market   picking stocks from different sectors and industries helps diversify away this risk because when some sectors are struggling others are likely doing well   the pie chart below shows the sector breakdown of the sp  you can see that only one sector accounts for more than  of the overall market information technology   my personal preference is to invest no more than  of my portfolio into any single sector and i try to own bluechip dividend stocks with little overlap in their actual operations   source sp   sector diversification is important because you never know which areas of the market could come in or out of favor   as seen below a portfolio invested completely in energy stocks would have returned  over the last five years underperforming the sp  by    on the other hand a portfolio consisting completely of healthcare stocks would have gained  beating the market by    no one knows which sectors will be the best and worst performers over the next five years which is why maintaining a reasonable level of diversification is important   source simply safe dividends   importantly sector diversification should not come at the expense of violating valuation principles or extending outside of your circle of competence   just because consumer staples accounts for  of the sp  doesn’t mean you must buy a stock in that sector if you cannot find one that is attractively priced   equally important you should not diversify into a sector or industry that is outside of your comfort zone   for example many conservative dividend investors remain underweight the technology sector because its pace of change is too fast trying to predict which tech companies will still be relevant in five years can be challenging   the takeaway is that you should be intentional with your diversification across sectors and business models but you don’t need to play everywhere stick to areas of the market you are comfortable with and use common sense as you look to diversify get dividend stock ideas and research tips each week   risk factor  financial leverage financial leverage magnifies returns received by equity holders and is one of the key factors to be aware of when searching for safe stocks the more debt a company has the more the price of the stock can fluctuate depending on business conditions   as such companies with large debt loads and more cyclical business models usually have more volatile stocks   if interest rates ever rise and credit conditions start to tighten some of the lower quality highly levered firms could run into trouble   when constructing a portfolio it’s important to be aware of the overall credit quality of your holdings   for most types of businesses i prefer to see a debt to capital ratio of no more than  healthy free cash flow generation and strong coverage ratios eg net debt  ebit of less than x these are some of the most important financial ratios to understand   risk factor  size matters historically speaking companies with small market caps have exhibited greater stock price volatility than large cap stocks   the bigger the company the more buyers and sells there are to trade shares back and forth the availability of buyers and sellers is known as liquidity   when you enter an order to buy or sell shares of cocacola someone has to be on the other side of the trade and agree to your asking price for the trade to execute   small cap companies ie stocks with market caps under  billion can have much less liquidity compared to large cap companies   with fewer buyers and sellers it is not always as easy to move in and out of positions and the spread between the price that a seller is asking for and the price a buyer is willing to pay can become very wide   with less trading liquidity small cap stocks can significantly outperform or underperform large cap stocks in different market environments   small cap stocks are also more volatile because their businesses are often less diversified and established than large caps   as seen below the russell  which contains mostly small cap stocks exhibited significantly greater volatility standard deviation over the past decade than the dow jones and sp    expect your portfolio to also demonstrate greater volatility if it is mostly composed of small cap stocks   source simply safe dividends   price volatility and time horizon in addition to the four risk factors mentioned above investors should understand beta price volatility and take advantage of their longterm holding periods to improve their dividend portfolios   beta measures a stock’s price volatility in relation to the market by definition the market has a beta of  and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market   a stock that swings more than the market over time has a beta above  if a stock moves less than the market the stock’s beta is less than    a stock’s beta is largely determined by some the risk factors mentioned above smaller companies with high amounts of financial leverage and less predictable business models will usually have higher betas   while beta is backwardslooking ie a stock with low price volatility historically will not necessarily have low volatility going forward it is still helpful for investors to understand since we each have different risk tolerances and emotional tendencies   a portfolio filled with stocks that have beta values greater than  will likely whip up and down much more than a portfolio filled with low beta stocks   importantly beta is based on relatively nearterm price volatility ignores underlying business fundamentals   in other words for longterm focused dividend investors a high or low beta does not indicate whether or not an investment will be successful over the next five years   as individual investors one of our biggest advantages is being able to hold stocks for much longer periods of time to let their strong underlying fundamentals eventually be reflected in the stock’s price   as you build up your portfolio remember you are running a marathon not a sprint   it is generally better to own shares of a quality growing business trading at a reasonable price than remain on the sidelines trying to time the market or play the quarterly earnings game let your long time horizon work for you     closing remarks building a dividend portfolio is part art part science constructing an optimal portfolio largely depends on an individual’s goals risk tolerance and available capital   when it comes to dividend investing building and protecting a nest egg is goal number one followed by generating a stream of safe growing passive income   understanding the key risk factors influencing a portfolio’s returns and volatility can help us avoid taking unnecessary risk   the following risk factors are worth remembering the greater number of uncorrelated stocks you own the less diversifiable risk remains depending on portfolio size and research time constraints owning  to  stocks seems reasonable for most investors stocks should be diversified across different sectors and industries small cap stocks are more volatile than large cap stocks stocks with high financial leverage are more volatile and create greater risk for shareholders a stock’s beta tells you how volatile the stock has been relative to the market investing with a time horizon measured in months or quarters is speculating keeping the above factors in mind you should review your personal goals are you nearing retirement and looking to create a safe and steady stream of income to live off of   are you investing for your grandkids looking for more balance between income and longterm capital appreciation   what is your risk tolerance how much time are you willing to commit to stay current with your portfolio   answering all of these questions will influence how many dividend stocks you choose to buy and the characteristics of each stock eg dividend yield price volatility dividend safety scores   for investors interested in reviewing the

brian–this is a great article especially as several have mentioned the reduction of risk with numbers of stock owned i wonder if anyone has then couple this with sector diversification to refine the number i realize sectors go in and out of favor sometimes as you mentioned without much warning but sector diversification must have an effect on risk just wondering joe simply safe dividends july   at  pm  reply hi joe thanks for your comment and i’m happy to hear that you liked the article sector diversification definitely impacts risk but in my view it’s not worth being overly scientific about either perfectly trying to match up one’s sector exposure with the broader market can actually lead to more trouble than good in some instances eg the tech sector was  of the market in  before it crashed financials were more than  of the market in  my preference is to build up a portfolio one stock at a time based on business quality and valuation from there i try to keep a reasonable balance between sectors eg no sector greater than  of my portfolio but am mostly focused on owning the best companies possible for the long term brian hank november   at  pm  reply i really liked your article currently i have a portfolio that is heavily focused on commodities to speed up my returns one single stock adm makes up about  of my portfolio this is to make sure that i get additional stocks every quarter compounding interest is the th world wonder according to someone who knew his stuff so that’s why i choose to buy so much of a single stock simply safe dividends december   at  pm  reply hi hank you certainly have more of a stomach for risk than me with great return prospects comes great risk in most cases as long as you are aware of the risks and are willing to accept them i wish you the best of luck here is my research on adm from november  httpwwwsimplysafedividendscomarcherdanielsmidlandadmadividendaristocratyielding brian shirley a gourlay november   at  am  reply i learned my lesson going heavy in energy it was great for awhile now i have a bunch of pipelines that were not supposed to follow the commodity price down but did i also bought up stream companies never again i had about  in energy ouch if i put  of my total portfolio in each company now not energy at what point should i consider taking some off the top hank seems comfortable with  in one company i would not be what percentage would you say is too much in one company when i talk about total portfolio i”m including my bonds am i wrong doing that simply safe dividends december   at  pm  reply hi shirley everyone has a different opinion on proper diversification it begins with overall asset allocation between bonds and stocks perhaps that is most important than within each asset class an investor needs to figure out what level of return and risk is appropriate for his or her goals it’s important to be aware of your total portfolio’s diversification bonds and stocks morningstar has an xray tool that helps you bring in everything most studies show owning  individual stocks diversified across different industries captures the bulk of benefits from diversification my preference is to equal weight each position because it’s hard to know which investments will go on to be the best performers my approach means that each position is between  and  of my stock portfolio’s total value depending on how many total stocks i decide to own the more stocks you hold the more closely your portfolio will likely match the broader market assuming reasonable diversification between companies

fob thank you for welcoming me to the community you raise a very valid point i will see if i can look at the tracking errors and index efficiency early next year thank you for stopping by likelike reply both of you teamcf as well as divnomics got me thinking that is why i love this blog already even though i do not write on it for long yet so what i did was actually make a list of the management fees that i am charged in my portfolio the result of which will be an individual blog entry in a short while but what i can say already is that i thought i knew what the individual fee percentages were however i was actually quite surprised and while i do not like doing a lot of transaction i already sold one position due to the fees i was charged likelike reply looking good like team cf i think it’s a really interesting approach and to see how your journey will play out 🙂 just curious you are not having any transactions costs on buying the funds or are they that much lower compared to buying individual stocks likelike reply thank you for your comment divnomics unfortunately my transaction costs are not that much lower however if i wanted to be invested in say  companies i would have to pay at least eur  in transaction costs the minimum fee i pay at my broker is eur  so it is more a diversification argument why i do this likelike reply totally understandable and looking forward to your updates ps you might want to check this 🙂 httpcheesyfinancenlwpindexphpfiredupmeetingtake likelike interesting investment strategy using only dividend etf you don’t see this very often but i certainly understand the appeal are you also considering branching out into individual stocks major benefit is the reductionelimination of management fees but it does take more time to build a balanced dividend portfolio curious to know your thoughts likelike reply thank you very much for your comment at the moment i have no intention to invest in the equity of individual companies the management fees of mostfunds etfs you see above are below  or even  on annual basis this comes down to about ca eur  for my entire portfolio if i would like to achieve the same level of diversification via individual transactions i would have to spend much more in trading costs as the portfolio grows i might revisit this however likelike reply agreed upfront costs are a bit higher but in the long term it really quickly changes just something to consider for the  years calculations 😉 likelike leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click

in  with the gfc since then i trade the market in the penny dreadful end looking for  returns on the whole i do pretty well but i have had some spectacular failures reply link retirebyforty january    pm i don’t have the gut to deal with penny stocks whenever i tired i ended up losing money reply link dividend growth investor january    pm i always get ads to trade penny stocks and turn  into  haha on a more serious note i am glad that you are planning on selling off some intc t and rdsb these three stocks generate  of your total dividend income for safety i actually own more than  individual stocks in my dividend portfolio if one of them cuts or eliminated dividends i won’t be too terribly affected and can redeploy funds elsewhere the only people on the internet who advise “concentrated” portfolios with  stocks are those who are not dealing with real money if you are serious about this income stream you need at least  individual stocks representative of as many sectors that make sense and if you are still learning about investing it is ok to actually have the money sit in the bank reply link retirebyforty january    am i’m planning to diversify more but  stocks are quite a lot of keep track of i’ll sell off some of stocks this year reply link chris january    am have you ever considered the higher yielding dividends such as sdrl or agnc and of course there are others if not why not after all you could literally make your dividend in the k range from what it seems you have in other stocks such as ko etc for instance sdrl would be paying out shr over the past year warning they sped up the next quarter dividend into last year to avoid possible tax implications for investors reply link retirebyforty january    am i’m considering reit purchases and will research that next at this point my number  goal is to preserve capital so i don’t want to be more conservative i will probably put at most  into these higher dividend fundsstocks i can’t react fast enough if there are bad news agnc has been doing pretty well reply link jim january    am i’d be careful with some of the high dividend reits looking at agnc they invest in mortgage securities rather than physical real estate they may be making money via arbitrage due to currently low interest rates or simply gambling on high risk mortgages in default i’d take a careful look at their annual report to see what they’re really doing and make sure you know what you’re buying reply link jess january    pm i agree with jim there are various types of reits that specialize in different things and their books are not always easy to comb through for a beginning investor its probably not the best sector to start in as for agnc i currently own it and expect a dividend cut in a quarter or two the feds low interest rate policy is hurting their ability to make money reply link jc  passiveincomepursuit january    am i’m hoping to receive  in dividends and option premiums for the year from selling puts it’s about a  jump from where my forward month dividends were at the end of  should be an interesting year i have a few positions i need to shed as well and also some espp stock that i can start selling off in june for full ltcg treatment best wishes in  reply link jane savers  the money puzzle january    am i first learned about peer to peer lending from your site i have looked in to what is available for me to try in canada and i have decided the industry is too new and the risk is too high for my little bits of available investment money i have enrolled in the drip program for my dividend paying stocks canadians are lucky enough to have a tax free savings account tfsa that i keep my tiny collection of stocks in the dividend income is automatically reinvested in more stocks because i want this income for my retirement i plan to add another canadian bank and perhaps an energy company suncor to my portfolio this year in  i made less than  in passive income but it was my first year buying stocks reply link retirebyforty january    pm i wouldn’t put a lot of money into peer to peer lending great job with the passive income we all have to start somewhere good luck reply link savvyfinanciallatina january    am i think it’s awesome that you are sharing your dividend strategy especially because i wanted to know 🙂 i don’t think we will be able to start investing in a dividend portfolio until  we are concentrating on saving for a down payment i think once we buy a house all the monthly savings that are currently going into house down payment will be free to be invested i’m starting research now though 🙂 reply link retirebyforty january    pm good luck with the house it’s much more affordable in your area i think the price is rising though so you might need to get a down payment together quick reply link savvyfinanciallatina january    pm prices are rising but our apartment lease doesn’t end till the end of  not sure how we could get out of our lease without incurring some hefty fees guess i shouldn’t have signed such a long lease my mistake  at least interest rates are suppose to stay flat plus don’t think we will have the  down payment ready until october k is quite a lot of money reply link hunter january    am would you ever consider trading some stocks for dividend etf’s like sdy or vig it might simplify things although you are extremely well organized and possibly not seeking simplicity i think you’re in great shape all my dividend paying investments are currency in retirement vehicles predominantly roth ira our rental income should surpass k this year – i’m really excited about that and hope to purchase another property next year reply link retirebyforty january    pm i’m thinking about vig if i can’t beat it this year then i’ll probably just move the majority of the investment over great job with the rental income k is awesome reply link mr  january    am from a recent post it sounds like you have some reservations about pp lending prosper and lending club but i suggest you keep at it i’ve been doing it now for over  years and have been able to maintain  income reading lendacademycom is a must as you’ll find a ton of useful information there the main drawback to pp lending is that gains are taxed as normal income reply link retirebyforty january    pm i’m a little discouraged because i’ve had a spade of defaults over the past few months hopefully the default rate will slow down and the roi go back up thanks for the tip i’ll read more there reply link sustainable life blog january    am that is a very enviable set of dividend returns there joe congrats hopefully you dont have as many repair issues in  as you did in  are you planning on increasing your realestate holdings this year or are you comfortable with what you’ve got reply link retirebyforty january    pm i am comfortable with this much headache at the moment 🙂 no more real estate i’m thinking about reit though reply link brick by brick investing january    am i like your goal for  in dividends this year it looks like you have some dividend behemoths in your portfolio do you plan to liquidate some of the more speculativecyclical investments and add more blue chip dividend paying companies such as jnj msft etc reply link retirebyforty january    pm most of these are blue chip stocks already i do plan to move more money toward dividend aristocrats in the future reply link jim january    am looks like a pretty good portfolio what are the red flags based on i was doing more dividend stock investing in my roth account but i’ve mostly switched over to indexes but some of my indexes are dividend focused reply link retirebyforty january    pm they are actually yellow flags i just want to keep an eye on those stocks listed i probably have too much intel and att and should sell some to diversify reply link my own advisor january    am awesome work i hope to hit  this year we’ll see… 🙂 i just posted my december  dividend income on my site i like many your bluechip selections reply link retirebyforty january    pm i like your dividend payout trend i’ll keep track this year and hope to see similar increase thanks reply link pauljyoung january    pm i read a number of books and the ones that give me the best direction in investing for retirement are books written by ric edelman john bogle mark matson and a new one by william worth seven lies financial planners tell and the truth about investing – a kindle book on amazon these writers lay a good foundation for successful investing reply link retirebyforty january    pm thanks for the tips i’ll put them on my list reply link mike  financialmemoscom january    pm great work i am also trying to form a portfolio based on dividends as nothing beats the passive income in addition the fact that no matter what happens to the market if the company is doing well the dividend will be paid makes it even better reply link retirebyforty january    pm good luck with your dividend portfolio reply link my financial independence journey january    pm most of those stocks are standard dividend growth stocks i don’t think that you have too many companies if anything you need a few more in analyzing your portfolio it would be helpful if you could list the weighting of the stocks you suggest that you’ve got a lot of intel stock but how much is a lot i wouldn’t sell att it’s been paying out ever increasing dividends for over  years and i doubt that’s going to change i would run like hell from leggett and platt it’s only a matter of time before they cut their dividend and their stock price tanks too reply link retirebyforty january    pm i have about  shares of intel thanks for the tips i’ll check out leg more reply link my financial independence journey january    pm i’m posting an analysis of leg on monday that will pretty much sum up my opinion of it it’s a dividend cut waiting to happen reply link lance  money life and more january    pm i don’t have a passive income plan… yet right now our goal is to get rid of my girlfriend’s student loans which hopefully will be done this year hopefully we’ll have one for  reply link retirebyforty january    pm good luck getting rid of the student loans it’s tough for young folks these days reply link mike  personal finance beat january    pm love this post i am a big proponent of dividend investing and currently hold the following stocks mo xom jnj kpm mcd pep vz and wmt if you are shooting for k in dividends alone then your portfolio must be pretty large mine is not quite that size yet i’m also looking to get started in peertopeer lending at lending club i would be interested in reading any future posts about your experiences there reply link retirebyforty january    pm i’m investing with prosper but i’m thinking about opening an account at lending club so i can compare the two here is a post about peer to peer lending httpretirebyorgpplendingretirementincome good luck reply link the passive income earner january    pm well done you and my own advisor are ahead of me i am short of k for the year i had higher yielding stocks early on when i started with dividends but since they don’t grow their dividends or appreciate as much i started focusing on buying valued dividend aristocrats where i know i get a dividend raise every year in some cases i look for those that increase their dividend by  on average reply link retirebyforty january    pm  sounds like a good number to shoot for i’ll see by the end of the year if we can hit that good luck in  reply link kitty january    pm are you ever tempted to sell when its near the higher prices and buy back the att stock a month later could you maybe explain why it would be a bad idea to do that other than worrying that the stock price doesn’t go down again are there any significantly negative reasons to not sell the att stock once the capital gain net of shortterm capital gain and commission costs is at least double the next quarterly dividend net of qualified dividend tax rate reply link kitty january    pm sorry if this there’s a really obvious reason why and i’m just missing it  reply link retirebyforty january    pm it’s just a lot of headache i usually sell if i don’t want to own the investment anymore i guess if you have time to keep track of everything then it might be a good idea i don’t like paying a lot of tax either 🙂 reply link mike january    pm i guess i am not as interested in stocks as some people are i am spending more of time with mutual funds iras and a few of the other alternatives out there on the market i guess i err on the side of caution on that reply link jt january    pm if you’re going to hold stocks you might want to consider selling covered calls against them for additional monthly income as long as you have at least  shares of a stock you can do it some people think trading options is risky but this strategy is one of the least risky since all your downside risk is in holding stock in the first place reply link retirebyforty january    pm i’m sell some covered call this year it doesn’t seem to generate much money though reply link anil  peercube january    pm great post on generating passive income through dividends i agree  dividend stocks seems to be too many unless this portfolio is mm if you are interested in dividend through individual stocks i will suggest you look into value oriented stock selection strategies such as dogs of dow dogs of sp and in general dogs of index and trim the number of stocks in your portfolio i also wouldn’t discount buying growthcapital appreciation stocks for generating passive income buy one growth stock every month after a year review the stock either sell whole position or capital appreciation portion do the same for every stock on  month anniversary you will have nice monthly gains assuming you have large enough position in each stock for transaction cost to be just a blip and stocks of established stable companies that don’t swing big in short term reply link krantcents january    pm if you just shift your investments to higher yielding investments it seems you would achieve your goal i am less concerned about passive income however i want growth for now as i get closer to retirement i will shift to stabilize my portfolio reply link retirebyforty january    pm i want growth too but the growth stocks didn’t do much better than dividend stocks over the last few years reply link jon  moneysmartguides january    pm good to see i’m not the only one unsure about what to do with abbott the majority of the dividend went with the new company but i think the “old” abbott will increase it’s dividend quickly but i’m not so sure how quickly reply link retirebyforty january    pm we’ll have to keep an eye on the old abbott the yield is quite low at the moment reply link rod j rogers freeagentrogers january    pm congrats on making money in rentals i’m selling mine off as owner financed sales to get rid of the headaches reply link retirebyforty january    pm i’ll try it for a few more years if we can’t make it work i’ll probably move the investment over to reits reply link simple moolah january    pm hi joe i think that it’s great that you have a goal to increase your passive income for  and you have a plan laid out for it it has definitely inspired me to do the same i’m new to your site and have been looking around and i find your story very inspirational in terms of stock picking my belief is to learn from those who are successful in doing whatever it is you want to accomplish so for me i chose to follow warren buffett the book i read called “warren buffet and the interpretation of financial statements” has helped me tremendously in picking good quality stocks this book teaches you how to interpret a company’s financial statements and determine if it’s a good company to invest in or not these are the principles that warren follows if you’re looking for ways to increase your dividend portfolio from stocks this book will definitely help you find those quality stocks to keep for the long term wishing you all the best with your goals for  reply link retirebyforty january    pm thanks for the recommendation i’ll put it on my reading list good luck to you as well reply link t january    pm fabulous post my favorite thus far was hoping you would elaborate on the dividend income if i had a few hours i could transpose that information into excel and figure this out myself so i don’t feel nosey asking but how much total did you have invested purely in dividend stocks not including the stocks that gave surprise dividends to get that return i’m an amateur at all this but i did purchase agnc and pbi in the last quarter of  and though they’re both down  again amateur they did make about  in that last dividend payout reply link retirebyforty january    pm the current valuation is a little over k i’m not sure about how money i have invested because i have been adding to the investment over the years good luck in  reply link email protected credit report chick january    am i’m new to the whole passive income movement but i’m jumping in

link dividend january    am good but i think that see history of the company before investing in dividends reply link jay january    am how about doing more rentals i pay my entire mortgage through them the problem with rentals though is that if you want to get enough to live off of managing things yourself will not scale to combat that this year i want to try some turnkey companies that will rehab and manage your rentals for you this way it’s more passive and you can take advantage of lower outofstate prices best example i saw recently a duplex in ohio that would give over a  cashoncash roi after taxes and insurance this year i’ll probably get something in ohio and next month i’m heading to tennessee to check things out there let me know if you’re interested i’ll let you know how it goes reply link retirebyforty january    pm i like rentals but i’m not sure if i have the temperament to be a landlord in the long term i think we have enough properties at the moment we’ll see in a few years if we can continue to be invested reply link integrator january    am nice work joe my only suggestion to you would be to focus on stocks that can drive higher dividend growth over time try and look past the higher yield today to that end your right on looking to get rid of att they don’t generate the growth to lift their dividend more than low single digits today cme is one i’d suggest you look into i just recently reviewed it be a little watchful of western union as well it’s had flat revenue and cash flow growth for quite some time integrator reply link retirebyforty january    am thanks i’ll focus on dividend growth for future investments i’ll do some research on cme reply link the dividend guy blog january    am first thx for the mention 🙂 i truly appreciate it i can see in

“selling watch list” this year 🙂 reply link retirebyforty january    pm in this portfolio i collect the dividend until i can buy other stocks intc and t are on my sell list your  list was really helpful reply link thegooch january    pm i’ve never invested in dividend stocks but i have dabbled with lending club i still have to much debt to invest much even for retirement this post has renewed my desire to at least allocate a small slice of my discretionary income in passive streams of income reply link retirebyforty january    am good luck generally i would recommend paying off high interest debt first but dabbling a bit in investing is a good thing too go for it reply link the college investor february    pm i’m a big fan of abt and abbv they are both paying dividends and both are highly rated by wall street i highly recommend holding both for at least a year before selling i think both with be great plays just different companies abbott will now be the slow steady consumer products company while abbvie will be the pharma company humera is still on patent for a while so give it a chance to develop reply link mike february    pm interesting read i haven’t touched the

when i try to get into trading later this year that’s the plan anyways reply link s b march    pm i agree with the comments suggesting more diversity rather than less it’s not really that difficult to

income with  stocks but i am more focused on increasing my positions now then adding new stocks the number of stocks is not really what drives the income but rather the amount of money invested and therefore how much you have saved reply link mayanqueen july    pm retireby do you know anything about scottrade to manage investments i am new at it and want to try with help i work full time and really wouldn’t have time to watch over my investments after reading many of your posts and watching my i brother struggle as a landlord…i believe i am ready but with help when you invest and buy do you just go directly to each company or do you need a broker to buy thanks for sharing and helping god bless you and your loved ones reply link retirebyforty july    am i think scottrade is a discount broker they don’t usually help with investment management if you are just starting out i would invest in a vanguard index fund like vtsmx or vfinx these are big funds with many many companies in them you just need to keep adding to your investment every month and you should do well in  years you can also buy individual stocks company like apple through scottrade you probably should put this off until you are more comfortable with stock investing good luck reply link davidmichael august    pm just a short note about dividend paying stocks i think this is a great way to add passive income my attorney has invested his retirement funds around dividend paying stocks and is doing very well i note that some people suggest trading here and there for added funds after  years of stock trading with options stocks as well as covered calls i don’t recommend trading at all buffet said it well…”rule  don’t lose money rule  don’t forget rule ” i recommend a solid portfolio of  dividend paying

portfolio that have individual stocks i keep my ibonds at treasury direct taxable account you don’t have to pay tax until you redeem though you probably need to read a good reit book i don’t know much about them either 🙁 the book was pretty boring… reply link fab august    am hi which brokerage are you using for your taxable dividend portfolio do you know of any free screenerplatform where it’s possible to set email alerts based on price i currently keep all my kira money in vanguard index funds but plan on building an earlyretirement taxable dividend portfolio of around  stocks thanks reply link retirebyforty august    pm i’m using firstrade i don’t know about the email alerts you probably should google that and see if you can find any good site good luck reply link drew  financialvoodoocom august    am i see your gain on the securities was only   dividends so what was your overall return on these securities not to be mean but my way of thinking says to look at the return of an investment not just the dividends to me it seems like you might do better with a simple cover call strategy it might not be dividends but its more consistent and more frequent returns where you can choose your own shielding to downward movement i would argue that cover calling is more conservative than your approach with better returns reply link mike november    pm i’m attempting to retire in one year i am in the process of moving about m of my nest egg into high dividend etfs for now i’m in lvl dwx sdiv i should get around  dividend annually if they repeat past performance and the exposure is global i’d like to add two or three more to the mix my question is will i get the same sort of yield appreciation over time that one can get from owning an individual stock one example would be where a company raises its dividend annually as its share price increases so as to keep the annual dividend yield constant after ten years the yield on the original investment would no doubt reach double digits reply link ap march    pm am i missing out by not investing in individual dividend stocks i am currently  years old i am following the low cost passive indexing approach my portfolio currently contains the vanguard us total stock market fund vanguard small cap index value fund and the vanguard total international fund i am  us international i do get some nice sizable dividends quarterly i like this simple approach… occasionally i have dabbled in some momentum stocks and turned a nice profit but that’s about it i sleep better a night not being in any one individual stock for the most part reply link retirebyforty march    pm it sounds like you’re very comfortable with your style of investing so you probably stick with it the sleep better at night factor is a big one reply link brian august    pm i had pretty much the same approach that you had except i also had a bit of this and a bit of that dividend growth stocks pure tech growth stocks stock dujurs etc i’ve recently made a switch to a mostly dividend growth model and currently have  positions in  different accounts k rollover ira roth ira and brokerage that has a total portfolio weighted yield of  with an overall weighted beta of  which i feel is pretty strong considering the higher than average yield i still currently hold  of my total portfolio in various index tracking funds and  of that is in my k i’m using the index funds as a balance with my dividend growth and high yield dividend portfolios i’m still in a few pure growth stocks zero dividends and i don’t know how much longer i’ll be in those but for now they’re holding well and i like the companies so it’s ok as they’re only  of my total portfolio like you i’ve been sleeping better at night knowing that my portfolio is working for me as well with the dividend growth choices i’ve made it’s not an easy conversion and it’s not for everyone good luck with your future choices reply link pdxlager april    am so  in dividend income would be about  after state  federal income taxes or about month what is the total taxable portfolio size about k the only downside is that you are trading long term compounded growth for current earnings but i’m sure you’re already aware of that and it sounds like you know what you’re doing and why i have a less ambitious goal of buying enough stock in a company to offset my expenses in that company’s productservice such as buying enough nwn northwest natural gas shares so that their annual dividend pays my entire gas bill 🙂 reply link jim may    pm dividend investing – qualified plans i actually would take issue with your dividend investing approach nothing wrong with the stocks but save for t and mo none of them generate dividends in excess of the rmd and as you note most did not have principal growth and most are slow dividend growers true most have drip plans so you will get a boost from compounding so for creating wealth i would question whether this is the best approach my portfolio currently generates about  on invested capital the universe of holdings is made up of bdc’s closed end mlp’s to avoid ubti an mreit etn morl natural resource etf ggn natural gas storage nka dry bulk shipper nmm and a few others oxlc nymt nti  i have rounded out the portfolio with additional growth names mo vz scco clf dow on which i can write monthly calls that generate about  –  per month in additional income like yours most of these do not offer much growth so they are ‘coupon clippers’ most either have drips or the equivalent through my broker schwab anyway that’s what i’m doing jim reply link retirebyforty may    am thanks for your input i’m not familiar with the stocks you hold so i’ll need to check them out actually my portfolio has about  yield on invested capital check it out httpretirebyorgeffortlesslyincreasedividendyield reply link joe december    pm hello i am new to this site i really like the idea of dividend investing to generate passive income just wondering how much capital you need to have invested to be able to generate  to k a year in dividend income can anyone shed some light thank you reply link retirebyforty december    pm if you invest pretty conservatively you’d need around k to generate  to k if you’re willing to take on more risk then probably less good luck reply link cancel reply leave a comment name  email  website

calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the morningstar rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics ratings may vary by share class ratings andor rankings may be based in part on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by janus henderson methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the ratingranking when an expense waiver is in effect it may have a material effect on the total return or yield and therefore the ranking andor rating for the period the morningstar equity style box™ reveals a funds investment strategy for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth the morningstar fixedincome style box™ reveals a funds investment style as of the date noted for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for a list of all nrsros please visit httpswwwsecgovocrratingagencyhtml additionally morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies if two rating organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the lower rating if three or more organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the median rating and in cases where there are more than two organizationagency ratings and a median rating does not exist fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings please note morningstar inc is not itself a nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund a nrsro or rating agency ratings can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected
