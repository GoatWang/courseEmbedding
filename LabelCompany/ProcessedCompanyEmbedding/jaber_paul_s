research and design teams at some of the world’s most influential companiesbefore joining intercom he helped design vacuums at dyson helped design gmail youtube and google and then at facebook he led their ad units team before becoming their global head of brand designi talked to paul recently about the principles and practices he brought to intercom from facebook and google how and why he developed a  roadmap for the company and what startups should be focusing on in this coming year take a listen below if you like what you hear check out more podcast episodes or subscribe to the inside intercom podcast on itunes stitcher or over at soundcloudif you’d prefer to read paul’s insights a lightly edited transcript of our conversation is below short on time here are seven quick takeaways from our chathaving unlimited engineers and designers at your disposal isn’t always a good thing when you’ve limited resources at your disposal it forces you to focus on what’s importantbigger teams and lengthy requirements are a surefire way to slow down product development small teams and shorter cycles on projects are some of the best ways to make sure you continue to build things quicklywhen you’re building a product you have to balance the day to day to day activities with the long term vision thinking in terms of six years six months and six weeksgetting the balance right between competing priorities in your product is only achieved by having a well defined roadmap with clearly defined inputsmost companies focus on  incremental improvements aiming for a x improvement ten times better than what exists today can help redefine the problem entirelythe experience of our mobile homescreen being a bank of app icons is dying we’re moving towards apps as serviceswhen planning the year ahead it’s worth ignoring end of year predictions of what’s to come instead focus on the longterm and how you can enact your visiondes traynor today i’m joined by our vp of product paul for the benefit of our listeners who haven’t tracked your career as closely as i have prior to intercom you worked at google and facebook you’ve worked on products like gmail youtube google google maps and latitude at facebook you were the product manager for facebook’s ad units as the end user experience system is that rightpaul adams yeah at the time there were about five or six product managers in the ads team at facebook i understand now it’s far greater than that there was four or five pms for the advertiser’s experience – how you create an ad with workflows analytics things like that then i was the sole pm for the ad units which were the things the end users of facebook would experiencedes on one hand i’m tempted to read something into the  ratio but on the other hand it’s actually admirable that they had anyone doing it rightpaul at the time yeah i think there isn’t much to read into the  ratio other than there’s tons of work on the advertiser’s side there’s a lot of complex historical precedents for the types of things you need in order to run ads across networksdes you were effectively the good guy of the end user you were making sure it wasn’t as bad as it should bepaul depends how you think about it the other pms who are listening to this would say they’re good guys too they were helping advertisers make sense of something that was complicated and new at the time this would have been  or  at the time facebook’s advertising network ecosystem the ideas the company had for ads were pretty radical for advertisers it was overwhelming since then the team have done a phenomenally good job of making it much easier to understand they would say they are the good guys for the advertisersdes absolutely lots of good guys 🙂 paul all good guysthe benefit of limited resourcesdes google and facebook some of the most popular products in the world you’ve worked on was there a significant difference in how a product was run between facebook and googlepaul they were definitely different it depends how you think about it were these deliberate differences or functions of scale the biggest difference for me was the teams i tended to work in at google – i worked in the ux team at google – were really big big by facebook standards and big by intercom standards there would have been  in teamsthe vast majority of those would be engineers there would be a couple of product managers and maybe a couple of designers at facebook the scale was just entirely different the ad units team i was the product manager for had me one designer and three engineers at times we had four engineersdes spoiledpaul crazy days yeah 🙂 we mostly had three engineers and that was somewhat deliberate you’re somewhat starved of resources in the hope that you would focus on the most important things in my experience if you give a team many many engineers such that the ratio of product management to design to engineering isn’t right you will get people doing things that aren’t necessarily aligned with the vision or the product plan or the roadmap the product manager can’t stay on top of many engineers who want to do good work and want to build things the engineers want to be efficient with their time they’re creative and so they will go and build things that may not necessarily be positive overalldes you speak about a ratio there is that something you keep in mind has it got to do with how much work the pm can keep track of is there a golden ratio for you herepaul i have a ratio people would disagree with me on this i’ve had this debate many times with many people i should preface this by saying it really depends on what type of problem you’re solving some problems are computationally heavy at google for example some of the problems in search are very computationally heavy there’s lots of engineers who are purely working on background infrastructure or writing algorithmshere at intercom the ratio we’re trying to employ is  one product manager one product designer and then four to five engineers when it gets to five engineers pms and designers start asking me about when they’re going to get helpthe  product team ratiodes do you start thinking we need to break this team up into two subteams or does it look like an extra designer would you be happy to scale the whole thing up according to that ratiopaul yeah i think it depends on the type of problem or team you’ve got at intercom we’re still figuring that out i think to some degree as a product gets bigger or as you expand your horizons for what a product might cover or entail the team can be split in two they would have subchallenges within a central theme if you do that the risk is with individual teams you’re splitting things up you need someone who is gluing this all together there’s different ways this can work sometimes you can have a group pm type role and then more junior product managers who are more executional in those multiple teams that can work well if you’ve got a really good group pm or someone who is strong at thinking strategically horizontally and systematically or you can grow the team internally at times when i worked on gmail there were two pms who between them figured out how things would work it was more of a partnershipsmall teams and shorter cyclesdes interesting what if anything did you borrow or take inspiration from when you designed how intercom built its product from facebook or google paul i like to think i took the best of both 🙂des i like to think that too 🙂paul there were things at facebook i thought were phenomenally great things like smaller teams for example or shorter cycles on project development facebook would typically move faster and build things faster i think a lot of that was down to how their culture worked and how their teams were structured the culture was very oral at the time at least when i worked there people didn’t write stuff down there’s cost to that too but if you’re sitting around each other at the same desks you’re talking everyday you’re there everyday you can get a lot done without having to write all the stuff down by using whiteboards insteadat google it was a bit bigger the artifacts tended to be different google have this prd process – product requirements doc – which is basically their project brief in my experience they were long many many pages at times i left google seven years ago i don’t know what it’s like today as far as i understand prds still exist but i don’t know what length they tend to be written the longer the doc the less it gets read the longer the doc the less it gets remembered for example here in our product process i employ a strict one page rule when i see the equivalent of a prd the first point of feedback i have is give me the one pager it’s kind of a similar philosophy to facebook if you’re starved of resources you’ll focus if you’re forced to limit the brief to one page you will get much better at describing the problem you’re solving or the opportunity coherently i think it’s just a much better way to worka one page intermission document succinctly describes the problem we’re solvingdes did you take any inspiration from google on how you set up the product team herepaul i honestly took more inspiration from the way facebook was structured i think you can tease out why that is it wasn’t that things at google were worse necessarily i think the types of problems we are solving and the types of problems facebook solve are similar we’re both building communication platforms we deal with a lot of the same types of design problems we both have a messenger we’re both trying to build things inside a messenger whereas some of the things i worked on at google were just bigger the time frames were typically longer so i guess that changed how you work if you have a bigger product a bigger product release with a longer time frame then i guess the artifacts tend to changewhere will your product be in six yearsdes that makes sense one cornerstone you outlined recently of how you think about product teams is this idea of a  roadmap thinking in terms of six years six months and six weeks could you talk us through what that’s aboutpaul it sounds catchy  🙂 it’s proving to be incredibly useful for all our team i learned a version of this at facebook and evolved it and changed it for our benefit here when i was working at facebook some of the product management team talked in terms of two timelines they talked about twenty years and six months the idea was that twenty years was your vision it was your vision for the future how you thought the world would have changed in twenty years time and how you may fulfill the mission you’ve set yourself twenty years is way too long to be pragmatic to make it pragmatic realistic and actually get things built six months was the time frame to work towards you could build over the next six months heading for this twenty year vision over the course of those six months things will change and it was a rolling timeline as you get three four months in you might make plans for the next six monthsat intercom we’re a startup it’s different twenty years as a cycle for startups is probably too long it depends what you do but for us certainly i think twenty years is too far ahead for it to be in any way useful six months is pretty long as well six months in our life is a long time we get a lot built shipped and released in six monthsi changed the timelines to  – six years six months and six weeks six years is not a prediction of technologies it’s not what you think will have happened technologically over the next six years it’s actually how the world changed over that period of time because of what you didin other words if you weren’t around if your company wasn’t around your vision would never come to pass the world would look different our six year vision is how the world will have changed because of what we did that’s what is inspiring about it we’re enacting the change the change isn’t just going to happen because a bunch of people invented new technologies six months is then our concrete plan towards that sixyear vision six months is a good time frame for us to think about we’ll generally be a similar size in terms of our teams and employees over a six month period beyond six months i think is bad i often say a two year timeframe is the worst there are exceptions to this of course like with everything hardware for example things that have longer production cycles with software i think two years is terrible in two years time it’s far enough into the future that it’s not particularly visionary but it’s also too far ahead to really have a concrete plantwo years from today we’ll see two new android versions two new ios versions we’ll also see potentially new hardware from both apple and samsung or google it just would look different if we had a twoyear plan two years ago there would be no watches or any of that kind of stuff going on it just means you get circular it’s chaotic i think six months is as long as you should think ahead if you’re a startup six weeks is just our nuts and bolts dialedin version of what we’re building and shipping if you had a sixyear vision and you can map out the next six months everyone knows where we’re headed six weeks is the daytoday stepbystep progress the march towards that planthe balancing act of product managementdes it’s interesting six years is quite a long time it’s long enough to think of these mammoth changes to how a task gets done or to what it is that users are trying to do whereas six weeks is very much incremental let’s add bits and pieces here how do you like your pms to balance the idea of “i want to redefine what the product is” to “we’d better add this button”paul we’ve developed a process it’s basically a balancing act if you try and do this in your mind in my experience it won’t go well you will overcompensate for some things versus others you will forget things it goes without saying that the job of product manager is an extremely hard one you’ve got to keep so much stuff in your head at all levels you’ve got to be able to think really strategically and longterm you’ve got to be able to think really tactically on a daytoday basis and you’ve to deal with everything inbetween – issues and bugs latency speed new features improvements radical new things versus iterative things the way we’ve done this is we’ve got five inputs to our road map five explicit inputs and we balance themthe five inputs into our product roadmap we’re extremely research driven so there’s just one input of the five that’s not research driven that input is things we think are cool and exciting there’s going to be no basis in research it’s things that we just think would be interesting usually the reason we think it’s interesting is because we’ve read lots of blog posts about it des there’s just no formal research i guesspaul exactly the research is almost done subconsciously in your brain through osmosis and then just chatting to people things we believe in is one inputthe second input is iterating recent product in my experience this is something you need to do deliberately or you just won’t it’s so easy to ship something and forget about it ship something move on the shiny new ball syndrome our philosophy here is we ship to learn we’ll ship and then we’ll figure out if it’s good or bad did it actually solve the problem we identified early on we’ll set time aside to iteratedes the way i phrase that for people is every feature you ship comes with its own roadmap you have to manage as well your product might now have data visualizations but now you have a data visualization roadmap of all the things you need to add to the data visualizations feature i think a lot of people forget that and they get hungover on celebrating yesterday’s shipment rather than thinking about today’s new feature requestpaul yeah totally that’s definitely the way i think about it as well how good are we at removing things i think we’re not bad we do remove features that don’t get used generally speaking i think it’s true of almost every piece of software that they get bigger they just naturally get bigger you build more than you take away and there’s an art to trying to add more power without adding more complexity which is a whole other thing typically people build more and so it gets more complex you do actually inherit a whole bunch of new usage patterns that never existed before now there’s x number of people using this new thing we built and we need to talk to them tooour third input is dedicated to feedback we hear from customers this is heavily research driven heavily qualitatively driven our customer support team is an incredible asset to us here we think of our customer support team quite strategically in that regard they’re not just there to service customers and keep them happy though that’s clearly an important thing they’re also there as an amazing input into our roadmap when they’re talking to customers through intercom they’re talking to customers everyday they’re tagging conversations with what team it relates to whether it’s a usability problem a feature request or some area of confusion they’re tagging all these conversations and then our product managers are synthesizing that our research team helps as well then they basically build a hit list of things that our customers needthe important part in this roadmap is that we don’t just do what customers are asking we prioritize them based on our own vision and mission if you have this sixyear vision it’s easy to look at a bunch of feature requests and actually decide to not do some our customers don’t have the same insight into what our vision is as we do and so we often decide to not do things that are heavily requested when we make that decision we’ll actually then tell customers that we’ve no plans to build that thing the other important caveat is often people users of your product don’t know what they need i often say this to our team customers are experts in their problem they’re not experts in the best solution they will often describe their problem in terms of a solution so they’ll ask you for what they think they need what we’ll often do is get our product managers to go back to those people and start talking to them “hey you asked for this feature what are you trying to do why did you ask for that” they’ll actually get to the root of the problem multiple layers deep of investigation basically a whole other input is customer requests as intercom gets bigger as we continue to grow and grow quickly we get bigger customers different types of customers that have different needs than other companies that have used intercom historically you have a whole track for that a whole track for how does intercom work on scale bigger companies with bigger teams more users it’s just different we’ve a whole track dedicated to that for a long time i think we got away with designing intercom for ourselves the companies that use intercom are very similar to us we’re very attuned to the problems they have as we’ve grown our user base has diversified now we need to realize that we’re not actually experts in all the problems that other companies havethe fifth input is around quality quality includes things like bugs issues performance latency they’re the five inputs into our product roadmap the balance to this is basically making sure that we’re we’re making progress on all fivethe one thing i would say in case anyone listening wants to go set a  rule for each of the five inputs is we oscillate we absolutely oscillate and that’s the right thing to do we’ll go through a phase of building new product and then our issue count will rise we’ll go through another phase where we’ll focus on getting that count down we’ve had issues in the past where it oscillated too much now we’ve got a way better balance if you look at our roadmap and it’s documented you will see that every project has one of these five inputs written beside it are you focusing on x or des it’s interesting the way you describe the things we believe versus working on a feature we just shipped you can totally see the bonds between trying to come up with something that’s  better than what’s live versus something that’s just absolutely better to do this stuff the things we believe type stuff do you encourage the pms to have a vision of what a fundamentally better intercom looks likepaul yeah this is really interesting ken norton is a partner at google ventures and he was a product manager at google before that he gave a talk at mind the product a really great product conference if you haven’t heard of it beforeken gave a really interesting talk at last year’s conference the gist of it was the difference between x type projects or companies and  type projects and companies  of the time people end up heading towards the  improvement versus the x improvement the x is literally ten times better than what exists today the reason for that is risk it’s risky to go x because if you fail you’ve just failedtwo projects with their expected values in yellow credit ken nortonwhereas  is safe you can add  get  better and you can have a very predictable track of work generally it’s hard to totally screw it up the difference is the  companies are probably on some local maximum they’re just iterating towards something that’s going to have diminishing returns over timewhereas the x companies are ones that will actually disrupt the market and come up with something radically different if you have this explicit mindset of a x versus a  when you tackle the same problem you tackle it from the x point of view and you think absolutely differently about it totally different all the assumptions and existing ways of working will go out the window you’ll radically rethink ways in which it might work challenge all assumptions and go back to first principles we use that phrase at intercom go back to first principles it means tearing away all the existing constraints for how things actually work and starting from scratch getting to the root of a problem and then working from theredes what’s an example of this when you think about it in terms of intercom what’s an area we see  things and x thingspaul one example is colin bentley our product manager for our engage product colin’s done some really good  improvements recently a few months ago we launched a feature called delivery windows before when you sent a message via intercom it sent whenever the criteria matched a user a user has done x or y the message got sent and they got it straightaway a  improvement there is a delivery window that doesn’t send on saturdays or sundays or doesn’t send at am in the person’s local timezone they’re simple little incremental  improvement but colin is not only thinking about that he’s thinking about a x improvement what’s a x improvement for a better way for a company to send messages to users then you start thinking about radically different thingsyou don’t start thinking about a delivery window setting on a message that turns off saturdays you start thinking about artificial intelligence and machine learning could we take inspiration from things like ‘if this then that’ could we actually write algorithms to figure out when to send that message a x improvement would be we’ve built algorithms we’ve used ai we have a machine learning ecosystem it just works by magic and you should trust us that’s x colin again our product manager for this area is doing some  improvements but he should be also thinking and is thinking x x is where the real value lies in the longer term you know at intercom we see ourselves very much as a longterm company we plan to be around for a long long time and so x is critical to our futurethe end of apps as we know themdes changing tack a bit a year ago you wrote a piece which caused a little bit of uproar where you said it is the end of apps as we know them i think a lot of people missed the second clause there that was about a year ago it’s interesting to look back at it and ask how far do you think we’ve come along this waypaul it is fascinating actually it’s a fascinating question i had to write a second followup blog post called it’s not the end of appsdes that was an awkward day on the index page of the blog 🙂paul it was an argument that at some level we have reached bankruptcy in terms of apps this idea was that that these apps on our home screen apps nested in folders of apps is crazy it’s not a good experience nobody from the start of the iphone looking forward or in  looking back nobody would be proud of this outcomethat’s not a sustainable model all of the ecosystem has been built up around this the cottage industry if you like around the app store is all optimized for getting that download getting that button on your screen what i was positing at the time was this will change i was looking at the evolution of the notifications panel on phones notifications are starting to become much richer in terms of the content that’s being delivered much more interactive the older model was that notifications were signpostsyou’d get a notification that’s deep linking you into that app the notification does nothing whereas these newer notifications the newest version of android at the time you could actually retweet something from the notifications panel or you could reply to something that’s directionally the future more so than appsi actually referenced google now a lot i thought google now was a great model for this potentially i would imagine this is total speculation but that google now and the notifications panel in android would merge they’re effectively trying to do the same thing the notifications panel will suffer from volume at some point so they need to rank it google now is trying to do that bring information to you before you know you need it by knowing what you like etcthe idea i was expecting was google now would evolve really fast i thought my experience of google now would be that it would full of third party apps full of third party content i thought i’d be replying texting writing and taking actions with many app workflows in each google now card that’s what i thought would happen i thought at the google io just gone we’d see that i thought we would see some radical step change in how google now works that didn’t happen i’ve no idea why google now has improved in a whole bunch of different ways but it’s just been slower than i thought on the other side though things happened i had no idea were going to happen at all but are directionally supporting this idea that apps and the app icon are coming to an end or changing at leastan entire uber workflow embedded within foursquare ken nortonwhat you’re starting to see is apps integrating with other apps today for example if i open foursquare i can call an uber from foursquare the way it works is this little sdk and uber is basically embedded in foursquare you might not have uber but you have foursquare you tap uber in foursquare and foursquare they have enough context and data to actually order you an uber this to me is a glimpse into the future there’s a few interesting things you can pull out of that one is you’re thinking about services and not apps at this point uber isn’t an app not in the traditional sense they probably don’t give a monkeys at this point if the app is downloaded they care if an uber gets ordered foursquare users could keep ordering ubers in foursquare and never download the uber app and uber probably doesn’t caredes it’s interesting thinking will change engagement metrics and thoughts around is my product doing well even that question isn’t relevant in that worldpaul absolutely this is a relic of the powers at play and the ecosystem that exists app owners typically obsess about app store reviews and that’s all to do with further downloads rather than try to get you to use it more they actually optimize to get your friend to download it now we’ve seen that the app store is filled with millions of apps with hundreds of thousands of users and close to zero engagement there’s lots of statistics on this i think the average person uses eighteen apps a week and they have way more than that on their phone they have like fifty to a hundred apps on their phonedes one thing that stands out for me there is the idea that uber in that example exists in another app’s context if you know what i mean foursquare’s bringing something to the party it’s saying “here’s where you are are here’s where you want to go” uber is living inside that you think that model of apps borrowing context from each other is going to be the new way it used to be people talked about it as being deep linking or whatever how do you string apps together or whatever this is actually a deeper than that right this is how do you make the functionality of an app live inside another apppaul yeah totally i guess websites the original structure of html is a good example all links did was point you to another place like a signpost in the road it’s like there’s a fork in the road and you can take one road or you can take the other the signpost has no opinion about which road you take it doesn’t even know where you want to go deep linking suffers a little bit from that it’s trying to replicate links and signposts whn the deeper integration is way more interesting take button for example what button do is basically provide buttons within apps they provide that uber button in foursquare for example what button actually do really is much more of a backend servicei’m not entirely sure the technologies of this but basically they have sdks in theory uber can give button a bunch of context and button can pass that on to foursquare whole workflows could be developed here if you order an uber in foursquare it actually lets you choose the car suddenly now parts of the uber workflows are inside foursquare you can extend that then to context suddenly the foursquare experience of uber could be totally personalized based on your usage of uber elsewhere that’s fascinatingdes this idea this is akin to what fred wilson wrote when he was talking about contextual run times rightpaul yeah there’s been great reading towards the end of the year benedict evans wrote a fantastic post called 6 mobile theses which is just sixteen things that are happening in mobile some more speculative than others then fred wilson wrote a followup post in response as one of ben’s theses was that there’s going to be a new runtime the app store model that exists is not sustainable you can look to asia for a lot of this a lot of this is already built inside wechat wechat is an entire ecosystem of services and apps running inside wechat if you open maps in we chat for example you can order a taxi from the map they’re not really apps anymore their services there’s now a new runtime they’re running in another environment that could be a platform or it could be a different app like a maps app who knowsfred’s point was that it will just be entirely dependent on context the context of what you’re currently doing will inform the types of new services you get of course we might get this wrong such that the service you actually want isn’t being provided in that runtime it’s being provided in some other run time they probably do all sorts of stupid things like shopping and geotargeting i think again the world of advertising might get this terribly wrong before they get it right it will be really interesting to see how this evolvesthe real impact of long term thinkingdes for sure it’s a really interesting trend i think the thing i like most about it is it provides these clean break points in workflows if you know the next logical step is to book a restaurant you now have a way to facilitate that within your product whereas before it’s just like well off you go some other product now takes over it’s interesting as startups look towards 6 what should they think about in terms of their product teams for the year that lies aheadpaul what i try to avoid and my advice to other people is to avoid getting wrapped up in all these adhoc lists top ten new technologies in 6 ten things to watch out from apple in 6 unless there’s some really good analysis and insight by a really good writer they’re a waste of space 🙂instead i’d go back to what we we talked about earlier the  vision or along that kind of general timeframe if you have this longer term vision the change you want to enact in the world then that helps you get away from all these technologies of 6 virtual reality will come up as oculus is going to launch to the public early next year but we didn’t know what would happen with ipad or iphone and this is going to be similar putting in place some product strategy putting in place some sixmonth roadmap around vr is probably not smart unless you work in gaming or something that’s clearly going to be disrupted by this ideahaving that sixyear vision is way more important my advice to people as we go into 6 is actually to think much more long term des cool i think we should probably leave it there and go back to work 🙂 paul thank you very muchpaul cool thanks for having me  comments hide comments related articles podcast intercom’s karen church on

podcast  talking trends in product with intercom’s paul adams and emmet connolly subscribe des traynor cofounder  chief strategy officer intercom destraynor as we turn the page to  we’ve been thinking a lot about the buzzwords and trends of the past yearthings like chatbots voice ui conversational commerce machine learning moving from screens to systems – all were discussed and debated anywhere and everywhere including our own blog we at intercom also had a handful of massive launches in 6 including smart campaigns a new messenger and educate our knowledge base product and that has us reflecting on a year’s worth of lessons learnedto make sense of the past year and dig into where product and design are headed next i hosted a roundtable discussion with paul adams our vp of product and emmet connolly our director of product designif you like what you hear check out more episodes of our podcast you can subscribe on itunes or grab the rss feedwhat follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview but if you’re short on time here are five key takeawaysgiven today’s technology chatbots are best left to handling computation things that require empathy or emotion on the other hand are still better handled by a humanfrom airbnb’s launch of trips to instagram’s addition of stories products built as systems rather than a set of screens became more prevalent in the past year as new uses are demanded for your product your system will have to expandbreakthrough products target existing behaviors rather than asking users to break from the norm 6 featured two prime examples of the former snapchat spectacles and tesla’s solar tilesproduct teams must make a philosophical shift after they launch a product as the team enters iteration every previous decision is back on the tabledefining conversational commerce as sending texts to a bot is simply too narrow product builders must expand that view and look at their product as an ecosystem with many endpoints – and messaging is just one of themdes traynor today i’m lucky to be joined by paul adams our vp of product and emmet connolly our director of product design 6 was marked in a lot of ways by bots we had our own opinions and we had our own experiments as did the entire industry is the future of product design really gonna sit inside a chat bubblepaul adams both emmet and i wrote a lot of blog posts about bots over the year and we built a lot of bots too some of them saw the light of day some didn’t we learned that bots are overhyped for very human things like empathy and emotion bots are terriblewhat we didn’t realize is that bots do work for a very specific set of use cases that are probably narrower than people first imagined there was a crazy ai vision of the future where bots are as intelligent as humans and our biggest realization was that bots are good at some things and humans are good at other things bots are really good at computation bots are basically simple computers so if you need to ask somebody what your next bill was gonna be a bot can calculate that far faster than a human who’d have to look up the system find your account look at the ui and find the number for very human things like empathy emotion and reading between the lines of what someone’s actually trying to say bots are terrible at that given today’s technologydes emmet from a design perspective it sounds like you’d have to spend half your time dealing with whether or not the bot knows the answer in the majority of cases the bot’s probably not going do a good job rightemmet connolly we have a system whereby a human or a bot could answer your question and so it becomes more of a rooting problem than a problem of “what do i do in this failure case where the bot doesn’t know the answer” if the bot doesn’t know an answer or can’t provide a great one then the human should provide the answerpaul and emmet’s teams designed educate intercom’s new knowledge base product for bots to supplement a human customer support where appropriatea lot of the pitfalls we saw this year were use cases where people building these bots were overpromising what they could deliver the technology for an englishlanguage level conversation really isn’t there yet and that has plunged us into this trough of disillusionment that’s also a good place to be because it means that we’re getting real about what’s actually possible if 6 was the year of hype around this we could actually see a lot of real life useful tools and products emerge in the next yeardes it’s really convenient the way these things pick whole years in which they’re going to experience these iterations we see bots that pretend to be humans like “hi i’m barry the airline bot how can i book you a flight” and then you see bots that are blatantly bots like “i’m the little operator bot and i’m going to point you in the right direction” you said the idea of trying to humanize these bots isn’t something that we want to do at intercom but what’s the general thinking therethe degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end useremmet our thinking has actually evolved a lot as we’ve tried out a lot of the experiments that paul mentioned initially the thing that seemed most obvious to me was “hey these are friendly little robots that can interact in your conversation let’s make them be tiny pixar characters” that’s not what resonated with the users that we put our early bot iterations in front of the nuance of tweaking a little bit of the language or the degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end user some of our early experiments had people saying “hey i’m ‘bot name’ i’m not a real person but i have a character” people didn’t like that at all because hey felt slightly duped by it they thought they were here to talk to a person if you can insert a level of automation and “hey i am an automated bot that’s here to speed up the process” then people can see the value in that and it doesn’t feel like a bit of a bait and switchdes we had a command line once upon a time “write in the exact word and you’ll get the exact answer” do you think people’s behavior changes when they know they’re talking to a bot do they still continue the formalities and the civility and the “hey i’m curious about…” or is it just like “flights please”paul for me this thing is a scale at one end of the scale is a command line interface where it’s clear that you’re talking to a computer people don’t actually in many cases turn around and ask themselves “what is a bot” there’s no actual common definition we in one of our blog posts said that a bot is a simple computer program that executes and then to emmet’s point you can give it a face you can give it a name and you can make it more or less humanlikeif the command line interface is one end of the scale at the opposite end is what facebook was trying to do whereby you didn’t know if you’re talking to a person or a bot and clearly there somewhere is the uncanny valley we didn’t get close to the uncanny valley we were far down the path of this is clearly a computer program the minute it started pretending it was anything other than a computer people reacted very negatively to itbots are most effective today when users know exactly what they’re interacting withdes so it comes down to honesty and transparencyemmet partially i also think part of the 6 exuberance from bots was around this sense of “check out this very simple use case that i made up screenshot and put in my blog post” and people with a sense for product said “wow that does seem like a real new simple way of doing things” then when you try and actually build these things you realize that typing human englishlanguage sentences to a robot isn’t how you want to interact with a robotif you give people a blank input field it leaves a lot of room for the person to be rude to the robot or type pseudocommands or friendly questions to them there’s an evolution of the input on the end user’s side that isn’t quite so englishlanguage based maybe some of that standardizes around how you might be given a set of precanned responses that you can send to the bot which is faster than typing a whole sentence it’s easier because you actually know what you can say to the bot which is another problem these blank input fields provide if i’m right about that it’s possible that that question of “what should your tone be when interacting with a bot” would go awaydes if you follow that thread all the way it’s hard to see how that doesn’t start to look like buttons that you click it starts to look like uiemmet the most salient characteristic of conversational ui is not necessarily that you’re typing raw text in at the bottom of the screen it’s that you have this back and forth log of commands it goes back and forth and there’s more ways of sending a command to the computer than typing it into the input field at the bottomdes and maybe there’s not a predetermined order the command should be received in and they would be in a form or something similarpaul right and to play at both sides there there’s also more ways than having this nice grid layout on a screen with a lefthand nav and a button at the bottom and all the other common ways in which we’ve come to expect products to workthe rise of systemsdes paul you spoke a lot this year about the idea that products should be thought of as systems rather than just a set of screens how has that played out a lot in 6 have you seen a lot of new systems emergepaul most people building software are actually building and designing systems already – they just may not necessarily realize it systems are these broad networks of things that are related and connected uber is a simple example uber is certainly not a software company and certainly not an app company uber is this ecosystem of drivers passengers inventory all sorts of things over time as that system emerged and evolved uber added things like surge pricing other parts of the system like price and availability and even where people drive – the whole thing changes you change one piece of the system and other the pieces of the system changeone example from this year that i use is nike their app was totally redesigned this year it used to be called nike running the redesign is now called nike run club that’s a sort of branding distinction it’s like “oh it’s a club there’s other people oh it’s a system all right there are connected things happening in here” if you go into the nike run club app now you can go on runs track your mileage all the normal stuff that running apps have but they’ve paid a lot more attention to the system of runners – runs with other people meetups in different cities your running shoes nike had a lot of these components but they’ve certainly doubled down on an idea that this is actually a broad ecosystem far beyond the app the app is a conduit to other things happening in real lifedes what about from the design perspective emmet have you seen any new things emerge in this regardemmet airbnb went through a similar transformation this year the objects or actors in that system used to be things like guests and hosts and housing accommodation now they’ve added trips very much broadening their scope one would assume they’ve had to evolve their underlying system to cater for these new things that they’ve added that suggests to me that the system will tend to expand as new uses are demandedif you looked at the instagram app earlier this year the big button in the bottom middle would open your camera and you would post that to your stream now they’ve added stories and almost flipped what they’re about now the button at the bottom is to upload a photo you’ve taken before that’s your curated feed honestly it’s probably what instagram was always aboutsnapchat is the possibly unfair hard to avoid comparison when you look at how instagram has evolved their system snapchat in itself is an interesting example because they came from a very chaotic place earlier in the year and they seem to be rationalizing a lot of concepts you could say that instagram and snapchat are meeting in the middle having come from very opposite placestargeting existing behaviorsdes instagram started with a very clean system it was very obvious you had your own stream and other people’s streams and that was it snapchat started from frankly who knows where it was the most aggressive disrespect of systemic standards of software i heard it argued a while ago that snapchat’s an unconventional ui was actually part of it’s genius – it made the product somewhat viral because everyone had to teach each other how to use snapchatsnapchat themselves have had a interesting year aside from blowing up they also released hardware for the first time they took a really different approach from the likes of apple who are trying to get people to either replace or start wearing a watch or google glass who are trying to get people who don’t wear glasses to wear glasses google actually had nothing to offer people who did wear glasses which left them in a difficult situation snapchat said “screw all that let’s just sell some sunglasses” to me that approach lines up because they’re targeting an existing behavior sunglasses with a better product that is usually how good products happen how do you see itpaul my take is pretty simple these products are attempts at major breakthroughs for how people live and act and the ones that are successful don’t necessarily try to change people’s behavior they understand how people behave act and think and the new thing that emerges is congruent with thatthis idea of building bridges to the future was very prevalent when i was at google things like google glass and google wave these were products that didn’t really build bridges to the future they were so different and forced people to act in totally new ways people just didn’t know what to do with them whereas snapchat’s glasses are sunglasses and that’s it they’re sunglasses with a camera and people wear sunglassesif you actually watch the launch video for snapchat’s glasses above it’s not people flying around on skateboards it’s literally a shot of normal life except they’ve different sunglasses on google glass’s video had all this augmented reality it was like a science fiction movie it’s obvious to me that the winners are the ones who don’t try to radically alter society from the getgodes the bridge is the right concept for that snapchat could roll out a next version with a screen inside the lens that lets you see filters applied but obviously they have to get therepaul look at the development of the horse to the car the very first things that emerged were basically horseless carriages you can actually see a step by step progressionthe winners are the ones who don’t try to radically alter society from the getgofastforward to today and look at tesla the tesla car doesn’t need to look like a car it doesn’t have to have an engine at the front the chassis is the mechanics of the car but it still has something that looks like an engine and something that looks like a trunk that’s because people need this bridge they’re not going to buy a tesla if it looks radically different to a caremmet i wonder if this bridge to the future concept is especially true for consumer products where no one wants to seem like a weirdo on a pseudofuturistic thing the car is an interesting example if you think about a thing that’s likely to somehow achieve mass adoption at some stage over the next ‘x’ years it’s selfdriving cars there will be a gradual acceptance of the general public to selfdriving cars and your willingness to take your hands literally off the wheel and trust the computer because that’s a consumer use caseif you think about selfdriving trucks fundamentally the same product i would anticipate there will be an almost overnight switch as soon as it becomes possible from a regulation point of view mostly from a bottomline finances some cfo of a massive company is going to make the switch overnight to selfdriving trucks and likely the entire industry will follow within a very short amount of timeshifting from product launch to iterationdes you both spent a lot of the year working on our new educate product which is intercom’s take on a knowledge base the product’s launched and we’re in a different mode what happens after launch for a teampaul it’s been fascinating because the mode the team needs to work on almost the minute after the product launches is different to the one that they had before launch this happens overnight in the lead up to launch design decisions are antagonized over for a long period of time but they’re at some point locked down it was like “do not open this conversation again do not increase the scope of this thing narrow narrow narrow narrow get down to the hit list knock it off knock it off knock it off no opening up of old things”the minute we launched suddenly that all goes away and everything’s on the table again it’s the nature of all software that when you launch something you’ve got loads of stuff wrong loads even if you’ve run a great beta suddenly every single decision you made is up for debate again it’s very hard to suddenly accept that we might change it all and do it all a different way and iteratea sign of a great product team is not what they ship in their version  it’s version emmet there’s almost a tendency to become more conservative you’re thinking “we got it working we finally got past the finish line” and now some people are using it and liking it you have to be extremely brave at that point and say “there’s a huge amount of input and information that we didn’t have before” a sign of a great product team is not necessarily what they ship in their version  it’s that version  that’s when you really see how great a product team operates and thinks how agile can they be in adapting to the new world where the rubber hits the road and their product is out there and they’re getting feedbackpaul instagram impressed me in its early years because of it’s simplicity i was at facebook when instagram was acquired and the instagram team was incredibly disciplined there was pressure from all over the industry to add this or that especially the minute facebook acquired instagram “why doesn’t instagram have this feature if facebook does and facebook knows it works they should just add it” the team was incredibly disciplined to keep instagram really simplea lot of instagram’s success in the early years was because it was so accessible and simple to understand and they stuck to this core use case credit to them as snapchat has moved the industry on they’ve been able to adapt and that is the sign of a great team a team that can changedes they both represent proof that you do not need a large product footprint to have insane engagement they’re both relatively small product footprints they have managed to get stronger better more engaging and more addictive without actually adding  more screens or  more workflows which is stock bb saas philosophywhat’s to come in des we’re going to do a lightning round so short answers here voice as a user interface will it be relevant in paul absolutely hugeemmet no doubtdes relevant in bb as wellemmet too early to saydes conversational commerce – overhyped absolute bullshit very meaningfulpaul not overhyped definitely a big deal and probably has a bad namedes conversational commerce is way too broademmet it still holds great promise for very specific use cases but if you expect that all of commerce will move into your messenger you’re probably sorely mistakendes virtual reality – will it be relevant in bb and bc in emmet too early i’s time has come for gaming and that’ll be exciting to see what the possibilities are it doesn’t feel like all the pieces are there yetdes worst trend in product design todayemmet the silver bullet mentality whether it’s conversational commerce today bots throughout this year or shiny buttons fifteen years ago there’s always something and you’ve got to consider whether it’s a trend or an actual new building blockpaul ai no one actually can define agreeably what ai even is when most people say ai they mean if then this that statements just take some humble pie and agree that we’re not there yetdes what was your favorite new product of 6 and whyemmet i have a very unsexy answer for this – the belkin wemo light switch which has removed this very small but noticeable friction from my every night of shutting off all of the lamps around the room at google there used to be this concept of does a product pass the toothbrush test would you use it at least a couple of times a day this removes a very tiny thing but if you can make a tiny improvement a couple of times a day in every day of your life that’s decent i will say that from a product point of view it’s still a total mess there’s actually no system behind how home automation works to really tie it together so you have to sellotape all the bits togetherpaul one of the most ingenious amazing inventions of the past year was tesla’s roof tiles don’t put these big panels on your house just make tiles that do that instead it harks back to the idea of building a bridge to the future would you rather put this foreign looking scifi object on your roof or just swap out your tilestesla’s roof tiles give users a solar option without requiring a radical change in behavioremmet if you want to consider a system of interacting elements the ultimate example must be elon musk’s zoomedout plan where one of the things he needs to put in place to get humanity to mars is better roof tiles like who would have thought right but all of these interlocking strategies of these companies fit together to meet his ultimate goaldes i’m going to bring it back way down to earth and say my favorite product of 6 has been bear the notetaking app biggest lesson you’ve learned about product building in the past yearpaul we’re a company that has valued getting value out to customers as fast as possible scoping small but we did three big projects this year each at the time was actually the biggest projects in our history our smart campaigns launch in may our new messenger in august and then educate in december i learned that you shouldn’t do three big projects all at the same time because it’s just really hardemmet i would agree specific to our own experience doing those three big projects in the year but when you’re taking on that amount of work you have to figure out where and when to sweat the details if you’re going to obsess over every tiny thing then you’re going to get almost nowhere it’s another one of those art versus science things – there’s no hard and fast rules but you get a better sense over time we taught ourselves that lesson of when to make that trade off many times this year when to let go and live with it for now versus when to make sure that you polish the hell out of one specific thingdes lastly what do you think will be most relevant in product design and product creation in the year aheadpaul as much as we’ve criticized bots in this chat i do think that in  we will see really really useful applications of … i’ll say bots but really it’s automation simple automation via conversational interfaces is one way to describe it i think we’ll see real applications of these things situations where computers are better than humans at doing things people need them to do and i think we’ll see a really quick maturation of the use cases for these bots shineemmet defining conversational commerce as sending texts to a bot is a bit narrow broaden it slightly and think “i’ve got a service and there are many many endpoints whether it’s an amazon echo a voice ui or facebook messenger” it’s systemlevel thinking when is the appropriate place to surface my functionality to someone do they want to speak or type or do something else that’s most efficient or comfortable for them think about your product as more of an ecosystem with many endpoints it could surface in many places and not just in messengerpaul the interesting thing is it reduces the idea of ui’s wireframes and screens to being like a window into a system that window will change over time as will watch interfaces voice interfaces and bot interfaces product folks should be thinking about systems not just because it’s cleaner but because it’s the best way to have sustainabilityemmet things like the taxonomy of the site and thinking about this as a structured entity are really important as an industry a lot of the attention in the past ten years or so as we became very mobilecentric went to one of screens and a small number of screens and unbundling functionality into very small apps i think we’re moving a bit back not back to where we came from but a lot of those skills that served us well when we thought about things like information architecture and products as abstract things will serve people well in this new worldpaul xai is a really interesting startup their main interface is email then there’s magic and their main interface is sms we were in a period where the mobile screen was the dominant pattern that everything else emulated from and we’re fast moving beyond that echo and alexa these things are taking off our world is going to look quite different this time next yeardes that’s technology for you thanks very much folks and thanks everyone for listening  comments hide comments related articles podcast intercom’s karen church on product
