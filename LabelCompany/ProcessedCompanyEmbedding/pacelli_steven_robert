joining me today are steve pacelli our executive vice president of strategy and corporate development and kevin sun our vice president of finance and interim cfo before steve dives into a more detailed financial update let me highlight a number of recent positive developments here at dexcom since our last call only two months ago first in terms our sales performance the quarter came in consistent with our expectations with revenue growing  over the first quarter in  our cgm first message continues to resonate again in q of this year new multiple daily injection or mdi patients drove our growth that represented the majority of our new us patient additions estimated at just above twothirds of our new patients for the quarter second as we discussed on our last call we received a nonadjunctive indication from the food and drug administration near the end of  making dexcom g mobile the only cgm system approved for therapeutic decisionmaking shortly after fdas decision medicare issued a positive ruling for therapeutic cgm and then late in q we received additional coverage details from the regional macs confirming that all people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy will be covered under this ruling this includes people with type  and type  diabetes we have always believed that all intensively managed patients should have access to cgm regardless of age and we hope to leverage the medicare coverage criteria to our commercial relationships so far patient interest has been outstanding we currently have over  perspective new medicare patient opportunities in our pipeline and this is before we have even started promoting medicare availability we commend cms on this decision and while we are still early in establishing the framework to serve these patients in a streamlined manner we are excited to begin rolling this out to seniors who we believe will benefit tremendously from this technology i will provide more on timing later and finally were beginning to see good initial uptick in germany following our positive reimbursement decision there last year although were still early in adoption curve germany helped fuel  ous growth in q with that i will now turn the call over to steve for a review of our financials after which i will expand on these accomplishments and provide a general business update steve steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc thanks kevin dexcom reported revenue of  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the same quarter in  a  million or  increase sequentially revenue for q was down approximately  this reflects the seasonality we have experienced in the past several years as our us patients face resetting insurance deductibles at the beginning of the calendar year in addition because of the january cms ruling were prohibited by law from balance billing our existing cashpay medicare eligible patients which we estimate accounted for approximately  million to  million in lost sales during the quarter as kevin mentioned there is a lot of excitement around the cms ruling and our sales channel is experiencing a significant amount of noise in the field which has not yet translated into revenue during q we also saw a good uptick in our international business this led to a slightly lower global sensor asp to a greater mix of distributor revenue outside of the us finally we saw new weaker – weaker new patient additions from our pump partners which kevin will touch on later our first quarter gross profit was  million generating a gross margin of  compared to a gross profit of  million and a gross margin of  for the same quarter in the prior year our gross margin came in slightly below our anticipated range for the quarter due to a few factors obviously gross margin was impacted by seasonally lower first quarter sales and slightly lower sensor asps our hardware sales mix continues to shift toward our g mobile transmitter which has a shorter useful life and a lower asp and our warranty expense rate has stabilized but continues to run above historical levels exceeding  in q some final thoughts on our revenues and our gross profit our mix between durable and consumable products was within our normal historical range in q at approximately  durable and  consumable the asp for our hardware has remained stable and average sensor pricing came in slightly below  again due to geographic and distribution channel mix finally our international business showed continued yearoveryear growth generating  million in revenue during the quarter up  from last year and  sequentially this represents  of our total revenue research and development expense totaled  million for q of  compared to  million in q of  and up approximately  sequentially our key rd investments continue to make good progress these include the g pivotal study and related submissions with the fda as well as our advanced product pipeline investments in our verily partnership and the buildout of our data platform selling general and administrative expense totaled  million in q of  compared to  million during the same quarter in  with the increase primarily due to yearoveryear increases in head count in our field sales and customer support organizations including support for the initial phase of the medicare launch as well as a ramp in our patientfocused marketing expenses higher it costs and our ous expansion our gaap net loss was  million in the first quarter of  which included  million in noncash expenses consisting primarily of noncash sharebased compensation expense across all functional areas of our business consistent with our prior comments the sequential increase in our first quarter operating expenses included approximately  million in annual sharevesting payroll tax expenses and onetime charges associated with retirements severance and restructuring however total operating expenses came in slightly below our recent commentary primarily due to the timing associated with new hires as well as our directtoconsumer marketing campaign our gaap loss per share for the quarter was  absent noncash charges nongaap cashbased net loss was  million for the quarter we ended the first quarter with  million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet versus  million at the end of  during the quarter we drew  million from our credit facility to support our cash needs primarily to fund expenditures associated with the build out of our manufacturing facility in mesa arizona with respect to  guidance we continue to expect global revenue of  million to  million reflecting growth of approximately  to  we remain encouraged by our early progress with medicare and are beginning to work through the practical implementation of the cms ruling in the field were very confident that medicare will be an important component of our future business and kevin will provide more on our outlook in a moment for the full year we now anticipate gross margin to be at the low end of our guidance range of  to  due to continued ongoing warranty expenses as we transition to our new receiver and we continue to anticipate opex will increase  to  versus  on a gaap basis with that ill turn the call back to kevin for a business update kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc thank you steve life at dexcom continues to be very exciting the company achieved multiple historical millstones in the past several months and now its time for us to execute on them following our nonadjunctive claim late last year and the cms ruling in q our pipeline is at an alltime high were proud that the dexcom g mobile is the first and currently the only cgm system to be classified as therapeutic cgm we continue to believe these accomplishments are a direct result of the strength of our cgm platform both in clinical trials and in the real world in the us our recently expanded sales force is ramping up and will be critical in supporting our preliminary launch into the medicare market later this year our worldwide new patient additions met our internal projections as i mentioned earlier the estimated mix of our new mdi patients in the us is now consistent with the underlying type  market however we have experienced softness in the growth of our new pump patient additions as you are mostly likely aware our two commercial pump partners have encountered difficulties in recent quarters driven by a variety of factors however we see several highly competitive dexcomenabled insulin delivery systems both on the near and longterm horizons that will provide attractive options for the diabetes community outside the us our yearoveryear growth accelerated from fourth quarter levels buoyed by broader reimbursement in germany efforts in our two other direct markets the uk and canada and increased volumes throughout the european distribution channel turning to medicare nothing in this process has gone according to the standard plan a cms administrators ruling is incredibly rare and the timing of that ruling was completely unanticipated by us medicare certainly got this right for patients as this ruling should ultimately accelerate access to the eligible population however the joint article recently issued by the dme macs is something that is typically issued simultaneously with or after a coverage decision has been published so while the joint article provided guidance enabling patients to access this technology the formal absence of a coverage decision makes it very challenging to process claims in an efficient manner and not to take significant regulatory and financial risk by shipping to these patients hence the confusion and the delays at this point we are pulling every lever we have at our disposal and are speaking to medicare regularly it is also important to note that a change of administration and the stricter stance on new regulation can cause challenges we hope to resolve this as soon as possible longer term medicare represents one of dexcoms biggest opportunities in the intensive market we estimate that medicareaged type  population represents  of the overall type  market or as many as  patients in the us we also estimate that type  medicareaged patients on intensive insulin therapy represent approximately onethird of the intensive type  population or approximately  patients in the us again we have over  medicare eligible patients in our pipeline and we really havent done any promotions yet in the past year we have certainly made dramatic progress on the reimbursement and access front to put things in perspective with positive coverage decisions from both medicare and germanys gba we estimate that we now have an incremental of  million covered lives to target with our technology this roughly doubles the number of covered lives we had entering  globally our goal remains to continue to drive cgm towards a standard of care for diabetes management and we maintain our goal of achieving or exceeding an installed base of approximately  patients worldwide by the end of  now ill provide you with an update on our product pipeline with respect to our product pipeline we continue to have regular interactions with the fda we have received approval for our new more reliable test screen receiver and we will begin transitioning new patients later this year our discussions on the submission surrounding our new insertion system and corresponding transmitter are ongoing as we mentioned on our last call we are evaluating the implications of this filing on our commercial timelines considering the magnitude of launching a new applicator coupled with our g platform making very good progress well assess the timing of a potential launch of the new insertion with that of g as we move through the year on the app front we hope to launch our android platform in the us by midyear the majority of our g pivotal trial have concluded and our goal remains to file the g pma by the end of q  which would allow us to launch this product in  assuming a positive review by the fda we have very high expectations for g based on its impressive early data assuming this performance continues we expect patients will quickly appreciate what g means for standard and cgm performance even with a reduction in the number of daily calibrations in addition g represents the basis of our future nocalibration technology turning to our verily partnership our collaboration continues to march towards a continuous realtime low cost nocalibration disposable sensor system allowing us to target the nonintensive type  market in addition to the progress were making in product development we are beginning to explore a variety of commercial channels to support our nonintensive strategy as weve said in the past the business models we consider in the nonintensive market will likely differ from what weve pursued in our intensive business todate these include a shift to valuebased programs and working in collaboration with payers providers and employers to develop diabetes management solutions that leverage cgm and our data platform to facilitate both therapeutic and behavioral change considering the importance and costs associated with the broader type  patient population and healthcare management today these efforts are driving significant interest in solutions for this important category the noise in the type  diabetes market is only getting louder new drugs new programs all with different outcomes it seems like we have a new answer every week it is our belief that none of these offer the diabetes community as much value as cgm more specifically there is a tremendous void in the information provided to these patients to manage their condition the systems answer today is to take a pill eat less and exercise more patients have heard this three years and yet those ineffective treatments caused the system a fortune the opportunity lies with an approach that can not only provide better outcomes but the alleviate expenses for the first time accurate reliable and intuitive cgm data will provide payers providers and patients with realtime feedback about timing and efficacy of medications and how eating sleeping and exercise can impact their diabetes one of our early learnings is that cgm accuracy matters in the nonintensive market every bit as much as it matters in our intensive market many of these patients are truly interacting with their diabetes for the first time and they must have confidence in the data and information they receive our early pilot studies in the nonintensive type  space have demonstrated this with reductions in average glucose as well as improvements in ac time and range and glycemic variability over relatively short period of time once patients begin using cgm they quickly understand the repercussions of their decisions around both medication and behavior these benefits will ultimately drive significant cost reductions in the care of these patients from a product development perspective for these initiatives we believe our first verily device should be commercialized by the end of  and anticipate that the secondgeneration device will be available in the  timeframe turning to our partnerships we are making continued progress in our integrations of both g and g with advanced insulin delivery systems including pumps smart pens and other interconnected diabetes management platforms we will highlight more specific progress as these integrated systems approach clinical trials and commercial launch to sum things up dexcom continues to raise the bar in the cgm category in the near term we remain focused on driving awareness around therapeutic cgm and our recent positive reimbursement developments both with medicare and in germany in parallel we continue to develop our nonintensive strategy and are excited by the early signs of significant potential both in terms of product development and revolutionary new business models execution on our strategic pipeline will position us to maintain our position as the leader in cgm the dexcom team continues to perform at a very high level i want to take a moment to thank our employees for their continued efforts with all of the major milestones the companys achieved in the past few years we now have the ability and the mission to bring this lifechanging technology to a much greater number of patients id now like to open the call up for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and we have our first question our first question comes from mike weinstein of jpmorgan go ahead mike your line is now open michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon guys thanks for taking the questions let me just start with the us sales performance so it sounds like the inability to bill some of your cashbased customers cost  million to  million even if i adjust for that it looks like the us business was down  sequentially the last two years your us business was down  sequentially so can you give us some additional commentary on just the us revenue performance and then in there id like to follow up with the commentary you made about that backlog of  medicare patients can you just explain what that backlog is and how are you coming up with that number thanks kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well ill start with the backlog because thats very concrete once the coverage decision was announced we certainly have criteria when a patient comes in or goes to our website for creating what we believe is a patient opportunity or patient lead and these are patients who have met criteria who have shown enough interest and have enough of the criteria within our system to be qualified as patient lead so again there are more than  medicare patients in our system outside of the traditional patients that we have as well coming in through the field or coming in through our website and through the digital market space so these are again patients who have reached out to us and expressed interest and have enough information to qualify as someone is truly interested in cgm with respect to the us business and our growth yearoveryear i think one thing thats very important to remember is we were in the middle of the g mobile launch last year we launched it late in the first quarter could not meet everybodys need in the fourth quarter didnt meet all the needs in the fourth quarter and a lot of that carried over into the first so it is a tough us comparison quarteroverquarter with respect to our patient adds again pretty much like we had discussed before mike the majority of our growth came from mdi patients and we see the mdi patient base growing very quickly where we were down a bit where weve been in previous years on the new patient side was on insulin pumpers and we had fewer of those than weve had in the past with respect to reorders and patient behavior the other thing steve talked about and i can elaborate a bit on as well gets back to seasonality in the first quarter and possibly a changing nature in our patient base we have good reorders our patients called in that wasnt a problem but the bigger issue is deductibles and copays and particularly as we get into the mdi market our insulin pump patients spend a lot more money on insulin supply – insulin pump supplies than their pumps meaning deductible is faster than this new market in this group of patients that were seeing so we know that there is some financial pressure on these people we have not seen anything that would indicate increased attrition we have not seen anything that would indicate decreased utilization on the sensor first quarter is a tough seasonal one and those are really pretty much everything around the revenue numbers in the us michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc okay so you – well just go over few things so you reiterated your projections for the year on new patient starts and where your installed base would end up which was just going back to the fourth quarter fall was basically your patient adds are going to exceed your revenue growth in  you think your pipeline is an alltime high and youre reiterating your sales guidance for the year so two questions so one can you give us some sense on the second quarter what your visibility is today and how youre thinking about the second quarter versus the balance of the year because obviously there is some disconnect between how the streets modeling you guys and how youre thinking about it and then second can you just talk about how your expectations they have shifted to the positive on germany and that may be offsetting a little bit of incremental us weakness from your pump partners thanks kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well germany has been very successful for us while weve grown quite a bit in germany its still only about  of our total international revenue so its not as big as it can be we have contracts in place with less than  of the payers were sitting in front of two of the largest ones with contracts that should be executed shortly that would get us up to  of contracted reimbursement with the payers we have been contracted with we can process those claims and get paid but its very much oneoff and requires a lot of documentation so germany will provide us some significant growth opportunities going forward with respect to our estimates for the year and our pump patients there are a number of factors that we look at as we weigh this again we have our medicare situation we have a robust pipeline of potential new patients to serve without promoting it once we got this were excited we think we can add a number of patients there we think on the patient number front that would offset some softness on the pump side and possibly more than offset any softness on the pump side where the medicare model is a little bit different is the revenue we derive from a new patient when we add them and if i can give you an illustration you all know if we go back in time or if you look at a new patient the initial transmitters and a receiver and three sensors the hardware is between  and  and three boxes of sensors just for the sake of being simple lets say theyre  apiece or  so youve got somewhere between  and  to startup a new patient on the medicare side as youve all read the cms rulings were not going to get that big of an upfront payment we will be getting – us or our distributors will be getting rental payments on the receiver over a month period and the average payment per month on the disposable components would be somewhere between  and  so a new patient in that first quarter of use will bring us somewhere  to  so even if we grow the patient base significantly past the  if a number of them are medicare patients it wont have the immediate pop that weve experienced in our commercial business in the past as we look out as we look at the opportunities and the number of patients who continue to request cgm the number of new nonmedicare patients in our pipeline were comfortable with our guidance for the year in spite of all the other diabetes news that is out there and we plan on achieving those goals and second quarter typically for us has been up over first we certainly expect that it will be much better than the first quarter and well see how it goes from there steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah i mean mike on the other michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc yeah go ahead steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc just a quick kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc let steve  steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah just a quick addition on – you asked about q specifically and the sellside models i mean we certainly dont control the sellside models but what we said in our q call if you recall is we expected do somewhere between  and  of our annual revenues in the first quarter and i think where we landed was right square in the middle of that weve also typically historically said we expect to do  to  of our annual revenue in the first half of the year and so i think we would be comfortable sticking with that as a historical guide michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc understood and then last one and ill let some – ill jump and let everybody in  just want a comment on kind of what you think the feedback has been so far in g in terms of how thats pairing with the early clinicians and patients kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well theyve put it on  people and my guess is they probably picked those  people specifically so weve heard some relatively good feedback weve also heard mixed reviews with respect to the complexity of the system and going out of auto mode and everything i dont think the book can be written on g till this has commercialized to a broad number of patients i would tell you on the pump front we do see – as is evidenced by i think what we heard on tamps  call that some doctors are waiting to see – before they put a patient on a pump – to see how g goes and this will be more applicable to a patient but in all reality pumps again are fouryear warranty cycle we believe that we can do very well with the pump patients that we have now as i said earlier our new patient adds on the pump side were slow and now its really the most negative thing that we saw in the first quarter so well just keep going from there and theres a lot of mdi patients who really can use cgm and we will focus on those guys and our other pump partners patients as well michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc understood ill let some others jump in go ahead operator thank you we have our next question from jayson bedford of raymond james go ahead jason your line is now open jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc good afternoon can you hear me guys kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah perfectly jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc okay just a couple of quick ones kevin i appreciate the explanation around medicare but what really needs to happen from here for medicare patients to access the technology kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc the most important thing that can happen next is a coverage decision and what a coverage decision does is it provides an explanation around the benefit criteria that have already been established for example in the documents that have been issued already it says a patient needs to be taking four fingersticks a day but we dont have any guidance as how to document that what the local coverage decision will provide is documentation requirements to document four fingersticks a day this is what you have to do same thing with the other criteria type  diabetes and the other things that are on that list also with the local coverage decision jason while under the current pronouncements of medicare you cant bill on a onebyone basis on claims weve processed a few medicare claims and our distributor has and theyve all been pretty much denied awaiting a coverage decision so we really need this coverage decision and then we can really open this up and get this process running smoothly that is the next obstacle and again i want to be very clear cms has been very progressive in helping us try and get this out the things that theyve done the last guidance they gave towards the end of the first quarter that was very much a positive step at least viewed as a positive step by us to outline the criteria to specifically identify type  and type  diabetes patients using intensive therapy and that did keep the ball rolling we need to get this local coverage decision and we are going for local coverage decisions as soon as possible and then we can really get this thing going thats the big holdup right now more than anything else jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc and kevin are we going to see a series of local coverage decisions or is it one national that can be overlaid on the local steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc again its more consolidated than that it may be more than one but it probably would be two up to a maximum of four so a little bit unclear jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc okay and when do you anticipate this to be put in place is midyear still a fair estimate steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc there was a cms webcast actually that happened earlier today and they said basically that its in process and they wouldnt give specific timing but it seemed like it would be sooner rather than later so were hopeful before the summer kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc certainly before the end of this quarter is what were hoping for steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc okay and last one on this topic is when the local coverage decision is in place is that when you kick in a more aggressive marketing effort kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc that is correct the last thing we want to do is to add another  patients to the  patients were not currently shipping and have them all frustrated so yeah we will aggressively go after that as soon as we get that local coverage decision jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc okay thanks i kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc were teed up were ready to go this isnt something that will require a bunch of time well get after it very quickly jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc okay ill jump back in queue and let some others ask thanks operator and we have our next question from doug schenkel of cowen  company go ahead doug your line is now open ryan blicker  cowen  co llc hi this is ryan on for doug thanks for taking my questions so youve talked historically about international asps being about  lower than the us on average is this still the case in direct markets or should we assume its closer to the us indirect markets and what are your expectation for sensor asps over the remainder of  steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah so what weve said is the pricing in germany is more reflective of our direct pricing in the us but remember germany doesnt represent – it represents an okay chunk but it doesnt represent a huge chunk of our ous business yet so the vast majority of our ous business is still through thirdparty distribution which is at a lower asp as we look to go direct in other markets i think youll see some pricing improvement versus through distribution but i will tell you give an example in one of our reimbursed markets we actually elected to lower the price slightly to drive sales to drive volume and its had a wonderful response particularly against some of the competition that is priced lower so were still evaluating how wed proceed ous but yeah i mean what youre seeing today certainly germany being the only big direct market is still more reflective of our us pricing ryan blicker  cowen  co llc okay so should we expect the – where asps were this quarter or around that we should expect it to be towards the lower end of your historical range for the remainder of  kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah this is kevin i think well get back up into the  range probably not towards  as the us volumes become a larger percentage of our business and the usinternational mix in q of last year was also similar to this in fact the international business doesnt really suffer the seasonality that we suffer in the us and many times q has been our biggest quarter of the year internationally now we certainly wouldnt want to that to be the way this year but as us business goes up and becomes a bigger percentage of the business again you will see prices naturally move up because of again just distribution channel shift and geographic shift ryan blicker  cowen  co llc okay thats helpful and then moving back to medicare you said on the q call that you believe within medicare penetration of the type  patients could exceed the broader market rate over the next few years what do you believe will happen within the intensively managed type  population thank you steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc all right specifically to medicare or more broadly speaking ryan blicker  cowen  co llc specifically to medicare but both would be helpful steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah i mean id tell you its still a bit of an unknown as kevin said in his prepared remarks we hope to leverage the coverage criteria the coverage language from medicare into the commercial side of the business i think its still a little bit of an unknown because our core commercial business is not – its not dominated by intensively managed type s due to a lack of coverage so were probably id tell you taking a little bit of a waitandsee approach but the numbers of patients are much much larger than the type  so i think it could be extremely additive over the next several years kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah and with respect to the type  market again from a patient profile these are patients many of whom who suffer from hypoglycemia unawareness and this a wonderful tool to help them and help give their families peace of mind so we see a tremendous opportunity here and if we didnt see a tremendous opportunity here i can tell you its emphasized because it would appear to me that most of the medicare cash patients who we didnt ship have all sent me emails regarding the fact that they dont have their product and they want it soon so this is a group thats been very committed to the technology and done extremely well so i think we have a wonderful opportunity here the key for us will be executing streamlining the reimbursement and shipment process as we have to bundle this with the strips and meters upfront and making sure the patients are properly trained and qualified and weve staffed up for that weve added more people on our tech support group and on our patient care team and in our processing team in anticipation of this so weve done some things much better than we did a year ago weve put good plans in place to anticipate this and were just really excited to get started but getting started is the key word we really need to go operator we have our next question from jeff johnson of robert baird go ahead jeff your line is now open jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc thank you guys good afternoon so let me ask i guess one other medicare question so if im looking at the noridian coverage decision from late march the wording is pretty clear in there that youll only get coverage if youre using the dexcom receiver to display data and in fact i think in that document the word only is capitalized and then it goes on to say that if a beneficiary uses a smartphone as the display device the supply allowance will be noncovered by medicare so i guess my question is liberty recently decided theyre no longer going to process g orders at least and im not sure if thats temporary or not but is there any connection between that and the display wording is there any risk that the payers take if its found out that the patients are using their phone do patients take any risks do you guys have to change the share functionality on medicare or medicare patients it just seems like a big issue tied to this word only and im just trying to figure out if theres anything there to be thinking about kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc excuse me this is kevin ill take that what is lost on many of us is were about a year ahead of where we thought wed be with respect to this medicare stuff and in order to get dme approval we had to have a durable component of the system that would last a specific period of time that we would cover and working with medicare again they worked very hard and they determined that durable component is the receiver so well start with the rules that we have as far as liberty concluding this they have absolutely nothing to do with their decision and with this and that is by far and away the least important gaining factor in doing this libertys decision and as weve looked at this and quite frankly spoke with other distribution channels not knowing exactly what the coverage decision looks like and not knowing what youre going to have to have in your file to get paid when you have a medicare license at risk and your business is very much medicareoriented is something of a risk that liberty just wasnt ready to take at this point in time even though they could get paid on individual claims and go through the process and do a lot of work so they stepped back and theyre waiting – they want to wait for this local coverage decision as much as we do once this becomes clear well determine how to best proceed and i think its important for everybody to understand this has been a onetime thing this has been a process over several years and while we may sit here today with that position on the receiver being the durable part and being kind of like the centerpiece and the most important component of the system we have a number of options here we can certainly work with cms over time to see we can move it to another category we can also go back to what we did in the past with share and have the receiver talk to the phone and we could – but certainly we dont have that product in our portfolio right now but since we were the first to make it way back when we know how to do that so we have a number of options here we just need to let this play out we need to get this technology on patients we need them to explain how it has changed their lives and how beneficial it is and we need to be pleased with where we are and not get too crazy i dont think thats over time going to be a factor jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc thats helpful can i ask one clarifying question kevin earlier you mentioned the supplies reimbursement monthly limit of  to  and just as im thinking about my medicare model for you guys i thought the number would come out at  am i wrong on that and just wondering where your  to  kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc the receiver rental jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc got it yeah kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc was that payment for the first  months thats why i have that and then again what we end up getting will depend upon the distribution channel and our terms with distributors and well have more color on that once we start going in future quarters jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc yeah very helpful thank you operator and our next question comes from kyle rose with canaccord go ahead kyle your line is now open kyle william rose  canaccord genuity inc great thank you very much for taking the question can you hear me all right kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah kyle william rose  canaccord genuity inc yeah so just wanted to ask you just more on the pump partnership side has the disruption in that side of the market changed how you guys think about the longterm opportunity of where partnership should look whether itd be pump partnerships versus smart pens versus connected health obviously when you think about the type  opportunities just trying to understand how you guys view some of the value of those longerterm partnerships steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yes ill take that one kyle no i dont think it changes our thinking on that at all i think there is an extremely important segment of the market that well look to have to utilize these semiautomated or hybrid closed loop systems and we remain active with folks who you know with insulet and some others and there are some others that you dont know i think those are critically important to some subset of the market we also think as you mentioned smart pens a smart pen paired with a cgm we think as an extraordinarily compelling – a compelling product offering particularly when you think about the power and computing power that we have on the phone and being able to really mimic using the algorithms that would be the similar algorithms that youd have on the pump on the phone and actually really provide detailed dosing assistance and other lives  to the patient but then if you really look out at the market thinking about type s more broadly speaking kevin gave some color on our initial thoughts there theres a much much broader opportunity even in the noninsulin taking patient population in type s and i think were starting to see some really compelling preliminary data that will marry up with the appropriate products as we continue forward with our verily relationship so i dont think our partnership strategy has changed in fact i think our partners are becoming frankly more important perhaps more diverse were not just going to focus on closed loop or hybrid closedloop systems i think there is a broad spectrum of partnership product opportunities for us but theyre all going to be critically important over time kyle william rose  canaccord genuity inc great and i appreciate that and then just – a twopart question and then ill hop back in the queue just wanted to see is it fair to think of the product cadence – and i appreciate the color – but just the product cadence coming as g and then verily g and then the verily g and i dont mean to imply that thats not a very robust pipeline but im just trying to understand if we may see some incremental launches whether that be different labeling different types of used cases for those products along the way as we think about  to  to  time period and just second question is anything you guys want to highlight when we think about heading to ada in june kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc let me start with the product pipeline on the product pipeline front its a real good question and a very good observation we have been very successful over time once we get a technology platform established on the sensor side to turn that into enhanced performance and other different opportunities and i think in todays software world and with the expertise were developing and the expertise quite frankly at some of these important partners that steve has talked about is i think you will see derivations of our core technologies we tend to speak to our core technologies on these calls but i can give you a simple example weve certainly run feasibility studies on the gen  sensor for  days not only for purposes of the verily first product that were going to launch because it will be a g sensor but also for possibly a day version of g but all this is in feasibility phases were giving all these things thoughts and you will see iterations that will be different i think the other place that we can iterate that will be very meaningful will be software we believe once we have that accurate stable industry standard sensor platform and algorithms that generate extremely accurate and well performing numbers that we can then in future worlds come up with possibly different apps that might be approved for different labeling and might have different use cases for patients and back to what steve talked about with our type  business models and our type  relationships so there is a lot going on and there is a lot more going on here than just the – we talk about really the core basic things on these calls there are many other projects and many others things were considering along with those and with respect to ada certainly there will be talk about the second phase of the diamond study the type  diamond data and we have several technology papers there will be posters we have a couple of oral presentations we dont have a new product coming this year we would love to be able – knock on wood if we could launch android at ada that would be a wonderful event but were not there yet so itll certainly be a good show for us it always is and well have a great time here in san diego kyle william rose  canaccord genuity inc thank you very much for taking the questions operator and our next question comes from margaret kaczor of william blair go ahead margaret your line is now open margaret this is the conference operator if youre on speakerphone could you please pickup the handset or unmute margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc yeah sorry about that can you guys hear me kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah we can margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc perfect thanks so the first question for me in terms of the final pieces for medicare once theyre in place how should we think about the ramp of these patients are you continuing to see that pipeline of patients grow even now as we go couple months beyond the initial announcement and i guess more specifically over what timeframe should we look at those  patients to come online kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well certainly we want to get the  patient up and going as quickly as possible i think the medicare ramp once this final coverage decision is in place can go relatively quickly as we qualify these patients and make sure they meet all the criteria and understand what documentation then we have to have the impact of the patients though as i described earlier is a little different than our regular new patients just based on the reimbursement model on the fact that we get a monthly rental rather than the big upfront payment so our relationships with distributors are going to be a little bit different where the medicare revenue really becomes material and significant is when we get like a  or  patient base and were billing them all that monthly charge and so youve got a regular monthly revenue stream combined with monthly shipments that we think can be highly predictable so like i said a new medicare patient upfront is probably about half of what a commercial patient is in our upfront revenues but as that bolus goes out over time those patients become extremely valuable to us so its going to be a little bit different model but it will be highly – were very excited about it and we think it will be very additive to our business margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc and are those pipeline of patients still growing beyond the  kind of the rate over the period kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yes well we are still getting people calling in and wanting to join the pipeline we get many opportunities per day but when they hear we cant serve – we cant ship them yet its been a little bit difficult i would say that we really need to turn on the faucet once we get the coverage decision margaret and then well have a very good idea as to how robust these patients who have inquired is and how many will convert and how they use it we really need to get going margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc got it and in terms of the second question on the us patient adds is there anything that you guys can do in the near term to help maybe your existing pump partners improve those patient adds and steve i dont know if you have the numbers or willing to share but what percentage of your patient adds in the past have been through those pump partners last year versus what you guys saw this quarter steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc well its not – i wouldnt say its just pump partners i mean what weve said is historically this is two years three years ago we were – a typical quarter we would add roughly  pumpers which included animas tandem not just integrated – dexcom integrated systems but pumpers broadly speaking so animas tandem insulet kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc and medtronic steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc and even medtronic and so with the couple of pump partners that were seeing just not adding new patients generally speaking weve seen a slowdown so the point though is that while that did have an impact we have shifted the mix pretty dramatically over the last  months or so so now in a typical quarter were adding twothirds of our new patients are actually mdi patients so while its had an impact its not crippling the business we just drew attention to it because it was a factor in the quarter kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc its a factor yeah margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc got it and then last one from me maybe as we think about the g label kevin what could dexcom offer patients in exchange for that hard shutoff on the sensor whether its  days i think you mentioned  days that youre thinking about what would make them excited about that prospect and effectively pay more per day per sensor than they do today kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well the day life for g the way g is configured theres not a hard shutoff on g as we are filing it at this point of time and we will evaluate that hard shutoff up feature going forward we all read the blogs on our system and every time i get on the dexcom g user group pretty much every night somebody says hey i just got my dexcom and i wore my sensor for two weeks how much longer is it going to last and what do i do to make it last longer and then you read – the last couple of weeks ago i heard somebody said yeah i get  days for each of my sensors or seven weeks per sensor and here is all the things that i do so this is a feature we have build into our products i mean our product has been very reliable for more than seven days i think over time the way our model works particularly as you get out to  or  days if we were to shut it off it would be – i mean absolutely for quality purposes and to make sure that its accurate in particular with our noninjunctive claim and the way we would look at that margaret in all reality well were billing somewhere between  and  a day in the us to the reimbursement entities if we did shut the thing off hard we would make sure we repair with the patients because we always do and we would have a program to whereby patients – we would hope patients would not be hurt economically and its something we will study and explore all the time and give it lots of thought and consideration so it will be an interesting evolution on our technology curve and we have a lot of things to think about and consider margaret m kaczor  william blair  co llc good thank you operator and we have our next question our next question comes from danielle antalffy from leerink partners danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc thanks so much guys thanks for taking the question just a question on the competitive landscape dont want to belabor this but kevin id love to hear your thoughts on another competitor expected to come to market at some point later this year the abbott libre and theyve added a significant number of patients internationally what im really looking for is maybe your view on how the us market the dynamics there are different than the international markets where you compete headtohead with them and therefore why the competitive landscape when they do come to the us might be different than we what we see internationally kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well one of the first things to note international us versus libre is when libre started our entire international team consisted of three people and so we really hadnt built much infrastructure over there and we didnt have any reimbursement and decision for a patient was very simple pay cash for libre which is much less expensive than a dexcom system so adding cash patients with that low price point upfront led to some significant growth as steve alluded to earlier and i can validate again as we have received reimbursement in some of these european geographies a reasonable number of our patient adds are a libre users who arent getting what they want from libre in the us markets again one of our biggest assets is our nonadjunctive claim that a patient can dose insulin off of the system and we believe people intensively manage their diabetes thats going to be an important feature and so we believe in the intensive market we can do well and the fact is – again even in europe where we dont have near the resources theyve had you just heard us talk about a  first quarter growth factor in europe and i mean in the ous markets for this quarter and in our reimbursed markets were doing very well so in the us i think there is a niche for this i think there will be people who want it i think in the intense world where we are now we can maintain our share with our connectivity our share features the android app the new technology we have coming in and really more important than anything else  our accuracy in the performance of our system that has been documented time and time and time again over time danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc okay kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc as we look at that market i assure you as you look at the verily products we will have products to compete headtohead with that in the nottoodistinct future that we think will be – thatll be extremely good danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc okay thats helpful and i guess another issue for libre might be what reimbursement looks like for that system but one more question kevin i have on the longterm outlook here from an opex perspective and not asking for guidance but just trying to think directionally youve talked about how the look of the business will have to change when you do have a type  product and just curious about how the run rate for opex might change can you drive leverage as you sort of shift the infrastructure and build the infrastructure for the type  market or should we think about just directionally speaking over the next two years as you get ready for that sort of negative leverage or at best flat thanks so much kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc i appreciate that youre talking really more about the commercial and the sga aspect of those expenses and its become very clear to us that this will be a different type of business model for us we cant have the oneonone ordering that we have now and walk patients through their dme benefits and the way that we do things its going to have to be different and we are exploring new business models that can do that as steve talked about earlier outcome based type programs that we can sell with employers payers communities and things of that nature thats going to have to be leveraged and its going to have to be done differently than what we do today and we think can leverage that and be successful and so we are taking as much time with the business model in this area as we are taking with the technology and the development of the business model is every bit as high tech and challenging and different as developing the technology is its really been a wonderful effort so far and youll hear more probably more towards late this year and early next year as to what thats going to look like for us danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc all right thanks so much operator and we have our next question our next question comes from david lewis of morgan stanley go ahead david your line is now open david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc thanks a couple of followups and some clarification kevin just on this topic and maybe steve actually i think youve answered this question but on the twothirds in the  mix if that mix holds at twothirds where it sort of has for the next several quarters youre still comfortable with your guidance im assuming because thats where its been the last several quarters you seem to have popped up a little bit but is twothirds mdi throughout the remainder of the year an issue or something youre comfortable with steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc no thats actually been a goal right i mean historically we were even with the endocrinology community people always – this is the old days but people used to characterize cgm as just an adjunct to a pump so we set out a number of years ago with our cgm first campaigns to show the world that cgm is the most important tool in diabetes management so if youre on mdi you can effectively manage your diabetes without going to a pump with mdi and cgm so no i think its actually – thats a huge positive for us david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc so i totally understand this steve i guess what im getting at is if that number were to go to  in the back half of the year do you have enough mdi momentum to offset the pump degradation steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc sure theres lots more patients on mdi i mean remember pumps are only about  penetrated in the us and less than  penetrated outside the us so theres tons more patients in the mdi group david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then kevin just or for steve guidance this year i mean no one was specifically asking but how should we think about the impact medicare is having on guidance should we still assume a very limited impact in your expectations for medicare was there any channel load at all here in the first quarter into your dme partners to speak of kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc no there is no channel room for us we monitor our distributors very carefully and no there is no channel out there with respect to the impact of medicare again – and even the impact of new patients and patient growth and thats a very good question in all reality as youre looking at a  millionplus business the number of new patients you can add in your quarter dwarfs what new patients could contribute three years ago to a quarter so the new patients are very important and medicare will have an impact but i dont think you can move the needle like  or  certainly over the back half of the year it can move it at a lower amount of that depending upon on how many patients that we have so well give you more guidance and color on that as we add them and were probably going to have to be very clear with medicare patient numbers on margins and breaking some of this out so everybody understands the story where it really moves the needle is in the periods going forward as you get a large established base with recurring revenues and we continue to shift to that business and it can evolve more over time than the upfront payments we get from new patients now david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then kevin just we get this question a lot from shareholders the last couple of weeks and months in light of this year with medicare libre g is it likely we get a guidance update earlier in the year this year based on those parameters or do those parameters actually make it a lot less likely you provide an update for the year into your more traditional period thanks so much kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc go ahead steve steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah no i mean we evaluate our guidance on a quarterly basis and at this point were not comfortable because were not shipping to medicare were not comfortable upping it we do think medicare is a huge opportunity and well evaluate it at the end of q which will – that call will probably happen a month after the end of the quarter kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc just where we sit today we just didnt feel conformable changing it yeah operator and our next question comes from tao levy of wedbush go ahead tao your line is now open tao l levy  wedbush securities inc great thanks good afternoon maybe some clarification questions in terms of the percent of the patients who are on g versus g is that a number that you guys can provide steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc no weve not broken it out but remember the disposable sensor is the same so with respect to  of our revenue it doesnt matter whether they are on g or g the only difference it makes to us financially as we noted in our prepared remarks is that the cogs on the tao l levy  wedbush securities inc transmitter steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc g transmitter yeah are a little higher tao l levy  wedbush securities inc right and so that has a decent size impact on sort of your hardware sales if you separate the two i mean hardware sales growth was reasonable this quarter up over  and kind of where you fell a little bit short at least versus my model was on the sensor side and what you had said on the call was youve got more international so that lowered the asp a bit and so my question is that that  million to  million related to medicare was that all sensor related or was any of that hardware and also what happen to that in the second quarter steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc i mean its much more sensor related these would be existing patients so not new patients i suppose there could be in that mix some anticipated transmitters if the transmitter died during the quarter but it would be predominantly sensor revenue tao l levy  wedbush securities inc got you and what happens in the second quarter with that  million to  million can you start charging for steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc so we havent been able to ship for cash these were excash pay patients and now that we have medicare coverage we cannot ship to them and charge them cash so once we have coverage – again back to once we have the formal coverage in place we can absolutely continue to service these patients there wont be a makeup per se tao l levy  wedbush securities inc right steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc because thats revenue that they would have – well start charging them – well start charging medicare for sensors and shipping sensors to them but there wont be a catch up tao l levy  wedbush securities inc got you and then just lastly from a sort of like a strategic perspective i think when the question around will you guys ever buy a pump company had come up in the past i think the response was no not really but if it did potentially have an impact on our sensor business not having a competitor of artificial pancreas or similar device then we – you guys might consider it is this kind of what were talking about here where your pump partners arent as quick to launch artificial pancreas technology that you try  steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah i mean i can cut you short no were not looking to buy a pump company i think we continue to evaluate our partnership relationships you could see us become a little more involved with one or more of the partners if some of them seem to fall off but at this point in time were going to continue with our partnership strategy again both on the pump side and on interconnected pens and other software platforms so not interested in buying a pump tao l levy  wedbush securities inc great thanks operator and our next question comes from joanne wuensch of bmo capital markets go ahead joanne your line is now open joanne karen wuensch  bmo capital markets united states thank you for taking the question can you hear me okay steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc absolutely kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc yeah joanne karen wuensch  bmo capital markets united states thank you so much okay other than sales force hires is there a way to sort of qualify or quantify the people that you have coming onboard and how are they spending their time largely and then the second question which is somewhat related you talked about  medicare patients coming in before you really do an outreach program towards them can you discuss what that outreach program might look like and the timing of when that might happen thank you kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well the outreach program will start as soon as we get a coverage decision in earnest and it will much more noisy it will be a combination of digital platforms well also – we have some tv ads that will run and other media programs very similar to what we do with our dtc campaigns today we have a very focused web all that type of stuff to identify and help these patients and so were going to do that one and thats when that will come sorry what was your other question joanne karen wuensch  bmo capital markets united states it had to do with the new sales force hires kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc sales reps okay joanne karen wuensch  bmo capital markets united states yup kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc so the new sales reps came onboard late last year and early this year the sales heads in the us were determined literally by dividing current territories and reassigning people within those territories i would tell you like any sales force reorganization there are some bumps some speed bumps along the way we are extremely happy with the quality of the people that we brought onboard and we had absolutely no shortage of people running these jobs who are very very qualified but it does take a while to get everybody up and running and we did experience that in the first quarter as well in the us dr jones in sun city  just lost their rep  to the new ones coming in and relationships have to be redeveloped and redeployed we believe our team is up and running and doing well and it does take a little while i mean we expanded  to  on the us side and so theres a lot of new people theyve all been trained theyve all been in for training weve had our national sales meeting and they should be ready to go and certainly very productive in the second quarter the way we analyze all our salespeople in the us so our key criteria is new patient adds and we evaluate everybody based on their new patient targets and are very thoughtful and deliberate as we set those up and get that done and so we watch everybody joanne karen wuensch  bmo capital markets united states thank you very much operator and we have our next question our next question comes from steven lichtman of oppenheimer go ahead steven your line is now open steven lichtman  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you hi guys so obviously a nice uptake in germany and that continues to build where are we in terms of cgm reimbursement in additional countries in europe i know youve talked about france and uk in the past kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc why dont you go ahead steve steven robert pacelli  dexcom inc yeah i mean were still working with the french authorities i dont want to be more specific other than were hopeful within the next  to  months we hope to see some reimbursement in france similarly in the uk weve submitted the appropriate paperwork and are having discussions with the national health service there were starting to see reimbursement but in a more limited fashion in some of the other countries in europe where theyre looking to provide a fixed amount of money for reimbursement were trying to figure out how we will play in some of those markets australia is starting to reimburse so were seeing it its happening certainly as quickly as we would have hoped steven lichtman  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great and then beyond the dosing claim you also had positive data obviously come through over the past few quarters through diamond how do you think you can leverage the diamond data sets with clinicians and with patients particularly as they get published kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc well i dont think that one certainly having a publish paper to take into clinicians particularly as they go back to the example steve gave and when i first started with dexcom going out in the field frequently when i would go into physicians office the first thing they would say to me im not giving a patient cgm unless theyre on a pump they have to be on a pump first and what the diamond study clearly shows is that is not the case that you can derive significant benefit being an mdi patient and wearing in dexcom cgm and id tell you as we have clinicians as we meet with clinicians and conduct symposium and educational programs across the country that attitude has changed the cgm first message is taking hold in that diamond paper is really the first thing weve ever had to document those outcomes we think it can also be helpful for us with payers over time as we look for lower cost solutions in managing patients with type  diabetes and intensive insulin using type  patients and we will use it for that as we try and expand our markets and our coverage and go deeper so its a very good start and the other data will be very helpful as well steven lichtman  oppenheimer  co inc broker great thank you guys operator and our next question comes from chris cooley of stephens go ahead chris your line is now open chris cooley  stephens inc good evening guys and thanks for working me in here in the queue just two for me one would you be willing to characterize the medicare pipeline in terms of which channel theyre primarily served in are they coming in primarily through the endo channel or are these patients that are being cared for by gps just trying to think a little bit about how frequently they visit their practitioner and then converting them over time once the coverage decision comes into place and then just as a quick follow up from a model perspective when the additional two payers come online in germany and youre up over  of the covered lives there should we think about incremental pressure to the global asp on the sensor side or is that already kind of factored into your prior comments thanks so much kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc as steve said earlier in germany our sensor reimbursement in germany is very similar to what we did here in the us so again as these payers come on in germany chances are it would have a positive impact if germany becomes a greater percentage of our international business as i said earlier its probably around  of the total ous right now so well just have to see how that goes with respect to referrals and physicians of our medicare patients were getting leads from two sources certainly online and online referrals the patients coming through our website and enrolling and those patients can have general practitioners and endocrinologists with respect to referrals from the field those are primarily coming from endocrinologists which is where our field teams spend the most of their time and if you go into an endocrinologist office at least when i go in as much as i want to talk about our pipeline and all the stuff thats coming in the future the first question i get every time is when youre going to be able to take care of my medicare patients so i think there is good pentup demand amongst endocrinologists to help that senior population chris cooley  stephens inc thank you kevin operator im showing no further questions at this time kevin ronald sayer  dexcom inc all right im going to wrap it up i want to thank everybody for their participation on our call today and your continued support of dexcom in preparation for todays call we noted that my first earnings call with dexcom was exactly six years ago today and we proudly reported  million in product revenue for the quarter not one weeks revenue for us going forward from now on its been a very fast and extremely rewarding six years driven by a tremendous amount of hardworking commitment from our team here think about the short list of industry first cgm performance that finally met patient expectations the first fdaapproved apps to allow patients to share data the first system ever to communicate directly to a phone the first device ever to be labeled to make therapeutic insulin dosing decisions and finally the first product to medicare at least in a few weeks or a few months we hope while this list is great and were very proud of all that weve done everybody here at dexcom would tell you that if you look out over the next six years that list is going to be much longer and much more meaningful as we drive the message of cgm as a standard of care for glucose measurement across the board i had an opportunity this past weekend to speak with an individual whose family has been greatly affected by diabetes at a recent jdrf gala here in san diego this person commented to me that while he is very generous and he is supporting diabetes research its dexcom that saves his children every night and he told me to be very mindful of that as we go forward in what we do well never forget that as we launch our new product platforms incorporate verilys high technology and truly merge hitech and midtech build out our new factory communicate and connect to more and more devices and expand into new markets over the next several years our commitment to patients will never change we truly want to enable people to take control of their diabetes thank you operator thank
