we believe in order to be successful over the longterm investors need a counterintuitive mindset  following the crowd will eventually lead to poor investment results  two of the best teachers of this philosophy are quoted belowin the stock market the only way to get a bargain is to buy what most investors are sellingsir john templetonbe greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedywarren buffettsuccessful longterm investing is not an easy process  one need look no further than the recent financial crisis of  to prove this point  the swings between greed and fear can drive investors to abandon their discipline at the worst possible momentgreatmark seeks to buy good companies when they are temporarily out of favor and when their stock prices are depressed  as a result of buying companies on sale and out of favor it rarely coincides with immediate gratification because we are focused on the longterm when we make the purchase we dont feel the need to obsess over what happens in the next  weeks or  months  partnering with a great business as an owner rather than a trader enables us to not be swayed in our conviction due to shortterm market fluctuations

our people services continuity why greatmark investing philosophy costs dividends stock buybacks patience portfolio activity own vs rent portfolio activity greatmark investment partners serves a vital role in helping clients manage the emotions of investing  markets are in large part driven in the shortterm by the emotions of greed and fear  one week an investor will feel like getting out while i still can and the very next week he will want both feet planted on the accelerator trying to make as much as we can  this swing in emotions will lead to overtrading a portfolio attempting to capture shortterm market moves  we believe trigger happy investors are much more prone to shoot themselves in the foot rather than being able to accurately time the emotional whims of an entire stock marketconsider that in a year period from  the average stock mutual fund posted an average annual return of  yet the average investor in those mutual funds only realized returns of   investors captured about half the actual return the funds produced due to the clients tendency to trade inout of the funds at the worst possible time as they chased performance or gave into fearinvestors desire to grab the gains while we can and avoid all the big declines leads to market timing and ultimately poor investing results  most end up buying near the top and selling out near the bottom  it also tends to lead to overdiversification  the average mutual fund has an  annual turnover meaning the average length of ownership for each stock is a little more than a year and  of the portfolio is boughtsold in one year and holds  stocks with no stock making up more than  of the portfolio  nearly  turnover doesnt indicate to us a patient longterm approach and it perhaps explains why so many actively managed funds have such a hard time beating the market  their clients are pouring money in near the top and yanking money out near the bottom  the portfolio manager of the funds overdiversifies to try and mitigate these risks and in turn neutralizes the portfolios ability to beat the marketgreatmarks turnover averages less than  a year implying an average holding period for

assets  your real estate brokerage accounts retirement plan assets and other assets  then we will review your debt  mortgages car loans business loans etc and well review your educational funding for childrengrandchildren  lastly well discuss your planning needs  retirement planning longterm health college funding plans to care for your parentsinlaws etcdebt  one of the major issues facing americans today is debt  we have helped a number of clients restructure their balance sheet to payoff debt as the first step in a new longterm financial plan  in some cases this means taking money away from portfolios we might end up managing to retire debt  we want to give you the best advice we can to help you achieve your goals even if it means we lose business  taking a longterm view helps a great deal  paying off a house or fully funding college needs provides great peace of mind and frees up cash flow for the next step of the financial planportfolio review  after the initial assessment and review of assetsdebt we will review all of your investment portfolios  this usually winds up in a consolidation of your investments into one location because most clients tend to have assets spread out all over the place  from stock certificates in your safe deposit box to old retirement plan accounts to a mutual fund held at the fund company to a brokerage account that formerly was managed and is now dormant  we will help you consolidate all these assets and eliminate a number of accounts  this helps at tax time by eliminating some of the s you must keep track of and it gives you a fresh start  oftentimes in this process we will find a number of small positions we can eliminate  shares that came to you via mergers or spinoffs or some hot stock bought a few years ago that didnt pan out  well clean up the portfolios and help get your investments focused into our agreed upon strategy going forwardtax sensitivity  we will be careful to manage the tax implications of major changes we make to your portfolios as we take over active management  well want to run ideas by your cpa and will work with them to make sure we are all on same pagecash management  we will help

required minimum distributions from your iras and we can withhold taxes and deposit the distributions via automated funds transfer directly to your checking account  many people keep too much money sitting dormant in the bank  well help you construct a strategy to get this money working for you while maintaining flexibility to meet your needsongoing monitoring  well keep track of your plan and monitor your progress and the cash cominggoing from your accounts to make sure the plan is staying on track  life happens and things change  the plan is not a onetime document but rather it is adjusted over time to meet your changing circumstances  we want to be your financial partner and we welcome your dialogue about your needs and changing circumstances  our management fee is
