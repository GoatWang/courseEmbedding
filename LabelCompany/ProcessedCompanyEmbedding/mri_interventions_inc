overview nature december  highlights dr paul bottomley and colleagues groundbreaking work in zeugmatography later known as mri reprinted by permission from macmillan publishers ltd nature magazine vol  no  copyright  mri interventions inc is a medical device company that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain and heart under direct intraprocedural magnetic resonance imaging or mri guidance since our inception in  we have focused on research and product development in the field of interventional mri from  to  we deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the foundational capabilities for enabling mriguided interventions and to build an intellectual property position in  our focus shifted to identifying and building out commercial applications for the technologies we developed in prior years we have two product platforms our clearpoint® system which is in commercial use is used to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain our cleartrace system which is still in development will be used to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures in the heart both systems utilize intraprocedural magnetic resonance imaging to guide the procedures both systems are designed to work in a hospital’s existing mri suite our products are designed to provide a new minimally invasive surgical approach for the benefit of large patient populations our clearpoint system is designed to enable the delivery of therapies to treat certain neurological diseases our cleartrace system is designed to deliver therapies to treat certain cardiac diseases we believe that our two product platforms subject to appropriate regulatory clearance and approval will provide better patient outcomes enable physicians and hospitals to treat more patients and reduce costs to the healthcare system advancing patient care  our product platforms are designed to enable physicians to see the target site guide the surgical instrument to the site deliver the therapy monitor for adverse events and complications and confirm the desired results of the procedure all under high resolution intraprocedural magnetic resonance imaging  providing care for more patients we believe that our clearpoint system may enable physicians to treat patients who otherwise may not be treated utilizing current surgical techniques  in addition by providing direct intraprocedural visualization we believe our clearpoint system could reduce the amount of time needed to perform procedures and enable physicians to treat more patients in a given period of time improving utilization of resources we believe that use of our products may result in more efficient utilization of healthcare resources and physician time our product platforms are designed to work in a hospital’s existing mri suite which adds additional utility for an infrastructure investment that has already been made by the hospital further we believe our intraprocedural visualization capabilities and streamlined workflows may increase procedure efficiencies mric key statistics  mri interventions inc financial ratios  marketwatch bulletin investor
