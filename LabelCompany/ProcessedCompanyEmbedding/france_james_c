cancel send × buy the print book information information contents metrics book description this major new textbook addresses fundamental questions about the nature of the state in early modern europe through an analysis of the most important continental state france professor collins abandons the traditional formulation of the absolute monarchy and presents in its place a state that evolved to meet the needs of the french elites collins offers a detailed analysis of french society to provide the broader context for the development of the french state the model that emerges from his synthesis is one that relied more on persuasion and congruity of influence than on arbitrary authority and collins argues that fundamental changes in french society made the monarchical ministerial state a dangerous anachronism by the s leading to political impasse by the second half of the eighteenth century collins offers a fundamental reinterpretation of the state relevant to historians and students of political thought reviews ‘the reader who savours the full pleasures of this book will be able to feel that he or she at the end of it all has a real grasp of both what happened in the old bourbon state and how it functioned changed and came apart one could scarcely ask more of an introductory work and one can only regret that more supposedly ‘introductory’ textbooks do not come up to
