violations against former ceo justin braunemarketwiredapril  reblogsharetweetsharelos angeles camarketwired  april    agritek holdings inc otc pink agtk httpwwwagritekholdingscom a leader in compassionate care technology and agricultural solutions for the recreational cannabis industry today announced that the company has sent a cease and desist letter to vape holdings inc and its ceo mr justin braune agritek holdings is preparing a law suit against vape holdings and mr braune for intellectual property infringement and violation of mr braunes employment agreement under noncompete clauses the cease and desist contends that the present vaporizer device and cartridge being sold as vape holdings revival vapes product line was designed and developed during mr braunes tenure as chief executive officer of agritek holdings under the companys wholly owned subsidiary prohibition products inc with mr braune as president of prohibition products the same exact device was developed and sold under the companys wwwprohibitionlifecom website and brandthe complete product video for agritek and prohibition life may be seen herehttpwwwcannabisfncomcfnvideoidnhbnuvthe company plans to outline in its suit for monetary damages and attachment of the revivalvapescom site revenues on the basis that all design prototypes marketing materials ecommerce web site and roll out strategy were blatantly taken and reproduced under a different name upon mr braunes unexpected resignation from agritek holdings the company will additionally show that mr braune and agritek management had previously negotiated an asset purchase of the prohibition device through letters of intent and purchase agreements drafted by vape holdings counsel entitling agritek to royalties and equity payments on each device sold the company further has all correspondence from the development of the device original prototypes and cartridges as well as a signed employment agreement clearly stating that any property designed or released during mr braunes term as an officer of agritek holdings shall remain the property of the companyagritek will be seeking the complete attachment of our device from vape holdings and all monies due to our company with regards to the revival vape products being sold by vape holdings we believe that the evidence is overwhelming against mr braune including signed letters of intent and asset purchase agreements for the purchase of our vaporizer along with his actions of resigning from the company and leaving agritek nonreporting for the first time in our history without a board and moving to vape as their new ceo with our technology in my opinion what we will show as evidence will prove to be damaging to himself and vape holdings we plan to pursue this to the full extent of the law and seek back all monies paid to mr braune and the development of the vaporizer device stated b michael friedman ceo of agritek holdings incabout agritek holdings incagritek
