the fasb issued asu  “intangibles — goodwill and other topic  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” the purpose of asu  is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the twostep impairment test the amendment should be applied on a prospective basis asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within that year early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january   the company does not expect asu  to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements          table of contents       in january  the fasb issued asu  “business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business” the purpose of asu  is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within that year the amendments in asu  should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date early adoption is permitted the company does not expect asu  to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements   in october  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic  intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” the update requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset upon transfer other than inventory eliminating the current recognition exception prior to the update gaap prohibited the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intraentity asset transfers until the asset was sold to an outside party the amendments in this update do not include new disclosure requirements however existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years the company does not expect asu  to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements   in august  the fasb issued asu  “statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” which clarifies guidance with respect to the classification of eight specific cash flow issues asu  was issued to reduce diversity in practice and prevent financial statement restatements cash flow issues include debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs settlement of zerocoupon bonds contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies and bankowned life insurance policies distributions received from equity method investees beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle asu  is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years under the provision entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable the company is currently evaluating the provisions of asu    in april  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing” the guidance clarifies two aspects of topic  i identifying performance obligations and ii providing licensing implementation guidance while retaining the related principles for those areas topic  includes implementation guidance on a contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and b determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property which is satisfied at a point in time or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property which is satisfied over time the amendments in this update are intended to render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation of reducing the degree of judgment necessary to comply with topic  the fasb continues to clarify this guidance and most recently issued asu  “principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” asu  “narrowscope improvements and practical expedients” and asu  “technical corrections and improvements to topic  revenue from contracts with customers” these new standards have the same effective date as asu  and will be effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the cumulative catchup transition method the company has not yet determined which method it will utilize the company has formed a committee that is evaluating the potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to the current accounting policies and practices based on this initial assessment and the actions the committee is currently undertaking to implement the new guidance the company currently believes that the adoption of topic  will primarily impact its wholesale operations segment in the timing of recognition of certain adjustments that are currently recorded in net sales along with reclassifications of certain operating expenses such as cooperative advertising which is currently recorded in selling general and administrative expenses but will be recorded as an offset to net sales under the new guidance the company believes that the retail operations segment will not be materially impacted by the new guidance as its retail stores do not currently offer significant loyalty programs to their customers however these assessments may be subject to change   in february  the fasb issued asu  “leases topic ” the primary difference between the current requirement under gaap and asu  is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases asu  requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term other than leases that meet the definition of a shortterm lease the liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments the asset will be based on the liability subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs for income statement purposes the fasb retained a dual model requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance operating leases will result in straightline expense similar to current operating leases while finance leases will result in a frontloaded expense pattern similar to current capital leases classification will be based on criteria that are for the most part similar to those applied in current lease accounting asu  may be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients transactions will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented the guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the company is currently assessing the potential impact of asu  on its consolidated financial statements and expects that it will result in a significant increase to its longterm assets and liabilities   in january  the fasb issued asu  “financial instruments — overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” this standard modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value          table of contents       of financial liabilities simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment changes presentation and disclosure requirements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to availableforsale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early application is permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this asu will have a significant impact on its statement of operations    item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   unless the context otherwise requires

number of men’s categories as well as in home and jewelry we believe that our strong track record of driving organic growth identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout

continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than  years   in july  we signed a threeyear extension through march  of our license agreement with the national football league this

universities in july    we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution for a wide array of products at a variety of price points we believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will seek licensees with a successful track record of expanding brands into new categories it is our objective to continue to expand our product offerings and we are continually discussing new licensing opportunities with brand owners   licensing   as we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands we have licensed these brands in categories outside our core competencies we began licensing andrew marc vilebrequin and gh bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in   and  respectively our licensing program is expected to significantly increase as a result of owning the donna karan and dkny brands   the dkny brand is currently licensed for a broad array of products including fragrance watches hosiery intimates eyewear children’s clothing home furnishings and menswear we intend to focus on the expansion of licensing opportunities for the dkny brand while also reestablishing dkny jeans donna karan and other associated brands we believe that we can

our retail partners including macyscom nordstromcom and others each of whom have significant online businesses we have also increased sales to pure play online retail partners such as amazon fanatics and others we continue to develop additional marketing initiatives over the internet our web sites and social media to increase our ecommerce presence   trends   significant trends that affect the apparel industry include retail chains closing unprofitable stores an increased focus by retail chains on expanding their ecommerce the continued consolidation of retail chains and the desire on the part of retailers to consolidate vendors supplying them   retailers are seeking to expand the differentiation of their offerings by devoting more resources to the development of exclusive products whether by focusing on their own private label products or on products produced exclusively for a retailer by a national brand manufacturer retailers are placing more emphasis on building strong images for their private label and exclusive merchandise exclusive brands are only made available to a specific retailer and thus customers loyal to their brands can only find them in the stores of that retailer   a number of retailers are experiencing financial difficulties which in some cases has resulted in bankruptcies liquidations andor store closings the financial difficulties of a retail customer of ours could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a retail customer experiencing financial difficulty that could result in higher reserves for doubtful accounts or increased writeoffs of accounts receivable we attempt to mitigate credit risk from our customers by closely monitoring accounts receivable balances and shipping levels as well as the ongoing financial performance and credit standing of customers   sales of apparel over the internet continue to increase we are addressing the increase in online shopping by developing additional marketing initiatives over the internet our web sites and social media   we have attempted to respond to trends in our industry by continuing to focus on selling

license agreements entered into by us that added to our portfolio of licensed and proprietary brands and helped diversify our business by adding new product lines expanding distribution channels and developing the retail component of our business we believe that our broad distribution capabilities help us to respond to the various shifts by consumers between distribution channels and that our operational capabilities will enable us to continue to be a vendor of choice for our retail partners   results of operations   three months ended april   compared to three months ended april     net

rate of  per annum the abl credit agreement is secured by specified assets of us and certain of our subsidiaries   in addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the abl credit agreement we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the abl credit agreement with respect to the unutilized commitments the commitment fee accrues at a rate equal to  per annum on the average daily amount of the available commitment   the abl credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict our ability subject to specified exceptions to incur additional debt incur liens sell or dispose of assets merge with other companies liquidate or dissolve giii acquire other companies make loans advances or guarantees and make certain investments in certain circumstances the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined that may not exceed  to  for each period of twelve consecutive fiscal months of holdings as of april   we were in compliance with these covenants   lvmh note   on december   as a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of dki we issued to lvmh a junior lien secured promissory note in the principal amount of   million the “lvmh note” that bears interest at the rate of  per year  million of the principal amount of the lvmh note is due and payable on june   and  million of such principal amount is due and payable on december     in connection with the issuance of the lvmh note lvmh entered into i a subordination agreement with barclays bank plc as administrative agent for the lender parties to the term loans and collateral agent for the senior secured parties thereunder and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent for the lenders and other senior secured parties under the abl credit agreement providing that our obligations under the lvmh note are subordinate and junior to our obligations under the abl credit agreement and the term loans and ii a pledge and security agreement with us and our subsidiary giii leather fashions inc pursuant to which giii leather granted to lvmh a security interest in specified collateral to secure our payment and performance of our obligations under the lvmh note that is subordinate and junior to the security interest granted by us with respect to our obligations under the abl credit agreement and term loans   asc   fair value measurements requires the note to be recorded at fair value as a result we recorded a debt discount in the amount of  million this discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the lvmh note   outstanding borrowings   our primary operating cash requirements are to fund our seasonal buildup in inventories and accounts receivable primarily during the second and third fiscal quarters each year due to the seasonality of our business we generally reach our peak borrowings under our assetbased credit facility during our third fiscal quarter the primary sources to meet our operating cash requirements have been borrowings under our credit facility cash generated from operations and the sale of our common stock   we incurred significant additional debt in connection with our acquisition of dki at april   we had  million in borrowings outstanding under the abl credit agreement and  million in borrowings outstanding under the term loans at april   we had no borrowings outstanding under the prior credit agreement in addition to the amounts outstanding under these two loan agreements at april   we had  million of principal amount outstanding under the lvmh note our contingent liability under open letters of credit was approximately  million at april   compared to  million at april     we had cash and cash equivalents of  million on april   and  million on april     share repurchase program   our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of  shares the timing and actual number of shares repurchased if any will depend on a number of factors including market conditions and prevailing stock prices and are subject to compliance with certain covenants contained in our loan agreement share repurchases may take place on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or by other means and would be made in accordance with applicable securities laws no shares were purchased under the program during the three months ended april   as of april   we had approximately  million shares of common stock outstanding   cash from operating activities   we used  million of cash in operating activities during the three months ended april   primarily as a result of a decrease of  million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and our net loss of  million offset by a decrease in inventory of  million and a decrease in accounts receivable of  million          table of contents       the changes in these operating cash flow items are generally consistent with our seasonal pattern the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily attributable to vendor payments related to inventory purchases and the payment of accrued yearend bonuses in our first fiscal quarter our inventory decreased because we experience lower sales levels in our first and second fiscal quarters than in our third and fourth fiscal quarters    cash from investing activities   we used  million of cash in investing activities in the three months ended april   the cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures related to additional fixturing costs at department stores as well as to improving remodeling and relocating gh bass and wilsons stores   cash from financing activities   net proceeds of  million was provided by financing activities in the three months ended april   primarily as a result of the net proceeds of   million in borrowings under our revolving credit line   financing needs   we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations for the year as a whole together with funds available under the abl credit agreement are sufficient to meet our expected operating and capital expenditure requirements we may seek to acquire other businesses in order to expand our product offerings we may need additional financing in order to complete one or more acquisitions we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing if required on acceptable terms or at all   critical accounting policies   our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our consolidated

completed the acquisition of donna karan which made us the owner of two of the worlds most iconic and recognizable power brands in donna karan and dkny this acquisition further bolsters our value proposition and strengthens our position as an allseason diversified apparel company with a broad portfolio of brands offered in multiple channels of retail distribution our nonouterwear wholesale business performed well in the face of significant headwinds as the traditional retail environment has become increasingly disrupted as a result of evolving consumer buying behavior and continued penetration of ecommerce we expect to initiate a number of new product launches in the coming year as we seek to offer superior value in the marketplace mr goldfarb continued while our nearterm financial outlook reflects the dilutive impact of our recent acquisition of donna karan we believe the midyear relaunch of the dkny and donna karan brands will have a positive impact in the second

survivor immigrated to the united states and established his own outerwear company located in the heart of new york city’s garment district  as early as  giii began to diversify its offerings when morris goldfarb its current chief executive officer and son of its founder joined giii  morris introduced an entrepreneurial spirit to giii which has propelled the company for more than forty years  almost immediately giii expanded its sourcing becoming one of the first companies to import outerwear from south korea  this established a strong connection between giii and the pacific rim manufacturing zone which remains intact today in  giii began expanding by launching its first division siena leather limited an aspirational luxury leather sportswear company that catered to highend department stores  in  giii became publicly traded and began intensifying its expansion efforts the early ’s was a period of rapid growth for giii as it worked to broaden its outerwear offerings

july  giii acquired two very important businesses on the same day  by purchasing marvin richards and winlit giii consolidated with two of its largest competitors and set the stage for a transformation of giii which included a significant expansion of management merchandising manufacturing and design expertise  an immediate benefit of the marvin richards acquisition was the addition of licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the calvin klein brand name  the purchase of winlit granted giii licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the guess brand name  these extra licenses propelled giii to the forefront of the outerwear business  the acquisition of marvin richards had other benefits as well as giii expanded its calvin klein offerings to include women’s suits dresses performance wear sportswear handbags luggage and cold weather accessories  giii has become the second largest licensee for the calvin klein brand in  giii added to its dress portfolio with the acquisitions of

handbags and men’s denim and related sportswear  in  entering the retail arena giii purchased the wilsons leather retail outlet chain which now includes over  stores in over  states the expertise of the wilsons team has allowed giii to expand retail with the opening of a limited number of andrew marc outlet stores and calvin klein performance stores continuing diversification efforts giii seeks to broaden the company’s reach in crucial areas  for example building on the company’s license to produce calvin klein sportswear giii entered into an agreement in  to design and manufacture
