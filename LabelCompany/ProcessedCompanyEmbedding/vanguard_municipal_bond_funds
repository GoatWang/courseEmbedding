in the fund arestatespecific risk the chance that developments in the state such as tax legislative or political changes will adversely affect the securities held by the fund because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by one state and its municipalities it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in this state than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many statesincome risk the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates because the fund’s income is based on shortterm interest rates—which can fluctuate significantly over short periods—income risk is expected to be highcredit risk the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline credit risk should be very low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high qualitymanager risk the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objectivenondiversification risk the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities the fund is considered nondiversified which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual fundstax risk the chance that all or a portion of the taxexempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable possibly with retroactive effect because of unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state or local tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer the yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotation the fund is only available to retail
