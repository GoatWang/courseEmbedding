installation instructions viewdownload step files description technical the cmp products sovereign cable cleat range consists of metallic cable cleats which have been designed constructed and tested in accordance with the international standard ‘cable cleats for electrical installations’ iec  the sovereign cable cleat has been designed and tested for high short circuit conditions on cables held in trefoil application  formation to ensure the securing and retention of cables without damage the sovereign cable cleat is available for trefoil application  formation for diameters of mm to mm in  sizes the cable cleat is fabricated from l stainless steel giving it high creep strength whilst providing excellent corrosion resistance in the harshest of environments the sovereign cable cleat has one m and two m fixing clearance holes within its base allowing versatility to the installer during installation and is designed to enable the product to be secured to a variety of mounting surfaces the sovereign cable cleat hinge opens fully allowing the cables to be easily placed within the cable cleat to aid the installer before closing and securing via the mouth piece bolt low smoke  fume lfs zero halogen lsh and phosphorus free liners are standard helping to restrain the cables within vertical applications providing a layer of protection between the cable sheath and the cable cleat during normal operation where thermal elongation of cable occurs protecting the cable from chafing on any mounting surface due to differential movements such as those found in marine and offshore applications the low smoke  fume lsf zero halogen lsh and phosphorus free liners also assist in the extra protection of cables in the event of short circuit fault conditions third party certification
