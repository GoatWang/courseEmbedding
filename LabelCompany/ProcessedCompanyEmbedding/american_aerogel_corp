american aerogel member spotlight  nybest jump to navigation search form search user menu home contact us log in socialheader see other member spotlights american aerogel member spotlight ﻿ american aerogel corporation based in rochester ny develops and manufactures aerogels and related materials for temperaturesensitive shipping and other applications its products are used in various thermal insulation applications for the transportation of biomedical pharmaceutical diagnostic and other temperaturesensitive items  it is also developing conducting materials for use in electrochemical systems such as ultracapacitors batteries and fuel cells the company’s flagship product – aerocore® – is the only commercially available organicbased aerogel that exhibits low density small pore size extremely large surface area and high opacity  furthermore the properties of aerocore can be manipulated and optimized for specific applications and it can be manufactured in large volume at a fraction of the cost of traditional aerogels aerogels can be made electrically conductive and combined with their high surface areas this allows them to store massive amounts of electrical charge  for this purpose american aerogel uses a solgel polymerization technique to produce a synthetic carbon material  the properties of this material can be tailored with respect to morphology and porosity and the process yields consistent batchtobatch properties with no impurities or contaminants carbon electrodes for electrochemical devices are often made from agricultural precursor materials such as coconut husks and other waste products  the raw material costs for these products are negligible  pyrolysis of these materials yields carbon that is used in the devices but batchtobatch uniformity is poor and the properties of the resultant material cannot be tailored  in contrast american aerogel’s synthesized carbon material can be optimized to dramatically improve battery life and efficiency in portable electronics and increase the viability of new products such as electric vehicles and fuel cells  synthesized carbon materials are well known to have advantages over agricultural products but have generally been uncompetitive due to their cost   american aerogel’s extensive experience in manufacturing aerogel materials for insulation purposes has given them the ability to substantially drive down the costs of the conducting materials and thereby make them more attractive for commercialization what distinguishes the synthetic carbon material that american aerogel produces from competing materials is the ability to tailor its structural properties  in particular they can tailor the porosity of the material and even create multimodal porosities   materials are described as having macroporosity pores greater than  nm mesoporosity pores of  nm size or microporosity pores less than  nm   mesoporous materials are generally of greatest interest for electrochemical applications but more complex morphologies in which both mesoporous and macroporous regions are present bimodal or “lungtype” morphologies may offer advantages american aerogel sees electrochemical applications as a major opportunity for expanding the company’s business  robert mendenhall vice president of business development stated   “we are in a unique position relative to historical technology innovations to have both a recognized global need for energy solutions and the tools to address it  the customer demand is even stronger than a ‘need’  whoever puts the pieces together correctly will make an impact just as large as edison tesla and marconi at the beginning of the th century” at this point american aerogel is working with a number of partners in the energy storage industry to develop their materials further for use in batteries ultracapacitors and fuel cells  they have created a library of twenty materials of varying properties for use by these partners  these collaborative efforts are aimed at modifying and tailoring these materials to best address the needs of specific product areas  they are actively seeking additional partners for this effort as well  the company expects the transition of these materials from the laboratorytesting phase to commercialization to take place over the next few years american aerogel was founded in  and spent its first seven years perfecting its aerogel manufacturing process  its first pilot line came online in  and its manufacturing facility was completed in   it has already established itself as a performance leader in the field of aerogelbased insulation products and is now looking to expand its business into the growing energy storage industry based on its unique capabilities in advanced materials
