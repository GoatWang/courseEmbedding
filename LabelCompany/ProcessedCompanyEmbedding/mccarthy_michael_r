immigration court whenever my parents needed kim consultationadvice on my case kim returned the calls and made herself available as much as she could in the first meeting with my parents kimberly discussed the case defense strategy in a lot of detail explaining and drawing out a time line so we would be prepared she explained it so my parents could understand how kim would be handling my cases the defense strategies were very impressive to my parents and me they believed kim will win the immigration deportation case with the wonderful defense strategy thanks to her hard work kim was finally successful in cancelling the deportation proceedings against me at the immigration court currently kim trupiano is helping me with some other criminal charges to try to avoid more immigration consequences that would cause me to be deported to serbia – a country i don’t know at all anymore and where i don’t know anyone and which is away from all of my family here in the united states i am very happy to recommend attorney kim trupiano for whoever needs an experienced criminal and immigration attorney kimberly has a lot of experience in both immigration and criminal defense fields that is what makes it so she can be so successful in immigration cases with criminal history problems people who have criminal conviction are not always bad people and kim understands that another good thing is kimberly worked to accommodate the client’s financial capability to pay for legal fees kim had worked out a payment plan with a reasonable monthly payment so my parents and i can afford her helping methanks kim a lotemy cordano attorney at lawdebby j ratedmaybe emy is the best because she has a perspective from several countries i was fascinated to know emy is from south africa where she saw injustice in families daily i am just a local woman never been anywhere other than mexico on vacation or to north carolina to see my exhusbands family on a trip so as you can imagine i havent seen much hardship here in utah i think because of that i didnt know who to turn to my bishop advised i stay married so i did for a number of years unhappily my exhusband was mentally abusive you dont know just how bad it is until you cant leave the house without anxiety and you always doubt yourself and feel terribly about who you are you hate your reflection i spoke with emy and she set me on the path to rediscovering myself i was able to file divorce and she helped me when my bishop tried to advise me against it i am still an active member of the church but i came close to the edge and without emy holding my hand through the entire ordeal i may have caved emy helped file finalize and come out a better person from my divorce i have a home and can finally get back to finishing my degree and getting a job something my exhusband wouldnt let me do thank you emy for saving my life truly this isnt me being sappy it is me being thankful knowing someone was in my corner for me best wishes to you and yours always debby jschatz anderson and associatesreginaldosilva ratedtwo years ago today i hired sctwo years ago today i hired schatz anderson and associates i hired them out of slc because i work there although i live in cedar city charles stewart did everything he could to make sure my needs were met and that my concerns with the proceedings were always resolved being in the military this was sensitive case and could have resulted in me losing my security clearance and ultimately my job charles made sure to postpone the hearing long enough to resolve my deployment issues and made sure to push the trial when it needed to be resolved ultimately i was found not guilty in front of a jury trial if you know cedar city you will understand how hard this is cedar city is a zero tolerance city and the prosecuting attorney would not plea bargain charles drove from slc for all the hearings and even had a lawyer from st george that was more familiar with the cedar city system come in to help smooth things over with the small town locals charles knows all the ins and outs of the dui legal system he was able to break everything down and explain the technicalities of the situation to the jury helping them find me not guilty i am very pleased and hopefully will never have to go through this again but will make sure to let my friends in cedar city know about this firm thanks for everythingliberty law grouptimothytrent rated i highly recommend james i had him represent me in court to challenge a traffic citation due to a serious collision although the violation dictated a judgement against me there were some extenuating circumstances that i felt contributed to the accident that were due to the other drivers neglect and irresponsibility james was able to convince the prosecutor that the other driver was at fault and the citation was dismissed i was pretty surprised i was just hoping for a reduced fine after the hearing james told me how things played out with the prosecutor and it turned out that there were some circumstances in his meeting with the prosecutor that he was able to take advantage off that swung things in our favor in other words james knew the system saw an opportunity and acted on it ive worked with other attorneys with my divorce and never felt comfortable with them but felt very comfortable working with james and was confident that i was getting the best representation and would have still felt that way if things hadnt worked out as well as they didtrupiano law pcyennyp ratedi feel relieved today it was i feel relieved today it was a long immigration journey i have been going through and finally it was over with the great victory i hired kimberly trupiano representing me in applying for asylum and we got

while and uscis has granted me green card few days ago eventually i will be eligible to apply for us citizenship thanks kim and thanks god it is no doubt kimberly is very good handling the toughest immigration cases she is very knowledgeable aggressive and has a lot of experience practicing immigration law she tried her best to get the most positive outcome for my case i highly recommend kim for

planning  we didnt know where to begin and were overwhelmed with how much work we thought it would beworking with jonathan miller was the best decision we could have made he kept the process really simple and tailored it specifically to our needs we were able to fill out a simple questionnaire before our first meeting so that he had an idea of what we wanted to do with just a couple of brief office visits and a little information gathering on our own time we were able to have a trust in place for our family his price was more than reasonable and he was upfront with us about what was included we were pleasantly surprised that the estate planning process wasnt as long and painful as we had anticipated it was actually very simple to complete we only wish we had done it sooner we highly recommend jonathan miller for estate planning servicesemy cordano attorney at lawjessic s ratedemy helped me keep the roof over my head and that of my children we had only been married a year but had  children together he didnt cheat he didnt do anything horrible per se he simply decided one day not to be married anymore and told me to move out and that i could see my children  of the time i was gobsmacked and turned to emy for advice it didnt take long after our first meeting to feel that emy was on my side she was very down to earth asked a lot of questions but now i see why because i got the one thing from the divorce i needed more than child support i couldnt take my kids out of school move jobs and find a new home all at once so without emy i may have found myself homeless jobless and on the streets she is worth it thank you emy for a great experience and for a very fast divorce i hate to say it to anybody but if you are thinking about divorce have kids in the mix are worried about alimony and child support please think of emy emy cordano attorney at lawerica l ratedi was going through the motions of attempting to serve and gain consent from my sons biological father for a name change i did all the paperwork on my own but i lost faith when he continued to delay returning the signed consent form back to me emy gave me the courage and tools to stand up to him and let him know that i had her on my side if he delayed another month i should note that all i did was an hour consult with emy she provided me her rates if it did end up going to court but remained confident that i could finish what i started based on her advice emy is a unique lawyer that has a good grasp on the outcomes for family law she was compassionate and honest with me and that is greatly appreciated i did end up getting the consent form back and was able to change my sons last name to the appropriate one this month i couldnt thank her enough and im glad i have on my side if

inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily
