archives destinations investment insights video responding to rising interest rates posted on july   by brinkercapital reply in may federal reserve chairman ben bernanke announced the possibility that they will begin tapering in the upcoming months as that notion looms so too does the prospective of rising interest rates we sat down with bill miller chief investment officer and jeff raupp senior portfolio manager to discuss how brinker is prepared to respond to the upcoming policy changes  in this installment of investment insights bill and jeff will give financial advisors and investors a clearer understanding of the tools available to brinker capital and how our portfolios can manage the impending environment of rising interest rates   products and solutions are not interchangeable terms posted on november   by brinkercapital reply sue bergin in an attempt to appear as holistic financial service providers many advisors have stopped using the word product   solutions is the new phrase darling now a retirement solutions cloak drapes annuity sales income protection solutions describe disability insurance  it all sounds remarkably clientcentric and needs based oriented but often the advisor is simply recommending a product that fulfills a niche need the term product has gotten a bad rap because theoretically clients live happily ever after with solutions providers but have limited expectations of product salespeople  they consider a product sales person as onedimensional professional who meets a need then moves on to the next client products are implicit commission generating vehicles whereas solutions are holistic and in the client’s best interest the products have not changed  the sales servicing and payment to the advisor have not changed  the only difference in many cases is that whenever the client is in earshot products are referred to as solutions the approach might work when writing brochure copy but it leaves gaping holes in a client’s quest to achieve financial goals product and solution are not interchangeable terms  a product may solve a problem or it may be just one component to a solution  more often than not a solution involves more than one product and includes other services or features brinker capital’s income solutions for example go well beyond product  both our crystal diversified income strategy and our destinations balanced income strategy have income distribution features we also offer customized income distribution services  we deliver “paychecks” to clients for a specified period while managing reserves to cover their longterm capital growth needs  we also generate reports that include a spending analysis and notify clients if their portfolios are in jeopardy of falling short of stated goals you can only offer solutions when you analyze client needs holistically and extend your offering to include products services and technology that address the problem on all levels our destinations crystal suite personal portfolios and core asset manager products all solve specific client needs  on the other hand our personal distribution strategy dollar value averaging and asset class strategies are holistic solutions that combine product services and technologies that address client problems on all levels staying ahead of the curve despite recent volatility posted on june   by brinkercapital reply after a strong surge in global financial markets in the first quarter of  risk assets – equities commodities corporate credit – have sold off thus far in the second quarter uncertainties over global growth and europe have reentered markets at brinker capital we are not surprised that some of the euphoria is being worked off we would not be surprised to see further consolidation several of our fundamental and technical indicators were showing signs of concern earlier this spring at the end of the first quarter the various brinker discretionary portfolios reduced exposure to risk assets future signposts suggest the volatility could continue for those of you who follow our market outlook and quarterly portfolio calls this might be familiar material some of the indicators we monitor were flashing warning signals event risk – european elections particularly in france and greece along with stalling reform initiatives in spain and italy market fundamentals – economic indicators such as consumer and ceo confidence and economic surprises appeared to be peaking the sp  appeared to have discounted a lot of good news in valuations sentiment – though investors maintained bullish sentiment low levels of short interest corporate insiders were selling stock in  a change from insider purchases seen last fall as a result we reduced risk exposures across our various discretionary portfolios destinations and personal portfolios reduced exposure to risk assets and were positioned underweight risk compared to a neutral positioning crystal strategy i reduced its portfolio beta from positive to now a modestly negative beta by reducing risk and adding inverse exposures designed to rise in falling markets we will continue to monitor the following signposts over the near term and actively manage our broadly diversified portfolios as appropriate us – fed meetings later in june and prospects for further quantitative easing later this summer we need progress on addressing the massive fiscal cliff to be reached early in  regardless of the outcome in november elections europe – second round of greek elections on june  and progress or absence thereof regarding further
