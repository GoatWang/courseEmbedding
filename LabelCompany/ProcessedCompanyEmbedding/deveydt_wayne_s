cool in a crisis is what has allowed wellpoint to avoid hemorrhaging during the recession said wayne deveydt executive vice president and cfo wellpoint is one of the few companies outperforming the standard  poor’s  index this year “when you have significant economic downturns generally the thing that sets in is panic” deveydt said “i have a ceo and a board that does not panic” deveydt has kept his head as well in the midst of the worst economic crisis in generations he has helped the nation’s largest publicly traded health insurer log three straight years of record earnings per share eps grew  percent between  and  he is helping run a company with  employees  million customers and  revenue of  billion under his leadership wellpoint has divested of companies unrelated to its core business such as the  billion sale of its pharmacybenefits management business in  at the same time wellpoint has been acquiring companies with strong growth potential for example in august the company paid about  million to purchase californiabased caremore health group which offers medicare advantage plans and operates clinics in california arizona and nevada deveydt also has been a key

the nation’s largest medicare processor deveydt was named the top cfo in the managed care industry by institutional investor magazine in both  and  but deveydt said he is most proud of the people he has helped develop and move into leadership roles at the company assembling a strong team is the greatest gift you can give yourself as an executive he said “the best leaders i’ve ever seen in a company don’t know all the answers but they know all the questions” deveydt said “they know the questions to ask and who to ask rather than spending all their time telling people what they think the answer is” to get the broad perspective that type of leadership requires it helps to surround yourself with people different from yourself said deveydt who for two years has led wellpoint’s pride group for africanamerican employees the goal of the group is to make sure wellpoint is getting the best talent it can and eliciting the best ideas from that talent “i’m a huge huge fan of diversity on teams geographic diversity ethnic diversity demographic diversity” said deveydt who is the father of two black sons adopted from the democratic republic of the congo communication is the root of many corporate and even societal problems deveydt said so it’s an area of focus for him he started developing those skills early as a streetsmart kid growing up in a tough neighborhood in st louis the child of a single mother his mother always told him to keep things simple it’s advice he has tried to follow in his career and he is often praised for his ability to boil complex problems down to basics that the person on the street can understand prior to joining wellpoint deveydt was a partner with pricewaterhouse coopers llp where he had several major managed care and insurance companies including wellpoint as clients his advice to young people starting out in finance is to take a broad view of their role “view your job as a problem solver not as someone who logs debits and credits”
